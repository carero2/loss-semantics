      " Abstract: Background: This article asks the following question: how well are coal regions, affected by phase-out plans, represented in mediating commissions, to what extent do local communities participate in the decision-making process and how are the political negotiations perceived by the communities? We look at the case of the German lignite phase-out from a procedural justice perspective. Informed by literature on sociotechnical decline and procedural justice in energy transitions, we focus first on aspects of representation, participation and recognition within the German Commission on Growth, Structural Change and Employment (“Coal Commission”). Second, we analyze how to exnovate coal in two regions closely tied to the coal- and lignite-based energy history in Germany: Lusatia and the Rhenish Mining District. Results: Based on interview series in both regions, we connect insights from local communities with strategies for structural change and participation programs in the regions. We find significant differences between the two regions, which is primarily an effect of the challenging historical experiences in Lusatia. Participation within existing arrangements is not sufficient to solve these problems; they require a comprehensive strategy for the future of the regions. Conclusions: We conclude that the first phase-out process was a lost opportunity to initiate a community-inclusive sustainable transition process. As the phase-out process is not yet concluded, additional efforts and new strategies are needed to resolve the wicked problem of lignite phase-out. © 2024, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Other-perspective taking (OPT), distancing, time discounting as well as risk and loss aversion highly affect decision-making. Even though they influence each other, so far these cognitive processes have been unrelated or only partly related to each other in neuroscience. This article proposes a philosophical interpretation of these cognitive processes that is elaborated in the updated theory of Adam Smith’s prudence (UTSP). The UTSP is inspired by Smith’s account of prudence and is in line with the neuroscientific and behavioral studies on OPT, distancing, time discounting as well as risk and loss aversion. The UTSP represents a framework aiming to interpret and connect these cognitive processes and providing a consistent and empirically sound account of a “Smithianly” prudent style of decision-making. The two pillars of the UTSP are the shift of perspective in space and time (from the individual to others and from the present self to the future self) and loss aversion. On the basis of this theory, a normative updated theory of Smithian prudence is outlined (NUTSP). The latter is useful for moral philosophy for two reasons: firstly, according to preliminary evidence, it is effective in guiding the agent in decisional contexts in which her well-being is at stake and she can affect other people with her actions. Secondly, since the NUTSP is based on neuroscientific findings on decision-making, it has a sound empirical basis that prevents a source of alienation for the agent. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper, we investigate homeowner preferences and willingness to pay for wildfire protection programs using a choice experiment with three attributes: risk, loss and cost. Preference heterogeneity among survey respondents was examined using three econometric models and risk preferences were evaluated by comparing willingness to pay for wildfire protection programs against expected monetary losses. The results showed that while nearly all respondents had risk seeking preferences, a small segment of respondents were risk neutral or risk averse. Only respondents who had personal experience with the effects of wildfire consistently made trade-offs among risk, loss and cost and these respondents were willing to pay more for wildfire protection programs than were respondents without prior experience of the effects of wildfire. The degree to which people with prior experience with the effects of wildfire can effectively articulate an economic rationale for investing in wildfire protection to other members of their own or other communities facing the threat of wildfires may influence the overall success of wildfire protection programs. © IAWF 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Multi-class molecular cancer classification has great potential clinical implications. Such applications require statistical methods to accurately classify cancer types with a small subset of genes from thousands of genes in the data. Objectives: This paper presents a new functional gradient descent boosting algorithm that directly extends the HingeBoost algorithm from the binary case to the multi-class case without reducing the original problem to multiple binary problems. Methods: Minimizing a multi-class hinge loss with boosting technique, the proposed Hinge-Boost has good theoretical properties by implementing the Bayes decision rule and providing a unifying framework with either equalor unequal misclassification costs. Further - more, we propose Twin HingeBoost which has better feature selection behavior than Hinge-Boost by reducing the number of ineffective covariates. Simulated data, benchmark data and two cancer gene expression data sets are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Results: Simulations and the benchmark data showed that the multi-class HingeBoost generated accurate predictions when compared with the alternative methods, especially with highdimensional covariates. The multi-class Hinge-Boost also produced more accurate prediction or comparable prediction in two cancer classification problems using gene expression data. Conclusions: This work has shown that the HingeBoost provides a powerful tool for multi-classification problems. In many applications, the classification accuracy and feature selection behavior can be further improved when using Twin HingeBoost. © Schattauer 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Endoscopic resection (ER) with or without ablation is the first choice treatment for early Barrett’s neoplasia. Adequate staging is important to assure a good oncological outcome. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of pre-operative biopsies in patients who undergo ER for high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or early adenocarcinoma (EAC) in Barrett’s oesophagus (BE) and the cardia. Methods: Between November 2005–May 2012, 142 ERs performed in 137 patients were obtained. Worst pre-ER and ER histology were compared. Upgrading/downgrading was defined as any more/less severe histological grading on the ER specimen. Results: The accuracy of pre-ER biopsies in predicting final histology was 61%. ER changed the pre-treatment diagnosis in 55 of the 142 procedures (39%) with downgrading in 23 cases (16%) and upgrading from HGD to T1a or T1b in 32 cases (23%). In the majority of upgraded cases, a visible lesion according to the Paris classification could be detected (26/32, 81%). Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of oesophageal biopsies alone in predicting final pathology in Barrett’s dysplasia is only 61%. The majority of upgraded lesions are detectable. When ablative therapy is considered in HGD Barrett's dysplasia a meticulous inspection for and removal of all small visible lesions is mandatory. © 2016, © Author(s) 2016.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Despite a steady increase in population since the 1930s, farmers on Rusinga Island in Kenya have abandoned many traditional intensive agricultural practices, including the construction of hillside terraces. At the same time, low crop yields have led to a chronic shortage of food on the island. This paper, based on an analysis of archival materials and a detailed agronomic study of the farming system, analyzes the causes of this process of disintensification. Labor scarcity resulting from migrant wage employment and the growing importance of the fishing industry has been a major factor in the decline of agriculture on the island. The loss of soil conservation practices and serious weed infestations have contributed to the collapse of farm productivity. This study highlights the importance of understanding not only the local ecology but also the broader political and economic environment in order to explain farmers' decisions and the process of agricultural change. © 1994 Plenum Publishing Corporation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Data incompleteness becomes a frequent phenomenon in a large number of contemporary database applications such as web autonomous databases, big data, and crowd-sourced databases. Processing skyline queries over incomplete databases impose a number of challenges that negatively influence processing the skyline queries. Most importantly, the skylines derived from incomplete databases are also incomplete in which some values are missing. Retrieving skylines with missing values is undesirable, particularly, for recommendation and decision-making systems. Furthermore, running skyline queries on a database with incomplete data raises a number of issues influence processing skyline queries such as losing the transitivity property of the skyline technique and cyclic dominance between the tuples. The issue of estimating the missing values of skylines has been discussed and examined in the database literature. Most recently, several studies have suggested exploiting the crowd-sourced databases in order to estimate the missing values by generating plausible values using the crowd. Crowd-sourced databases have proved to be a powerful solution to perform user-given tasks by integrating human intelligence and experience to process the tasks. However, task processing using crowd-sourced incurs additional monetary cost and increases the time latency. Also, it is not always possible to produce a satisfactory result that meets the user's preferences. This paper proposes an approach for estimating the missing values of the skylines by first exploiting the available data and utilizes the implicit relationships between the attributes in order to impute the missing values of the skylines. This process aims at reducing the number of values to be estimated using the crowd when local estimation is inappropriate. Intensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets have been accomplished. The experimental results have proven that the proposed approach for estimating the missing values of the skylines over crowd-sourced enabled incomplete databases is scalable and outperforms the other existing approaches. © 2013 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The authors demonstrate the use of a terahertz quantum cascade laser (QCL) for real-time imaging in transmission mode at a standoff distance of 25 meters. Lasing frequency was selected for optimum transmission within an atmospheric window at ∼4.9 THz. Coarse frequency selection was made by design of the QCL gain medium. Finer selection (to within 0.1 THz) was made by judicious choice of laser cavity length to adjust facet losses and therefore lasing threshold bias, in order to overlap the peak frequency of the Stark-shifted gain spectrum with the atmospheric window.

      " Abstract: This article prognosticates where periodontology will be in the next millennium. The forecasting of such events is wrought with confusion because such predictions are shadowed by bias, dogmatism, prejudice, experiences, and opinions from either a closed or open mind. The results of the survey from 101 periodontists reflect opinions from varied backgrounds, years of clinical experience, and individual levels of success or failure. The responses cannot be tested for accuracy or duplicated by another survey except to wait out the test of time for the year 2025. Clinicians will be challenged to make decisions on accepting new techniques and concepts as these are brought into the therapeutic fold of periodontics. The clinician will be met with new possibilities as a paradigm shift is inevitable for periodontal practice in the next millennium. After all, who would have thought in the 1960s, the soft tissue augmentation era, that 22 years later in 1982, the regeneration of the lost attachment apparatus (alveolar bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament) would become a reality. This survey strongly suggests that by the end of the first quarter of the twenty-first century, local delivery of antimicrobials, growth and differentiation factors, and root biomodification agents will have a major impact on the practice of periodontics. One thing is certain, in the next millennium, considering the responses from this survey, a new era in periodontics will be here. By the year 2025, the research, development, and dissemination of new periodontal knowledge will be beyond the imagination from what was considered usual and customary for the twentieth century.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background Continued, persistent gambling to recover accumulating losses, or ‘loss-chasing’, is a behavioral pattern linked particularly closely to gambling disorder (GD) but may reflect impaired decision-making processes relevant to drug addictions like cocaine-use disorder (CUD). However, little is known regarding the neurocognitive mechanisms of this complex, maladaptive behavior, particularly in individuals with addictive disorders. Methods Seventy participants (25 GD, 18 CUD, and 27 healthy comparison (HC)) completed a loss-chase task during fMRI. Engagement of functional brain networks in response to losing outcomes and during decision-making periods preceding choices to loss-chase or to quit chasing losses were investigated using independent component analysis (ICA). An exploratory factor analysis was performed to examine patterns of coordinated engagement across identified networks. Results In GD relative to HC and CUD participants, choices to quit chasing were associated with greater engagement of a medial frontal executive-processing network. By comparison, CUD participants exhibited altered engagement of a striato-amygdala motivational network in response to losing outcomes as compared to HC, and during decision-making as compared to GD. Several other networks were differentially engaged during loss-chase relative to quit-chasing choices, but did not differ across participant groups. Exploratory factor analysis identified a system of coordinated activity across prefrontal executive-control networks that was greater in GD and CUD relative to HC participants and was associated with increased chasing persistence across all participants. Conclusions Results provide evidence of shared and distinct neurobiological mechanisms in substance and behavioral addictions, and lend insight into potential cognitive interventions targeting loss-chasing behavior in GD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

Hallböök, J. Rutegård, et al (2007) A Randomized Multicenter Trial Ann Surg 246:207-14; [La stomie de dérivation réduit le taux de fistule symptomatique après résection antérieure basse du rectum. Une étude multicentrique randomisée]\n",
      " Abstract: Objective: The aim of this randomized multicenter trial was to assess the rate of symptomatic anastomotic leakage in patients operated on with low anterior resection for rectal cancer and who were intraoperatively randomized to a defunctioning stoma or not. Summary Background Data: The introduction of total mesorectal excision surgery as the surgical technique of choice for carcinoma in the lower and mid rectum has led to decreased local recurrence and improved oncological results. Despite these advances, perioperative morbidity remains a major issue, and the most feared complication is symptomatic anastomotic leakage. The role of the defunctioning stoma in regard to anastomotic leakage is controversial and has not been assessed in any randomized trial of sufficient size. Methods: From December 1999 to June 2005, a total of 234 patients were randomized to a defunctioning loop stoma or no loop stoma. Loop ileostomy or loop transverse colostomy was at the choice of the surgeon. Inclusion criteria for randomization were expected survival > 6 months, informed consent, anastomosis < or = 7 cm above the anal verge, negative air leakage test, intact anastomotic rings, and absence of major intraoperative adverse events. Results: The overall rate of symptomatic leakage was 19.2% (45 of 234). Patients randomized to a defunctioning stoma (n=116) had leakage in 10.3% (12 of 116) and those without stoma (n=118) in 28% (33 of 118) (odds ratio: 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-6.9; P < 0.001). The need for urgent abdominal reoperation was 8.6% (10 of 116) in those randomized to stoma and 25.4% (30 of 118) in those without (P < 0.001). After a follow-up of median 42 months (range, 6-72 months), 13.8% (16 of 116) of the initially defunctioned patients still had a stoma of any kind, compared with 16.9% (20 of 118) those not defunctioned (not significant). The 30-day mortality after anterior resection was 0.4% (1 of 234) and after elective reversal a defunctioning stoma 0.9% (1 of 111).

      " Abstract: Background: Hepatic artery infusion pump (HAIP) with floxuridine/dexamethasone and systemic chemotherapy is an established treatment regimen, which had been reported about converting 47% of patients with stage 4 colorectal liver metastasis from unresectable to resectable.1,2 To this effect, HAIP chemotherapy contributes to prolonged survival of many patients, which otherwise may not have other treatment options. Biliary sclerosis, however, is a known complication of the HAIP treatment, which occurs in approximately 5.5% of patients receiving this modality as an adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy and in 2% of patients receiving HAIP treatment for unresectable disease.3 While biliary sclerosis diffusely affects the perihilar and intrahepatic biliary tree, a dominant stricture maybe found in select cases, which gives an opportunity for a local surgical treatment after failure of endoscopic stenting/dilations. While the use of minimally invasive approach to biliary surgery is gradually increasing,4 there have been no descriptions of its application in this scenario. In this video, we demonstrate the use of minimally invasive robotic technique for biliary stricturoplasty and Roux-en-Y (RY) hepaticojejunostomy to treat persistent right hepatic duct stricture after HAIP chemotherapy. Patient: A 68-year-old woman with history of multifocal bilobar stage 4 colorectal liver metastasis presented to our office with obstructive jaundice and recurrent cholangitis that required nine endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies (ERCPs) and a placement of internal-external percutaneous transhepatic biliary drain (PTBD) by interventional radiology within the past 2 years. Her past surgical history was consistent with laparoscopic right hemicolectomy 3 years prior, followed by a left lateral sectorectomy with placement of an HAIP for adjuvant treatment. The patient had more than ten metastatic liver lesions within the right and left lobe, ranging from 2 to 3 cm in size at the time of HAIP placement. The patient had a histologically normal background liver parenchyma before the HAIP chemotherapy treatment. The patient did not have any history of alcohol use, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or other underlying intrinsic liver disorders, which are known to contribute to the development of hepatic fibrosis. Despite a radiologically disease-free status, the patient started to have episodes of acute cholangitis 1 year after the placement of HAIP that required multiple admissions to a local hospital. The HAIP was subsequently removed once the diagnosis of biliary sclerosis was made despite dose reductions and treatment with intrahepatic dexamethasone for almost 1 year. In addition to this finding, the known liver metastases have shown complete radiological resolution. Therefore further treatment with HAIP was deemed unnecessary, and pump removal was undertaken. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a dominant stricture at the junction of the right anterior and right posterior sectoral hepatic duct. The location of the dominant stricture was confirmed by an ERCP and cholangioscopy. Absence of neoplasia was confirmed with multiple cholangioscopic biopsies. Multiple endoscopic and percutaneous attempts with stent placement failed to dilate the area of stricture. Postprocedural cholangiographies showed a persistent significant narrowing, which led to multiple recurrent obstructive jaundice and severe cholangitis. While the use of surgical approach is rarely needed in the treatment of biliary sclerosis, a decision was made after extensive multidisciplinary discussions to perform a robotic stricturoplasty and RY hepaticojejunostomy with preservation of the native common bile duct. Technique: The operation began with a laparoscopic adhesiolysis to allow for identification of HAIP tubing (which was later removed) and placement of robotic ports. A peripheral liver biopsy was obtained to evaluate the degree of hepatic parenchymal fibrosis. Porta hepatic area was carefully exposed without causing an inadvertent injury to the surrounding hollow organs. Biopsy of perihepatic soft tissues was taken as appropriate to rule out any extrahepatic disease. The common bile duct and common hepatic duct with ERCP stents within it were identified with the use of ultrasonography. Anterior wall of the common hepatic duct was then opened, exposing the two plastic stents. Cephalad extension of the choledochotomy was made toward the biliary bifurcation and the right hepatic duct. The distal common bile duct was preserved for future endoscopic access to the biliary tree. After lowering the right-sided hilar plate, dense fibrosis around the right hepatic duct was divided sharply with robotic scissors, achieving a mechanical release of the dominant stricture. An intraoperative cholangioscopy was performed to confirm adequate openings of the right hepatic duct secondary and tertiary radicles, as well as patency of the left hepatic duct. A 4-Fr Fogarty catheter was used to sweep the potential biliary debris from within the right and left hepatic lobe. Finally, a confirmatory choledochoscopy was performed to ensure patency and clearance of the right-sided intrahepatic biliary ducts and the left hepatic duct before fashioning the hepaticojejunostomy. A 40-cm antecolic roux limb was next prepared for the RY hepaticojejunostomy. A side-to-side double staple technique was utilized to create the jejunojejunostomy. The common enterotomy was closed in a running watertight fashion. Once the roux limb was transposed to the porta hepatic in a tension-free manner, a side-to-side hepaticojejunostomy was constructed in a running fashion by using absorbable barbed sutures. The index suture was placed at 9 o’clock location, and the posterior wall of the anastomosis was run toward 3 o’clock location. This stabilized the roux limb to the bile duct. The anterior wall of the anastomosis was next fashioned by using a running technique from both corners of the anastomosis toward the middle (12 o’clock), where both sutures were tied together. This completed a wide side-to-side hepaticojejunostomy anastomosis encompassing the upper common hepatic duct, biliary bifurcation, and the right hepatic duct. A closed suction drain was placed before closing.5 Results: The operative time was approximately 4 hr with 60 ml of blood loss. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged home on postoperative Day 5 after removal of the closed suction drain, confirming the absence of bile leak. The patient had developed periportal/periductal fibrosis, cholestasis, and moderate-severe parenchymal fibrosis (F3–F4) based on liver biopsy, often seen in patients treated with a long course of floxuridine HAIP chemotherapy. The patient is clinically doing well at 1 year outpatient follow-up without any evidence of recurrent cholangitis at the time of this manuscript preparation. Conclusions: Robotic biliary stricturoplasty with RY hepaticojejunostomy for treatment of biliary sclerosis after HAIP chemotherapy is safe and feasible. Appropriate experience in minimally invasive hepatobiliary surgery is necessary to achieve this goal. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The choice of an assessment criterion for heat exchangers is crucial regarding the sustainability of processes and has troubled engineers for decades. In this paper it is shown that the basis for a physically meaningful assessment of every energy transfer (including conversions from one form of energy to another) lies in the correct interpretation of entropy generation. First it is shown that the effect of components in energy transfer situations on the available work (e.g. the power outcome of a working process) results from the flows of energy and entropy and the generation of entropy in a component. Next the entropic potential loss number assessment criterion is introduced, based on the entropic potential of an energy flow. It is explained how this universal criterion allows the assessment of arbitrary situations in energy transfer, illustrated by showing the advantages over the often used thermo-hydraulic performance parameter. Two examples show how the concept can be applied in numerical assessments and optimizations of heat exchangers and other components as well as in the assessment of processes. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The major key attributes of decision-making during emergency to de-escalate disaster, reduce fatality and prevent asset loss are time and the efficiency of the process. Decision-makers faced the challenge of accessing adequate and precise information during emergency cases due to the time limitation, inadequate data on and about the disasters and thus decision-making process becomes complex and complicated. A well-advanced and developed mathematical tool is required to respond adequately in the presence of these challenges. The current study investigates the effects of post-flood management plans in Iran through sustainable development features in the possible early time. A new hybrid emergency decision-making approach integrating the best–worst method (BWM), Z numbers and zero‐sum game is proposed to ensure much more effective responses in realistic cases. The importance weights of criteria are computed using the BWM, the payoff assessments of decision-makers are collected employing the Z numbers, and finally, the zero‐sum game method is utilized to rank the alternative of emergency solutions. The proposed hybrid approach assists the decision-makers to deal decisively with the ambiguity associated with the data for assessing and evaluating the emergency circumstances. To show the efficiency of the proposed approach, a real-life example of the Golestan flood of 2019 is presented. More so, a comparison analysis is performed to assess the practicability and feasibility of the proposed hybrid approach. The result indicates that the proposed methodology has considerable merits compared with the existing tools and can adequately deal with these shortages. In this case, the aircraft emergency delivery system of the relief supplies is obtained as the best solution to the problem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of kernel estimation of the Expected Shortfall (ES) risk measure for financial losses that satisfy the α-mixing conditions. First, we introduce a new non-parametric estimator for the ES measure using a kernel estimation. Given that the ES measure is the sum of the Value-at-Risk and the mean-excess function, we provide an estimation of the ES as a sum of the estimators of these two components. Our new estimator has a closed-form expression that depends on the choice of the kernel smoothing function, and we derive these expressions in the case of Gaussian, Uniform, and Epanechnikov kernel functions. We study the asymptotic properties of this new estimator and compare it to the Scaillet estimator. Capitalizing on the properties of these two estimators, we combine them to create a new estimator for the ES which reduces the bias and lowers the mean square error. The combined estimator shows better stability with respect to the choice of the kernel smoothing parameter. Our findings are illustrated through some numerical examples that help us to assess the small sample properties of the different estimators considered in this paper. © 2024 The Author(s)\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In everyday life, people often make decisions on behalf of others. The current study investigates whether risk preferences of decision-makers differ when the reference point is no longer their own money but somebody else money. Thirty four healthy participants performed three different monetary risky choices tasks by making decisions for oneself and for another unknown person. Results showed that loss aversion bias was significantly reduced when participants were choosing on behalf of another person compared to when choosing for themselves. The influence of emotions like regret on decision-making may explain these results. We discuss the importance of the sense of responsibility embodied in the emotion of regret in modulating economic decisions for self but not for others. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the Risk-asfeelings hypothesis, suggesting that self-other asymmetrical behavior is due to the extent the decision-maker is affected by the real and emotional consequences of his/her decision. © 2014 Mengarelli et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this article, Bayesian estimation of the two-component mixture of transmuted Fréchet distribution assuming type-I right censored sampling scheme is discussed. In order to estimate the unknown parameters, we consider non-informative and informative priors under squared error loss function, precautionary loss function and quadratic loss function, respectively. Furthermore, Bayesian credible intervals of the model are also discussed. Since the posterior distribution is not in close form, we present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to obtain different posterior summaries, including Bayes estimates, posterior risks and credible intervals. The performance of Bayes estimators under different loss functions has been compared in terms of their respective posterior risks by analyzing the simulated and real-life data sets in terms of different sample sizes and censoring rates. Two reliability data sets are also analyzed in this study. Significance In life testing experiments, including prior information related to the phenomenon under investigation helps us in making prediction. To save time and cost, we have utilized the concept of type-I censoring and derived the Bayes estimators and posterior risks of the mixture of Transmuted Fréchet distribution. Using simulated and reliability data sets, a comparison assuming different types of priors and loss functions is also given in this study. The choice of transmuted distribution is done on the basis of its flexibility to model skewed data.

      " Abstract: This study comprises (1) an analysis of recent climate trends at two sites in north-west India (Ludhiana in Punjab and Delhi) and (2) an impact and risk assessment for wheat yields associated with climatic variability. North-west Indian agriculture is dominated by rice-wheat rotation in which the wheat season ('rabi', November to March) is characterized by predominantly dry conditions-superimposed by very high inter-annual variability of rainfall (17 to 260 mm in Ludhiana and <1 to 155 mm in Delhi). While rainfall remained without discernable trend over the last three decades, minimum and average temperatures showed increasing trends of 0.06 and 0.03°C year-1, respectively, at Ludhiana. The site in (metropolitan) Delhi was apparently influenced by city-effects, which was noticeable from the decrease in solar radiation of 0.09 MJ m∈-∈2 day-1 year -1. The CERES-wheat model was used to calculate yields of rainfed wheat that were at both locations highly correlated with seasonal rainfall. An assessment framework was developed to quantify yield impacts due to rainfall variability in three steps: (1) data from different years were aggregated into four classes, i.e., years with scarce, low, moderate, and high rainfall, (2) yield records of each rainfall class were ranked according to yield to facilitate (3) a comparison of yields with identical rank, i.e. among the best yield of each class, the second-best, etc. The class with moderate rainfall was taken as baseline yield to compute yield impacts of other rainfall scenarios. Years with scarce rainfall resulted in only 34% (Ludhiana) and 35% (Delhi) of the baseline yield. The yields in years with low rainfall accounted for 61% (Delhi) and 49% (Ludhiana) of the baseline yields. In Ludhiana, high rainfall years resulted in 200% yield as compared to the baseline yield, whereas they reached only 105% in Delhi. Low-intensity (1× and 3×) irrigation decreased the relative yield losses, but entailed a higher vulnerability in terms of absolute yield losses. Only high-intensity (4×) irrigation buffered wheat yields against adverse rainfall years. Early sowing was beneficial for wheat yields under all rainfall scenarios. The framework could be a valuable decision-support tool at the farm level where seasonal rainfall variability is high. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

Between spring 2009 and autumn 2011, radical nephrectomies were performed in 12 patients due to a large kidney tumor (larger than 14 cm in size). Symptoms (hematuria, weight loss, anemia, etc.) were not present in all the patients, but the kidney tumor was confirmed by imaging studies (ultrasound, CT, MRI) in all of them. Results. Full recovery was observed with no severe complications in all of the patients treated with radical nephrectomy. Pathological staging was correctly established by imaging studies in all of them.

Patients with large kidney tumors should be treated in selected medical centers that have experience in the treatment of such cases. Radical nephrectomy has to be the method of choice in the treatment of patients with this kind of tumor and its diameter should not disqualify from surgical treatment, which is still the only chance for the patients to be cured, as no adjuvant chemotherapy treatment has proved to be significantly effective.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Large-scale wildfires have become more frequent in Greece and coupled with the country’s limited economic resources, investments in both pre-fire planning and post-fire rehabilitation for most affected areas are not feasible. From the perspective of forest and fire management agencies, the severity and importance of fire effects are evaluated based only on total area burned, while from a societal standpoint, by the number of fatalities and destroyed houses. A holistic approach to rank wildfires with an inclusive assessment of all their effects is missing. We developed a new evaluation and ranking index based on expert judgment, the study of 50 large-scale fire events in Greece and a detailed review of the literature, to develop a set of categories and criteria to assess ecological and socioeconomic effects of wildfires. The Fire Inventory and Ranking of Effects (FIRE) Index provides a comprehensive and easy-to-use semi-numeric framework that combines scores from seven fire effects categories and 56 criteria through a user-friendly web-platform. The seven categories include fire effects on landscape and vegetation, general environmental impacts, regeneration potential and vegetation recovery, casualties and fatalities, destruction and damages to infrastructure, economic losses, and firefighting and wildfire suppression. Each of the 56 criteria within these categories describes a different anticipated fire effect. The magnitude of each fire effect criterion is estimated by predefined ranked choices by one or more persons/assessors in a multi-level evaluation procedure. We apply the FIRE Index assessment to a significant 5900-ha wildfire that occurred in 2011 in northern Greece, including a sensitivity analysis of how different category weights impact the final index score. More diverse metrics to assess wildfire effects will help address the complex social and biophysical dimensions of the wildfire governance challenge and help guide pre-and post-fire management actions. © 2020 by the authors.

      " Abstract: Aim of study: Diagnosing the degradation degree of forest ecosystems is the basis for restoration strategies. However, there is no literature documenting how to quantify the forest degradation degree by using synthetic indicators, also because there is not a widely accepted definition for “forest degradation” and “degraded forest”. Although there are many definitions of forest degradation that converge on the loss of ecosystem services, still today there are no largely accepted methods that give operational guidance to help in defining it. In the present research, with the aim to assess the degree of forest degradation, an integrated index - FDI, Forest Degradation Index - was developed. Area of study: In this first application, the FDI was applied and validated at stand level in two different Mediterranean forest types in two different case studies: Madonie and Nedrodi regional Parks (Sicily, Italy). The first dominated by sessile oak [Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl. subsp. austrotyrrhenica Brullo, Guarino & Siracusa], the second dominated by cork oak (Quercus suber L.). Material and methods: FDI is a synthetic index structured starting from representative and relatively easily detectable parameters. Here, we propose a set of six indicators that should be assessed to determine the forest degradation: Structural Index (SI), Canopy Cover (CC), Natural Regeneration Density (NRD), Focal Species of Degradation (FSD), Coarse Woody Debris (CWD), and Soil Depth (SD). FDI, here proposed and discussed, has been based on a MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) approach using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique, and implemented in order to contribute in finding simple indicators useful for forest restoration purposes that have an eco-functional basis. Main results: An integrated index of forest degradation has been defined. FDI values are comprised in the closed interval [0, 10], ranging from class I (Higher ecological functionality) to class IV (Lower ecological functionality). A forest fallen in the FDI-IV class can be defined degraded. In this first application, degradation occurs in SA-4 and in SB-4 where the lowest values (qualitative and quantitative) of the indicators were recorded and the FDI reach the minimum value. Research highlights: FDI has proved to be a useful tool at stand level in identifying a threshold value below which a forest can be termed as ‘degraded’. In turn, FDI assumes the meaning of descriptor of the ecological functionality. Future development of the FDI will provide an extension of the application at landscape scale exploiting the potential advantages in coupling MCDA and GIS (Geographical Information Systems) techniques. © 2015 INIA.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore stander use in individuals with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). METHODS: This mixed method research study employed a survey with categorical and open-ended questions related to stander use. Categorical responses were analyzed quantitatively. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses was linked to the International Classification of Function. Qualitative and quantitative results were merged to derive meta-inferences. RESULTS: Of 147 respondents, 28.6% (n = 42) reported stander use. Equipment used included sit-to-stand stander (n = 27), power standing feature in a wheelchair (n = 13), and unspecified equipment (n = 2). Economic services were the most common barrier to stander obtainment. Age of loss of ambulation (LOA) and age of start of stander use were positively correlated (r = 0.61, p < 0.0001, n = 36), with 59.5% initiating stander use after LOA. Twenty-nine respondents reported standing less than the recommended dose of 60-90 minutes at least five days a week, with frequency directionally less than five days per week (p = 0.06) and time significantly less than 60-90 minutes (p = 0.002). Respondents' total dose was significantly lower than the recommended 300 minutes (p = 0.02). Lack of time and presence of contractures contributed to decreased duration of use. CONCLUSION: This study provides a greater understanding of stander use among individuals with DMD and can assist with decision making about stander use prior to complications of disease progression to promote optimal health despite reported barriers. © 2023 - IOS Press.

      " Abstract: Using data from England and Wales, we analyze the relationship between house prices and transaction volume (number of houses sold) and find that there is a negative relationship. When we decompose price changes into anticipated and unanticipated components we find that while anticipated house price changes positively affect transaction volume, unanticipated price changes have a negative effect. These findings give insights for the theories which try to explain the relationship between house prices and transaction volume. Our findings are inconsistent with the \"down-payment effect\" approach developed by Stein (1995) and Ortalo-Magne and Rady (2006), and with the \"loss aversion behavior\" approach discussed by Genesove and Mayer (2001). However, our results support the evidence of asymmetric decisions on the buyer and seller side documented in Case and Shiller (1988) and partially support the mechanisms in search and matching models. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is a worldwide pathogen of Vitis negatively affecting wine production. In red berry cultivars grown in New Zealand, the foliar changes to GLRaV-3-infected vines inform decisions on vine removal (roguing). However, roguing does not always contain GLRaV-3 spread in the presence of an insect vector like the mealybug, Pseudococcus calceolariae. Virus incidence and mealybug abundance data collected annually over 7 years were modelled under differing scenarios to ascertain support for roguing. In a simulated 1 ha vineyard planted in 2500 mature Merlot vines, simulations over 20 years evaluated the effectiveness of roguing, ‘rogue 1 + 2’ (concurrent roguing of symptomatic plus both within-row neighbouring vines), inefficient roguing (50% of symptomatic vines rogued), and ‘no-action’. The model used variable initial GLRaV-3 incidence (0.4, 5, 10, 15 and 20%), and low, median and high vector densities (6, 26 and 75 mealybugs per 100 vine leaves, respectively). Roguing was the optimal response to GLRaV-3, independent of the initial incidence, but results were vector density dependent. At a low vector density, roguing relative to the other responses tested, sustained the lowest annual GLRaV-3 incidence, the least need to plant replacement vines and the lowest estimated average annual costs plus loss of income. At median and high vector densities, roguing remained the most favourable response but virus control was less effective and the costs incurred were higher. Thus, for vineyards affected by GLRaV-3, achieving economic sustainability relies on integrating efficient roguing with effective vector management. © 2021, Società Italiana di Patologia Vegetale (S.I.Pa.V.).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Many ecologists are concerned that biodiversity loss from human impact on natural ecosystems could compromise ecosystem stability. A relationship between diversity and stability was proposed by MacArthur [MacArthur, R.H., 1955. Fluctuation of animal populations and a measure of community stability. Ecology 36, 533-536.]. Current thinking (for example, McCann, K., 2000. The diversity-stability debate. Nature 405, 228-233.) acknowledges that interaction pattern among species, rather than species richness per se, is one element of this relationship. Dunne et al. [Dunne, J.A., Williams, R.J., Martinez, N.D., 2002a. Network structure and biodiversity loss in food webs: robustness increases with connectance. Ecol. Lett. 5, 558-567.] showed that the robustness of 16 food webs is correlated with their connectance. Connectance is one measure of interaction pattern. Robustness relates to the maintenance of network integrity and so has consequences for stability; the loss of integrity must have ecosystem-wide implications. This paper tests the hypothesis that changes in a food web's connectance indicate changes in its robustness. It concludes that any change in connectance with species loss, but especially large, negative changes, constitutes a decrease in robustness. Estimation of the change in connectance could support interpretation of monitoring data on species composition, acting as an indicator of food web robustness and, indirectly, of ecosystem stability. It could assist managers to understand the implications of biodiversity loss caused by human intervention in ecosystems, and could assist either choice of intervention or amelioration of impacts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

      " Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for the optimal design of queueing systems of call centers with delay information. The main decisions in the design of such systems are the number of servers, the appropriate control to announce delay anticipated. Design/methodology/approach - This paper models a multi-server queueing system as an M/M/S+M queue with customer reactions. Based on customer psychology in waiting experiences, a number of different service-level definitions are structured and the explicit computation of their performance measures is performed. This paper characterizes the level of satisfaction with delay information tomodulate customer reactions. Optimality is defined as the number of agents that maximize revenues net of staffing costs. Findings - Numerical studies show that the solutions to optimal design of staffing levels and delay information exhibit interesting differences, especially U-shaped curve for optimal staffing level. Experiments show how call center managers can determine economically optimal anticipated delay and number of servers so that they could control the trade-off between revenue loss and customer satisfaction. Originality/value - Many results that pertain to announcing delay information, customer reactions, and links to satisfaction with delay information have not been established in previous studies, however, this paper analytically characterizes these performance measures for staffing call centers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: Presently, Indian sectors are manifesting a higher level of interdependency and making the economy more vulnerable to human-caused and natural disasters. COVID-19 pandemic creates a devastating effect on the world economy. The Indian economy was expected to lose around ₹ 32,000 crores every day during the first 21 days of complete lockdown. This motivates to conduct the research on how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the port logistics sector and how the effects of COVID-19 on port logistics propagate to other sectors owing to its interconnectedness and affect the economy of the country. Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of the study is analyze how perturbation in one sector can affect the system of interdependent sectors and it is done with interdependency analysis. It uses Wassily Leontief’s inoperability input-output model (IIM) and interval programming (IP) to develop a framework. IP is used to address situations where assumptions are not valid because of uncertainties associated with disruptive events. Findings: The model helps in describing how the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in port logistics can propagate owing to the interconnectedness across other sectors. The model uses the latest five-year data available on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development database. It uses metrics like inoperability and economic loss to study the consequences of COVID-19 pandemic on various sectors. This study also presents the ranking of the affected sectors based on their inoperability and economic loss Research limitations/implications: In the future study, other techniques like dynamic evolution, multiplex network analysis, analytical hierarchy process, pinch analysis, stochastic evolution and pinch graph could be integrated with input-output (I-O) modelling. Integrated stochastic evolution with an I-O model allows capturing the likelihood of the events; it includes probability distributions instead of point estimates for scenario parameters. Methods like dynamic evolution and multiplex network analysis can be introduced in future work to shed lights on interdependency among the sector, which could potentially provide additional insights for transport policy formulations. Originality/value: This study discusses the theory, methodology and application of the IIM-IP model in the domain of port logistics. The developed IIM-IP model helps decision-makers to manage risk in port logistics. Firstly, it studies how different sectors are interconnected with each other. Secondly, it helps in identifying the most vulnerable sectors based on economic loss and inoperability. Thirdly, it provides the ranking of the sectors based on their economic losses. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Congestive heart failure carries immense importance in the realm of public health. This significance arises from its substantial influence on the number of lives lost, economic burdens, the potential for prevention, and the opportunity to enhance the well-being of both individuals and the broader community through decision-making in healthcare. Several researchers have proposed neural networks for classification of different congestive heart failure categories. However, there is little information about the confidence of the prediction on short-term series. Therefore, evaluating classification models is required for effective decision-making in healthcare. This paper explores the use of three classical variants of neural networks to classify three groups of patients with congestive heart failure. The study considered the iterative method Multilayer Perceptron neural network (MLP), two non-iterative models (Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Random Vector Functional Link Network (RVFL)), and the CNN approach. The results showed that the deep feature learning system obtained better classification rates than MLP, ELM, and RVFL. Several scenarios designed by coupling some deep feature maps with the RVFL and MLP models showed very high simulation accuracy. The overall accuracy rate of CNN–MLP and CNN–RVFL varies between 98% and 99%. © 2023 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Nowadays most retrofit decisions are based on reducing CO2 / heating consumption. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of three tools (RdSAP, SAP and IES) often used to predict these reductions. Three no-fines concrete (NFC) dwellings (C1, C2, and C3) with similar floor area and construction but different occupants were monitored. Key information about the thermal performance of the fabric; the behaviour of the occupants and the energy consumption was collected before and after 110 mm of external wall insulation (EWI) was added. The target was a 30% reduction on energy consumption due to the EWI. However, only C3 decreased it by 30% as expected, C2 only by 14% due to a subtle rebound effect and C1 actually increased consumption by 75%, due to rebound effect. Steady state tools (RdSAP and SAP) were found to be inaccurate in predicting the operational energy consumption of dwellings, only dynamic performance analysis software (IES) was suitable to carry out this type of prediction accurately. However, this type of software requires highly accurate and detailed information regarding: the baseline performance of the fabric, external weather conditions and, most importantly, accurate pre- and post- heating operational habits of the occupants. Few retrofitting projects have the resources and time to gather this information. Unless those are available, the retrofit decisions should be based in a different criteria, rather than using inaccurate SAP or RdSAP energy consumption predictions. The coefficient of heat loss of the fabric of a dwelling is independent of the occupants. SAP was found quick to calculate reasonable predictions of the coefficient, by using accurate fabric data, and to show the impact of different factors on the heat loss of the fabric. Therefore, it could be claimed that the coefficient of heat loss of the fabric is a suitable alternative criteria to make pre-retrofit decisions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

It is found under the CVaR measure that the newsvendors optimal order quantity is increasing in the confidence level when the understock loss is bigger than the overstock loss. This implies that an over-ordering may be even more caused by the newsvendors risk aversion about opportunity loss than risk seeking behaviour. Under this optimal order quantity, it is proved that the newsvendors expected profit and expected opportunity loss are decreasing and increasing in the confidence level, respectively. Furthermore, some management insights are presented to facilitate the risk management of the newsvendor model. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

Healthy Amistad aimed to address four behaviors: physical inactivity, nutrition choices, smoking, and seeking access to health care. The evaluation employed a mixed-method study design to assess changes in the health of individuals in the program. Process measures assessed the implementation of the program. A pre-post examination was used to compare data associated with behaviors. Data sources included the 2008 and 2009 annual surveys, clinical data, interviews for staff, interviews with members, and an on-site observation. Participants were staff and members of Amistad. Those involved with the Peer Patient Navigator lost weight; new physically active activities were being offered. A new salad bar and healthier menu was offered in the Amistad cafeteria. Interviews revealed that 11 members lost a total of 150 pounds. The percentage reporting visits to an emergency room more than once in the last 6 months decreased from 58% to 37%, the percentage calling the crisis line less often increased from 75% to 86%, and the percentage reporting that they had become more satisfied with their life since joining Amistad improved from 76% to 88%.

This paper examines the probability judgments made by auditors for their financial statement footnote disclosure decisions and their audit report additional paragraph decisions in the presence of material loss contingencies. In the United States these judgments are governed by SFAS No. 5 and SAS No. 58. Two prior studies have reported inconsistent results pertaining to the degree of compliance of auditors with the judgment and decision‐making process implied by SFAS No. 5. In contrast, SAS No. 58 has not previously been examined with respect to auditor compliance. Results from an experiment with 64 audit partners from six firms were consistent with the hypothesis that audit partners employ the same (compensatory) judgment process when making footnote disclosure decisions as when making additional paragraph decisions. This process led the partners to make judgments for the additional paragraph decision that were in accordance with SAS No. 58. In contrast, their judgments for the footnote disclosure decision were consistent with a decision theory model of auditor behavior rather than the noncompensatory process implied by SFAS No. 5. Additional aspects of the study pertain to the additional paragraph decision of auditors. Observed judgments for these decisions are consistent with the hypothesis that additional information is conveyed beyond that provided by only a footnote disclosure. This is contrary to some recent discussions of the standards. Résumé.  Les auteurs étudient les jugements relatifs aux probabilités portés par les vérificateurs dans le cadre de leurs décisions relatives à la présentation des pertes éventuelles importantes sous forme de notes infrapaginales dans les états financiers ou de paragraphes supplémentaires dans le rapport des vérificateurs.

Par opposition, leurs jugements relatifs à la présentation sous forme de notes infrapaginales étaient conformes à un modèle de comportement du vérificateur inspiré de la théorie de la décision plutôt qu'au processus non compensatoire que suppose le SFAS no 5.

      " Abstract: Background/Objective: Death in intensive care units (ICUs) may increase bereaved family members’ risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, posttraumatic stress-related symptoms (hereafter as PTSD symptoms) and their precipitating factors were seldom examined among bereaved family members and primarily focused on associations between PTSD symptoms and patient/family characteristics. We aimed to investigate the course and predictors of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members of deceased ICU patients by focusing on modifiable quality indicators for end-of-life ICU care. Method: In this longitudinal observational study, 319 family members of deceased ICU patients were consecutively recruited from medical ICUs from two Taiwanese medical centers. PTSD symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 13 months post-loss using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Family satisfaction with end-of-life care in ICUs was assessed at 1 month post-loss. End-of-life care received in ICUs was documented over the patient’s ICU stay. Predictors for developing clinically significant PTSD symptoms (IES-R score ≥ 33) were identified by multivariate logistic regression with generalized estimating equation modeling. Results: The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms decreased significantly over time (from 11.0% at 1 month to 1.6% at 13 months post-loss). Longer ICU stays (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.036 [1.006, 1.066]), financial insufficiency (3.166 [1.159, 8.647]), and reported use of pain medications (3.408 [1.230, 9.441]) by family members were associated with a higher likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members during bereavement. Stronger perceived social support (0.937 [0.911, 0.965]) and having a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order issued before the patient’s death (0.073 [0.011, 0.490]) were associated with a lower likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms. No significant association was observed for family members’ satisfaction with end-of-life care (0.988 [0.944, 1.034]) or decision-making in ICUs (0.980 [0.944, 1.018]). Conclusions: The likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members decreased significantly over the first bereavement year and was lower when a DNR order was issued before death. Enhancing social support and facilitating a DNR order may reduce the trauma of ICU death of a beloved for family members at risk for developing clinically significant PTSD symptoms. © 2021, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Designed by nature for stimulating, inhibiting or regulating numerous life functions, for a long time peptides have been considered ideal agents for therapeutic applications. In recent years, radiolabelled peptides have emerged as a new, useful class of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis of a variety of endocrine tumours. Although clinical results with111ln- and123I-labelled peptides have been excellent, extensive efforts have been made in preparing and evaluating peptides labelled with99Tcm. This is the radionuclide of choice by virtue of its cost-effectiveness, availability and desirable nuclear characteristics. With99Tcm, certain peptides can be labelled 'directly' without a loss of functional specificity, but certain peptides must be labelled using bifunctional chelating agents. The bifunctional chelating agent methods are chemically complex and frequently inefficient. Instant kit preparations are, however, possible. Important tests in the evaluation of these agents are receptor binding assays as well as examinations in experimental pre-clinical models. Peptides are small and can be taken up in target tissues non- specifically by increased capillary permeability. However, something that is frequently forgotten during such evaluations are control studies with non-specific peptides of similar size and charge. Radiolabelled peptides aimed at instant in vivo interaction with neutrophils or platelets must also be examined carefully to ensure that they do not induce neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia. The preparation of radiolabelled peptides is not only challenging but also exciting, since these agents will continue to be promising and rewarding radiopharmaceuticals for decades to come. © 1995 Chapman and Hall Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Small-scale fisheries in Kenya contribute about 4.7% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in spite of high post-harvest losses. Post-harvest interventions in fisheries enable fishers and fish processors to reduce waste, maintain nutritional aspects and meet stringent demands in food quality and safety. This review highlights the benefits and pitfalls of various fish post-harvest management interventions in order to drive policy dialogue and formulation of a regulatory framework for future interventions. It relies on data obtained from the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute and the State Department of Fisheries and Blue Economy. Results depict abundant interventions in both handling and processing, but low utilization (<40% of installed cold rooms, dryers and smoking kilns) and multiplication by fishing communities. Fish products that target export markets have well-organized structures. However, a weak regulatory framework is a key constraint in addressing post-harvest management of fish intended for the domestic market. Under-utilization of installed interventions results in continued waste of fish, contributing to food and nutritional insecurity. This review recommends the development of an effective and integrative policy framework that involves interactions across different domains, institutional mechanisms that monitor and address those interactions, analytical bases for decision making, and multi-stakeholder dialogue for post-harvest management. Such policies will enhance the adoption of post-harvest technology in small-scale fisheries in Kenya and elsewhere. © 2019, International Society for Plant Pathology and Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The microstructure and mechanical performance of wood-based filament is investigated in the case of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technique using experimental and numerical approaches. The printing process of wood-PLA/PHAis conducted by varying the printing temperature, typically from 210 °C to 250 °C. The filament temperature during the laying down is measured using infra-red camera to study the thermal cycling. In addition, X-ray micro-tomography is used to evaluate the material arrangement of printed wood-PLA/PHA at different length scales. Tensile experiments are performed to rank the loss in mechanical performance with respect to the filament properties. Finally, finite element computation is considered to predict the tensile behaviour based on the implementation of the real 3D microstructure issued from X-ray micro-tomography. The results show that the wood-based filament is printable over a wide range of temperatures and exhibits a marked heat accumulation tendency at high printing temperatures. However, the limited gain in tensile performance at these temperatures makes 220 °C an optimal choice for printing wood-based filament. The elongation at break of 3D-printed wood-PLA/PHA is remarkably similar to the results observed for the filament. Finite element computation reveals that despite this apparent similarity, the associated deformation mechanisms are different. © 2019 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are inclined towards speculative usage due to the inherent high risk of financial loss and the potential for substantial gains during transaction completion. In response to this phenomenon, this study represents the inaugural effort to explore the influence of variables such as subjective norms, domain knowledge, impulsive investment tendencies, and self-control on decisions related to speculative investments. Utilising structural equation modelling with a dataset of 367 responses in India, the study is the first of its kind. The research reveals that subjective norms and domain knowledge play a significant role in influencing impulsive investment and self-control. Additionally, impulsive investment exhibits significant associations with decisions involving speculative investments. This insight underscores the complexity wherein individuals, despite exercising self-control, may still engage in speculative decisions that lead to adverse consequences. The findings have practical implications for investors and regulators, offering valuable insights into investment behaviours within the cryptocurrency realm. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Many funding institutions and development agencies are facing the same challenge when considering the sustainability of their investment portfolio in agriculture: the livestock sector has a large environmental footprint, the most pressing one being its contribution to climate change, but it is essential for food security, nutrition and livelihoods for billions of poor people in the world. While other challenges such as biodiversity losses or land degradation are growing and should also be addressed, climate change is the number one concern these organizations are facing now, and even more so since the Global Methane Pledge launched in 2021. The choice should not be whether or not to invest in livestock but rather how to invest, and we argue that a share of the emission budget should be allocated to livestock given its multiple positive contributions. Improving livestock production will not only be beneficial for nutrition and incomes but it is also key if we are to achieve our current climate targets. To be able to account for these benefits while accurately measuring greenhouse gas emissions, and to reflect this in national climate commitments, we need specific data, tools and capacity which are currently not available in all countries. It is the role of science to continue providing references in a diversity of local contexts to better estimate emissions and advise how to reduce them. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Intermittent fasting (IF) and Paleolithic (Paleo) diets produce weight loss in controlled trials, but minimal evidence exists regarding long-term efficacy under free-living conditions without intense dietetic support. Objectives: This exploratory, observational analysis examined adherence, dietary intake, weight loss, and metabolic outcomes in overweight adults who could choose to follow Mediterranean, IF, or Paleo diets, and standard exercise or high-intensity interval training (HIIT) programs, as part of a 12-mo randomized controlled trial investigating how different monitoring strategies influenced weight loss (control, daily self-weighing, hunger training, diet/exercise app, brief support). Methods: A total of 250 overweight [BMI (in kg/m2) ≥27] healthy adults attended an individualized dietary education session (30 min) relevant to their self-selected diet. Dietary intake (3-d weighed diet records), weight, body composition, blood pressure, physical activity (0, 6, and 12 mo), and blood indexes (0 and 12 mo) were assessed. Mean (95% CI) changes from baseline were estimated using regression models. No correction was made for multiple tests. Results: Although 54.4% chose IF, 27.2% Mediterranean, and 18.4% Paleo diets originally, only 54% (IF), 57% (Mediterranean), and 35% (Paleo) participants were still following their chosen diet at 12 mo (self-reported). At 12 mo, weight loss was-4.0 kg (95% CI:-5.1,-2.8 kg) in IF,-2.8 kg (-4.4,-1.2 kg) in Mediterranean, and-1.8 kg (-4.0, 0.5 kg) in Paleo participants. Sensitivity analyses showed that, due to substantial dropout, these may be overestimated by ≤1.2 kg, whereas diet adherence increased mean weight loss by 1.1, 1.8, and 0.3 kg, respectively. Reduced systolic blood pressure was observed with IF (-4.9 mm Hg;-7.2,-2.6 mm Hg) and Mediterranean (-5.9 mm Hg;-9.0,-2.7 mm Hg) diets, and reduced glycated hemoglobin with the Mediterranean diet (-0.8 mmol/mol;-1.2,-0.4 mmol/mol). However, the between-group differences in most outcomes were not significant and these comparisons may be confounded due to the nonrandomized design. Conclusions: Small differences in metabolic outcomes were apparent in participants following self-selected diets without intensive ongoing dietary support, even though dietary adherence declined rapidly. However, results should be interpreted with caution given the exploratory nature of analyses.

Patients aged 16–85 who underwent RPN, LPN, or OPN from 2007 to 2014 for localized renal carcinoma within our healthcare system were enrolled. Age, sex, body mass index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) as well as perioperative outcomes of estimated blood loss (EBL), length of hospital stay (LOS), ischemia time (IT), change in eGFR, positive margin rate, operative time (OT), and emergency room visit rates were compared between RPN, LPN, and OPN using the R.E.N.A.L nephrometry score. A total of 862 patients underwent partial nephrectomy (523 LPN, 176 OPN, and 163 RPN). Patients who underwent OPN were significantly older, and had higher nephrometry scores and CCI. When matched for nephrometry scores, minimally invasive (LPN and RPN) compared to OPN had lower EBL (< 0.0001), shorter LOS (< 0.0001), shorter IT (< 0.001), and less change in eGFR (< 0.001), particularly in nephrometry scores higher than 8 (0.0099). Comparing RPN with LPN, RPN had significantly shorter OT in all nephrometry scores (< 0.001); shorter IT and LOS in nephrometry scores higher than 7. Our study suggests that minimally invasive partial nephrectomy may have superior outcomes to OPN when matched by nephrometry scores, particularly at higher scores and for RPN.

At each step specific shortcomings were identified: a great number of commonly accepted risk factors was not looked for (e.g. outcome of previous pregnancies in a woman in labour). On the other hand, information indicating risk was collected, but not recognized as such (e.g. weight loss). The most striking feature of both under fives' (UFC), antenatal clinics (ANC) and maternity care was the consistent lack of any action taken as a consequence of a recognized risk factor. The possible underlying causes for the poor functioning of the risk approach in the studied peripheral services are discussed: (i) implementation failure, (ii) inappropriateness of cut-off points for risk definition leading to an unmanageably great proportion of risk clients, and (iii) a conceptual problem, i.e. the reluctance of the auxiliary staff as well as the patients to act on the basis of risk prediction, i.e. something that has not yet happened.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Sentiment analysis has broad application prospects in the field of social opinion mining. The openness and invisibility of the internet makes users' expression styles more diverse and thus results in the blooming of complicated contexts in which different unimodal data have inconsistent sentiment tendencies. However, most sentiment analysis algorithms only focus on designing multimodal fusion methods without preserving the individual semantics of each unimodal data. To avoid misunderstandings caused by ambiguity and sarcasm in complicated contexts, we propose a multimodal mutual attention-based sentiment analysis (MMSA) framework adapted to complicated contexts, which consists of three levels of subtasks to preserve the unimodal unique semantics and enhance the common semantics, to mine the association between unique semantics and common semantics and to balance decisions from unique and common semantics. In the framework, a multiperspective and hierarchical fusion (MHF) module is developed to fully fuse multimodal data, in which different modalities are mutually constrained and the fusion order is adjusted in the next step to enhance cross-modal complementarity. To balance the data, we calculate the loss by applying different weights to positive and negative samples. The experimental results on the CH-SIMS multimodal dataset show that our method outperforms existing multimodal sentiment analysis algorithms.The code of this work is available at https://gitee.com/viviziqing/mmsacode.  © 1991-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

Results show that bottom and top layer should have a symmetric arrangement; square plate or the similar should be the best choice, and viscoelastic thickness to total thickness ratio should take different values as the length to total thickness ratio (b/h) varies: the b/h value of less than 77.7 corresponding to hc/h value of 0.9; b/h value of 77.7–131.5 corresponding to hc/h value of 0.8; b/h value of 131.5–202.1 corresponding to hc/h value of 0.7; last, the range of b/h value is greater and greater, hc/h value corresponding to the maximum loss factor gradually tends to 0.5. © 2017\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: With the convenience and flexibility, the UAV has received more attention in the search and rescue. Due to inherent mobility of UAV, the aerial backbone network maybe suffers some problems of dynamics of connectivity, such as uncertain delay jitter or occasional connection interruption. However, the existing mobility model could not accurately capture aerial mobility without the smooth trajectory and the capacity of rapid coverage. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility model based on spiral line (SLMM) for aerial backbone network. Firstly, we describe the background and related work. Then, we propose the basic concept and advantages of SLMM. In addition, we investigate the mathematical feature of SLMM. Besides, we propose some novel mobility metrics and analyze quantitatively the mobility feature of SLMM through simulation. Finally, we evaluate the network performance under the SLMM. The result show that the SLMM has the smooth trajectory and the uniform distribution of spatial nodes at steady state. In addition, covering the zone of area of 16pi the aerial node merely take almost 27s under the SLMM. Meanwhile, the convergence time could be adjusted by changing the internal parameters. Moreover, the aerial backbone network could approach the throughput of 0.43Mb/s, the end-to-end delay of 4.42ms and the packet loss rate of nearly 0.00%° under the SLMM, and the best choice of routing strategy is the AODV protocol.

      " Abstract: Nerve biopsy is most often a final step in the evaluation of patients with peripheral neuropathy. The procedure should always be expected to result in varying degree of sensory loss within the innervation area of the biopsied nerve and chronic pain in the area may also occur. Therefore appropriate informed consent must be obtained and a weighing of such side effects and benefits for the patient, particularly therapeutical consequences, should be seriously considered before the procedure is performed. The surgical procedure and the processing in the laboratory of the nerve material must hold a high standard at all levels. Nerve biopsy should not be performed before adequate clinical, electrophysiological and laboratory investigations have been performed. The choice of nerve is important, but in most instances the sural nerve is biopsied, although the superficial peroneal nerve is also an option and allows an easy access to muscle biopsy in the same procedure. Laboratories performing nerve biopsies should have the facilities and expertise to prepare and evaluate fixed and frozen sections (paraffin, cryostat and epoxy-sections) and teased fibers, and also to perform light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Although not routinely used, the option of morphometry should be available as well. We recommend that properly trained technicians start the processing procedures in the operating room and, if feasible, even in hospitals outside that of the hospital with nerve laboratory. We also prefer routine use of teased fiber analysis as this visualizes in an excellent way pathological processes like axonal degeneration, demyelination and remyelination as well as other features. Evaluation of small fiber neuropathy is rarely an indication for nerve biopsy and should be investigated with skin biopsy and visualization and quantification of intraepidermal nerve fibers.

In terms of an out-of-sample loss function measure, portfolio strategies based on the objective-based priors can substantially outperform both strategies under alternative priors and some of the best strategies developed in the classical framework.

      " Abstract: Fast and equitable distribution of the humanitarian relief supplies is key to the success of relief operations. Delayed and inequitable deliveries can result in suffering of affected people and loss of lives. In this study, we analyze the routing operations for the delivery of relief supplies from a distribution center to the dispensing sites. We assume that the relief supplies to be distributed arrive at the distribution center in batches and are consumed at the dispensing sites with a certain daily rate. When forming delivery schedules, we use the ratio of the inventory to the daily consumption rate at the dispensing sites as our decision criterion. This ratio is called the slack and can be considered as the safety stock (when positive) in case of a delay in the deliveries. Negative value for the slack means the dispensing site has stock-outs. Our objective is to maximize the minimum value of this slack among all dispensing sites. This is equivalent to maximizing the minimum safety stock or minimizing the maximum duration of the stock-outs. Due to multi-period structure of the problem, it is modeled as a variant of the Inventory Routing Problem. To address the problem, we propose a general framework which includes clustering, routing and improvement steps. The proposed framework considers the interdependence between all three types of decisions (clustering, routing and resource allocation) and makes the decisions in an integrated manner. We test the proposed framework on randomly generated instances and compare its performance against the benchmark algorithms in the literature. The proposed framework not only outperforms the benchmark algorithms by at least 1% less optimality gap but also provides high-quality solutions with around 2–3% optimality gaps. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We investigate the problem of finding frequent patterns in a continuous stream of transactions. In the literature, two prominent approaches are often used: (a) perform approximate counting (e.g., lossy counting algorithm (LCA) of Manku and Motwani, VLDB 2002) by using a lower support threshold than the one given by the user, or (b) maintain a running sample (e.g., reservoir sampling (Algo-Z) of Vitter, TOMS 1985) and generate frequent itemsets from the sample on demand. Although both are known to be practically useful, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no comparison between them. In addition, we propose a distance based sampling algorithm (DSS). An empirical comparison study on the algorithms is performed using synthetic and benchmark datasets. Results show that DSS is consistently more accurate than LCA and Algo-Z, whereas LCA performs better than Algo-Z. An outcome of this study is a new algorithm CLCA.

      " Abstract: Pigeons prefer a low-probability, high-payoff but suboptimal alternative over a reliable low-payoff optimal alternative (i.e., one that results in more food). This finding is analogous to suboptimal human monetary gambling because in both cases there appears to be an overemphasis of the occurrence of the winning event (a jackpot) and an underemphasis of losing events. In the present research we found that pigeons chose suboptimally to the degree that they were impulsive as indexed by the steeper slope of the hyperbolic delay-discounting function (i.e., the shorter the delay they would accept in a smaller-sooner/larger-later procedure). These correlational findings have implications for the mechanisms underlying suboptimal choice by humans (e.g., problem gamblers) and they suggest that high baseline levels of impulsivity can enhance acquisition of a gambling habit. © 2013 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Brucellosis is endemic in the bovine population in India and causes a loss of US$ 3·4 billion to the livestock industry besides having a significant human health impact. Methods: We developed a stochastic simulation model to estimate the impact of three alternative vaccination strategies on the prevalence of Brucella infection in the bovine populations in India for the next two decades: (a) annual mass vaccination only for the replacement calves and (b) vaccination of both the adult and young population at the beginning of the program followed by an annual vaccination of the replacement calves and, (c) annual mass vaccination of replacements for a decade followed by a decade of a test and slaughter strategy. Findings: For all interventions, our results indicate that the prevalence of Brucella infection will drop below 2% in cattle and, below 3% in buffalo after 20 years of the implementation of a disease control program. For cattle, the Net Present Value (NPV) was found to be US $ 4·16 billion for intervention (a), US $ 8·31 billion for intervention (b) and, US $ 4·26 for intervention (c). For buffalo, the corresponding NPVs were US $ 8·77 billion, US $ 13·42 and, US $ 7·66, respectively. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) for the first, second and the third intervention for cattle were 7·98, 10·62 and, 3·16, respectively. Corresponding BCR estimates for buffalo were 17·81, 21·27 and, 3·79, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that all interventions will be cost-effective with the intervention (b), i.e. the vaccination of replacements with mass vaccination at the beginning of the program, being the most cost-effective choice. Further, sensitivity analysis revealed that all interventions will be cost-effective even at the 50% of the current prevalence estimates.

      " Abstract: Polymer composites prove to be the best choice for improving the dielectric properties of polymers. This work mainly focuses on studying the dielectric behavior of polyaryletherketone (PAEK), a high-temperature polymer, and its nanocomposite films with CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) ceramics. The dielectric constant of PAEK improves significantly after the addition of CCTO nanoceramics and shows nearly frequency-independent behavior. The dielectric loss of these nanocomposites is low and is in the range of 0.004-0.006 at room temperature and 1 kHz. Dielectric properties exhibit very good temperature stability up to 150 °C. Activation energies calculated from both electric modulus and conductivity analyses show that the movement of charge carriers is responsible for both relaxation and conduction processes. The conductivity mechanism follows the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) model at low temperatures and the nonoverlapping small polaron tunneling (NSPT) model at high temperatures. Breakdown characteristics are analyzed using Weibull probability distribution. These PAEK/CCTO nanocomposites are proposed as potential materials for high-temperature dielectric applications.  © 1994-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: The most appropriate treatment of laryngeal nonsquamous malignancies is a controversial subject, mainly because of the limited number of cases diagnosed. Surgery, which is an obligatory choice in nearly all cases, is sometimes indiscriminately demolitive despite the relatively low locoregional aggressiveness that characterizes certain histotypes and locations. Even in extremely aggressive tumors, where the prognosis is almost invariably unfavorable because of distant metastasis, the suitability of radical surgery should be carefully assessed, especially considering the patient's remaining life quality. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the postsurgical oncological results in a series of consecutive patients with laryngeal nonsquamous primary malignancy. Methods: We analyzed retrospectively 29 consecutive patients with laryngeal nonsquamous malignancies of whom 10 underwent total laryngectomy and 19 conservative surgery (partial laryngectomies). Results: Of the 29 patients with of laryngeal nonsquamous malignancies, 16 were alive and free from disease after treatment, 5 died of other causes, 1 was lost at follow-up, and 7 died of the disease. Statistical analysis failed in disclosing a significantly different local recurrence rate after conservative surgery vs radical surgery after a mean follow-up period of 5.5 years. Conclusions: From the preliminary data emerging from the study, it seems that in nonsquamous malignancies of the larynx, the surgical approach should be the most conservative surgery possible, tailored to neoplasm extent and patient conditions. Although cervical lymph node metastases are unusual, long-term follow-up is mandatory considering the relatively high incidence of distant metastases even after years. © 2008.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Land reclamation has been highly intensive in China, resulting in a large amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss to the atmosphere. Evaluating the factors which drive SOC dynamics and carbon sequestration potential in reclaimed land is critical for improving soil fertility and mitigating global warming. This study aims to determine the current status and factors important to the SOC density in a typical reclaimed land located in Eastern China, where land reclamation has been undergoing for centuries. A total of 4746 topsoil samples were collected from 2007 to 2010. The SOC density of the reclaimed land (3.18 ± 0.05 kg C m-2; mean ± standard error) is significantly lower than that of the adjacent non-reclaimed land (5.71 ± 0.04 kg C m-2) (p < 0.05). A Random Forest model is developed and it captures the relationships between the SOC density and the environmental/anthropogenic factors (R2 = 0.59). The soil pH, land use, and elevation are the most important factors for determining SOC dynamics. In contrast, the effect of the reclamation age on the SOC density is negligible, where SOC content in the land reclaimed during years 1047-1724 is as low as that reclaimed during years 1945-2004. The scenario analysis results indicate that the carbon sequestration potential of the reclaimed lands may achieve a maximum of 5.80 ± 1.81 kg CO2 m-2 (mean ± SD) when dryland is converted to flooded land with vegetable-rice cropping system and soil pH of ~5.9. Note that in some scenarios the methane emission substantially offsets the carbon sequestration potential, especially for continuous rice cropping system. With the optimal setting for carbon sequestration, it is estimated that the dryland reclaimed in the last 50 years in China is able to sequester 0.12 million tons CO2 equivalent per year. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: Concerns about the harms of prognostic information, including distress and loss of hope, cause some physicians to avoid frank disclosure. We aimed to determine parent preferences for prognostic information about their children with cancer and the results of receiving such information. Patients and Methods: We surveyed 194 parents of children with cancer (overall response rate, 70%), treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital (Boston, MA) and the children's physicians. Our main outcome measure was parent rating of prognostic information as extremely or very upsetting. Results: The majority of parents desired as much information about prognosis as possible (87%) and wanted it expressed numerically (85%). Although 36% of parents found information about prognosis to be extremely or very upsetting, those parents were more likely to want additional information about prognosis than those who were less upset (P = .01). Parents who found information upsetting were no less likely to say that knowing prognosis was important (P = .39), that knowing prognosis helped in decision making (P = .40), or that hope for a cure kept them going (P = .72). Conclusion: Although many parents find prognostic information about their children with cancer upsetting, parents who are upset by prognostic information are no less likely to want it.

      " Abstract: Electronic health records provide a vast amount of text health data written by physicians as patient clinical notes. The world health organization released the international classification of diseases version 10 (ICD-10) system to monitor and analyze clinical notes. ICD-10 is system physicians and other healthcare providers use to classify and code all diagnoses and symptom records in conjunction with hospital care. Therefore, the data can be easily stored, retrieved, and analyzed for decision-making. In order to address the problem, this paper introduces a system to classify the clinical notes to ICD-10 codes. This paper examines 7541 clinical notes collected from a health institute in Jordan and annotated by ICD-10’s coders. In addition, the research uses another outsource dataset to augment the actual dataset. The research presented many approaches, such as the baseline and pipeline models. The Baseline model employed several methods like Word2vec embedding for representing the text. The model structure also involves long-short-term memory a convolutional neural network, and two fully-connected layers. The second Pipeline approach adopts the transformer model, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), which is pre-trained on a similar health domain. The Pipeline model builds on two BERT models. The first model classifies the category codes representing the first three characters of ICD-10. The second BERT model uses the outputs from the general BERT model (first model) as input for the special BERT (second model) to classify the clinical notes into total codes of ICD-10. Moreover, Baseline and Pipeline models applied the Focal loss function to eliminate the imbalanced classes. However, The Pipeline model demonstrates a significant performance by evaluating it over the F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy metric, which are 92.5%, 84.9%, 91.8%, and 84.97%, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

With the widespread acceptance of robotic surgery, robotic-assisted laparoscopic ureteral reimplant (RALUR) is becoming the preferred choice for performing ureteral reimplant. We present our single-institution and single-surgeon experience of performing RALUR. Materials and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 40 patients who underwent RALUR at our institute in the last 5 years. Demographic data were recorded along with presenting complaint and diagnosis. Intraoperative variables included operative and docking time, blood loss, intraoperative complications, technique, and procedure performed. Postoperative data that were analyzed included complications, hospital stay, and outcomes. Patient satisfaction score was calculated using a numerical scale of points 1-6. Results: The mean age of patients was 31.5 ± 9.8 years (r = 4-45). Male: female ratio was 3:5. The most common presenting symptom was flank pain, and the most common etiology was iatrogenic strictures in adults and congenital vesicoureteral reflux in children. The mean operative time and blood loss were 135.3 ± 45.1 min (r = 84-221) and 67.7 ± 31.4 ml (r = 32-118), respectively. There were no intraoperative complications and nil conversion to open surgery. The mean length of hospital stay was 4.5 ± 2.3 days (r = 3-9). Radiographic success was achieved in 41 out of 44 ureters. Eighty-five percent of the patients were completely satisfied with robotic approach and its outcomes.

      " Abstract: Choosing an appropriate contraceptive method, particularly one based on fertility awareness, depends in part upon the degree of a woman's cycling regularity. However, while the suppressive effect of lactation on ovarian function is well established, the potential influence of continued breastfeeding on menstrual patterns once post-partum cycling has resumed is largely unexamined. This longitudinal study in a population of non-contracepting Aymara women (n = 191 providing 665 non-truncated menstrual segments) identified conceptions and fetal loss via urine tests for hCG and classified segments accordingly to test the hypotheses that (1) cycles in lactating women are significantly different in length and regularity from those of non-lactating women, and (2) cycles in women living at high altitude are significantly different in length and regularity from those at lower altitudes. Analyses found that segments are significantly longer and regularity tends to be less common among lactating than non-lactating women; however, the rate of conception is twice as great among the former than the latter, and the distribution of conception outcomes does not differ between the two groups. Menstrual regularity is not the norm in this population, even among those who are not currently breastfeeding. High altitude per se does not appear to influence menstrual cycling as both regularity and segment length are comparable to other populations, hence women indigenous to high altitude are suitable candidates for a wide variety of contraceptive choices. In addition, these findings suggest that studies of fecundability limited to non-lactating women may be biased towards those of relatively lower fecundity. © 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Owing to unique physiochemical and biological properties as well as the ability to be combined with a wide variety of materials for both biocompatibility and hydrophilia, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) is an excellent choice as a carrier. Loading Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) into biodegradable carrier for its good disinfection performance and high safety factors has attracted significantattention. Therefore, in this study, we used ClO2 as a model drug, and a sustained-ClO2-gas-release gel was developed from degradable materials, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and β-cyclodextrin (βCD), through a simple and benign crosslinking strategy. Notably, the gel had sustained-release property in a wide temperature range of 4–35 ℃ and released ClO2 gas effectively for more than 30 days. Furthermore, a loss factor was proposed based on the incomplete release of the drug in the sustained release process to a chieve a good fit with the gas diffusion process. A new diffusion model was designed based on the Korsmeyer–Peppas model, and an excellent fit was obtained. This sustained-ClO2-gas-release gel provides theoretical and technical guidance for the development of sustained-disinfectant-release agents for use in space and offers new insights into the sustained release model of skeleton-soluble hydrogels.

      " Abstract: The multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) improves the energy supply economy through a multi-energy coupling operation. However, due to faults or maintenance, outages may occur in the main grid, forcing the MEMG switch to the islanded mode, which heavily impacts the energy supply reliability. To solve this problem, a multi-objective stochastic optimization approach for planning the MEMG considering unscheduled islanded operation is proposed in this paper. This method aims to optimize the planning decision, improve the operation economy in the grid-connected mode and enhance the energy supply reliability in the islanded mode. A planning-operation co-optimization model is established with two objective functions: the minimum total planning cost and the minimum expected economic loss caused by islanded operation. The model incorporates equipment capacity allocation constraints, operation constraints in two operation modes and load curtailment constraints in the islanded mode. In addition to considering the uncertainties of load and renewable energy, the model of the uncertain islanded mode is established using four correlated random variables, and the scenario tree is used for islanded scenario generation. The adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to solve the multi-objective model and obtain an optimal and evenly distributed Pareto frontier. On this basis, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the final planning scheme. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which makes a trade-off between planning economy and energy supply reliability. © 2010-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The PCM Telemeter System described in this paper was designed and developed specifically for the Lunar Orbiter Spacecraft (LOS). Its functional capabilities are those of a good general-purpose PCM Telemeter. Reliability of the PCM System was the most important design consideration. The system reliability of Ps 0.986 for a 30-day mission was endeavored to be met through the use of Hi-Rel piece - parts qualified to existing Minuteman/Gemini/Apollo/LEM high reliability specifications. The Reliability Program was based on NPC 250-1. In operation, the PCM Telemeter accepts three types of input signals, (1) high level analog, (2) parallel digital (bilevel), and (3) serial digital data. The analog signals are multiplexed and encoded with an accuracy of 0.2% including over-all linearity of 0.1%. Digital data is interlaced into the output word format by the system as it is received. System timing is normally synchronized with an external clock. However, if the external clock fails, timing is automatically switched to an internal clock source and thus the PCM System will continue to function. The basic output bit rate for the PCM System is 50 bits per second. The PCM Telemeter supplies “read-in” pulses to other external equipment as timing commands for reading serial digital data into the PCM. The PCM also provides a 50 PPS shift pulse to an external 26-bit serial digital channel register. The PCM Telemeter can be divided, for purposes of explanation, into six subunits: ●Analog Multiplexer ● Analog-to-Digital Converter ●Digital Multiplexer ● Programmer •Output Shift Register & Formatter • Power Supply. The Analog Multiplexer time sequences 78 analog input channels in the 0 to 5 volt range using the coincidence of row-column commands to cause conduction of a channel gate. The analog gates themselves are implemented by use of a modified Bright switch configuration. Any single gate failure will cause, at most, the loss of six channels. This was achieved mainly through sequencing techniques. The PAM output from the analog multiplexer is fed directly into the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). Here, the analog signal is digitized into nine (8 bit code plus complement of the least significant bit) binary digits and presented to the Digital Multiplexer for insertion into the output format. Trade-off studies involving reliability, size, weight, power, and failure effects were used in the selection of a ramp coder over the next best choice, a successive approximation type of ADC. The ramp coder selected is unique in several ways. It uses the ramp generating capacitor as a sample and hold capacitor and as a result requires only one level detector. Also, a voltage controlled oscillator, adjusted during periodic correction cycles, is used to maintain the correct number of counts for a given precision input voltage. The Digital Multiplexer time sequences the 78binarily coded analog words, the 127 parallel digital channels and a 43 bit frame synchronization word for read-in to the output shift register. The Digital Multiplexer is implemented with a diode power strobed AND gate in a fail-safe configuration. Any single gate failure will cause, at most, the loss of one bit of digital information. Each digital channel is sampled once per minor frame. The Programmer provides all timing, synchronization, and command signals to control the traffic of the system. Included in the Programmer is a precision 50 CPS astable multivibrator used as the clock source should the external clock fail. The purpose of the Output Register and Formatter is to convert the parallel output from the Digital Multiplexer into serial data, provide read-in/read-out circuitry for interfacing equipment supplying serial data to the PCM, and to provide for the NRZ-M-1 serial data word train output of the PCM, To be consistent with the reliability goals, fail-safe circuitry was used at these interfaces. The LOS PCM Power Supply accepts an input DC voltage in the range of 21 to 33 VDC and derives all system voltages from it. It is a dc-dc converter with a feedback loop to provide the necessary regulation. An RFI filter and reverse voltage protection are incorporated in the design. A sync circuit is included to prevent power supply switching noise from causing errors in the analog channels. Usage of Hi-Rel components along with the designed features of the Power Supply allowed a reliability estimate for this critical unit to be 0.99907. The electronics of the LOS Hi-Rel PCM are packaged in the welded “cordwood” modular concept. Each module is potted in polyurethane foam and mounted on printed circuit cards and compressioned packaged into the mechanical housing. This provides a solid mass capable of withstanding the most severe environments. Typical amplification factors during vibration run as low as 3 and 4 with this packaging technique. An indication of the reliability achievement of the LOS Telemeter was shown when eleven out of eleven units delivered, passed all electrical, functional, and environmental tests without a single out of tolerance condition.

      " Abstract: In this paper, a robust parametric model of a brushless permanent magnet machine with fractional-slot concentrated windings, which was developed for automated design optimization is presented. A computationally efficient finite-element analysis method was employed to estimate the dq-axes inductances, the induced voltage and torque ripple waveforms, and losses of the machine. A method for minimum effort calculation of the torque angle corresponding to the maximum torque per ampere load condition was developed. A differential evolution algorithm was implemented for the global design optimization with two concurrent objectives of minimum losses and minimum material cost. An engineering decision process based on the Pareto-optimal front for 3,500 candidate designs is presented together with discussions on the tradeoffs between cost and performance. One optimal design was finally selected, prototyped and successfully tested. © 1972-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: To determine the outcome of heel and ankle reconstruction with distally-based sural island flap. Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: The study was carried out in Plastic Surgery Department, Chittagong Medical College Hospital, from January 2007 to April 2009. Methodology: Twenty two subjects with soft tissue defect of heel and ankle requiring coverage were included in the study. The flap was first outlined on the posterior aspect of leg at the junction of upper and middle-third. Having incision made over the designed flap and along the line of the fascial pedicle, the vessels and the nerve were ligated at the proximal margin and severed. The skin island was elevated with the deep fascia. The sub-cutaneous fascial pedicle was then raised, with a width of 2.5 cm to include the sural nerve and vessels. The recipient defect was covered after tunneling the island flap. The donor site was closed directly when the wound was less wide and with a split skin graft when the wound was large. Results were analyzed in terms of graft acceptance and complications determined as percentage frequencies. Results: Of the 22 patients, 15 had uneventful recovery with almost complete take of flaps. Although 5 patients showed marginal necrosis initially, they later on healed by secondary intention without requiring any secondary graft coverage. The rest two had a marked loss of flap in the peripheral part and required secondary graft coverage. Immediate venous congestion was commonly encountered which disappeared within a few days. There were no delayed complaints regarding sensation of the flaps. Conclusion: Distally-based sural island flap can be performed as a one-step procedure without sacrifice of any major artery. It is reliable, safe and should be the choice for reconstruction of ankle and heel defects.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Dynapenia is defined as the age-related loss of muscle strength, and plays a significant role in the loss of physical function and increased risk of disability among older individuals. The need for an early diagnosis supports the search for a biomarker that reflects muscle ‘weakening’. This has previously proven difficult due to patient heterogeneity at presentation and lack of understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to identify potential urinary biomarkers of dynapenia in patients undergoing potentially curative surgery for upper gastrointestinal cancer. Maximum isometric knee extensor strength (strain gauge) and maximum leg extensor power (Nottingham power rig) measurements were taken. Cut-off values for dynapenia were based on the Allied Dunbar national fitness survey. Values below the 5th percentile for the population matched for age and sex on the Allied Dunbar national fitness survey were used to stratify the cohort into dynapenic or normal. Urine samples taken at induction of anaesthesia were analysed by SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry using CM10 and IMAC30 chip-types to establish statistically significant m/z peak fingerprint patterns, followed by in-gel LC-MS/MS to identify molecular constituents. Statistical analysis of decision-tree calculations using Biomarker Pattern software resulted in models with sensitivities of 86 and 96%, specificities of 81 and 89%, and overall correctness of 84 and 93%, when applied to the entire cohort for power and strength measure-ment-based stratifications using the IMAC30 chip-type and the CM10 chip-type, respectively. The molecular identities of 10 peaks of interest were further investigated. After subtraction of potentially unrelated proteins, they were identified as fragments of Annexin A1, collagen α-1 (XV), perlecan and myotrophin. These results demonstrate that urinary screening can be used to define cancer-associated muscle weakness, and the identification of potential biomarkers could be invaluable in establishing a rapid test to measure and assess dynapenia in the clinical setting. © 2018, Spandidos Publications.

      " Abstract: The Arctic region is composed of unique marine and terrestrial ecosystems that provide a range of services to local and global populations. However, Arctic sea-ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, threatening many of these ecosystems and the services they provide. This short communication provides a preliminary assessment of the quantity, distribution and economic value of key ecosystem services as well as geological resources such as oil and minerals provided by Arctic ecosystems to beneficiaries in the Arctic region and globally. Using biophysical and economic data from existing studies, preliminary estimates indicate that the Arctic currently provides about 281 billion per year (in 2016 US) in terms of food, mineral extraction, oil production, tourism, hunting, existence values and climate regulation. However, given predictions of ice-free summers by 2037, many of the ecosystem services may be lost. We hope that this communication stimulates discussion among policy-makers regarding the value of ecosystem services and such geological resources as minerals and oil provided by the Arctic region, and the potential ecosystem losses resulting from Arctic melt, so as to motivate decisions vis a vis climate change mitigation before Arctic ice disappears completely. © 2017\u001b[0m :\n",

The clinical symptoms of single vessel CGI patients are postprandial and exercise-related pain, weight loss, and an abdominal bruit. The current diagnostic approach in patients suspected of single vessel CGI is gastrointestinal tonometry combined with radiological visualisation of the abdominal arteries to define possible arterial stenosis. Especially in single vessel abdominal artery stenosis, gastrointestinal tonometry plays a pivotal role in establishing the diagnosis CGI. First-choice treatment of single vessel CGI remains surgical revascularisation, especially in CACS.

      " Abstract: Players of real-time strategy (RTS) games are often annoyed by the inability of the game AI to select and move teams of units in a natural way. Units travel and battle separately, resulting in huge losses and the AI looking unintelligent, as can the choice of units sent to counteract the opponents. Players are affected as well as computer commanded factions because they cannot micromanage all team related issues. We suggest improving AI behavior by combining well-known computational intelligence techniques applied in an original way. Team composition for battling spatially distributed opponent groups is supported by a learning self-organizing map (SOM) that relies on an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to adapt it to the game. Different abilities of unit types are thus employed in a near-optimal way, reminiscent of human ad hoc decisions. Team movement is greatly enhanced by flocking and influence map-based path finding, leading to a more natural behavior by preserving individual motion types. The team decision to either attack or avoid a group of enemy units is easily parametrizable, incorporating team characteristics from fearful to daredevil. We demonstrate that these two approaches work well separately, but also that they go together naturally, thereby leading to an improved and flexible group behavior. © 2010 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: This research develops a framework for assessing international trade regimes which could be used to address global cybersecurity challenges based on the corresponding costs of implementation and their distribution. Trade regimes, such as export controls, tariffs, investment restrictions and localization requirements, have disparate effects on foreign and domestic producers and consumers. Design/methodology/approach: These trade regimes and their effects are explored through a literature review and conceptual framework. A case study then assesses trends in the use of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Findings: CFIUS investment restrictions have justified blocking specific Chinese acquisitions of American companies, at least partially, on cybersecurity grounds using a targeted and evidence-based approach. Because of its targeted effect, CFIUS is the least likely of these trade regimes to block legitimate international trade. Restrictions on international trade, without sufficient cause, produce dead weight loss under the theory of comparative advantage. Originality/value: These costs should be accounted for in any policy-based decision, particularly as policy entrepreneurs increasingly push for embedding cybersecurity reforms into these trade regimes.

      " Abstract: Background: The burden of disease due to S. pneumoniae (pneumococcus), particularly pneumonia, remains high despite the widespread use of vaccines. Drug resistant strains complicate clinical treatment and may increase costs. We estimated the annual burden and incremental costs attributable to antibiotic resistance in pneumococcal pneumonia.Methods: We derived estimates of healthcare utilization and cost (in 2012 dollars) attributable to penicillin, erythromycin and fluoroquinolone resistance by taking the estimate of disease burden from a previously described decision tree model of pneumococcal pneumonia in the U.S. We analyzed model outputs assuming only the existence of susceptible strains and calculating the resulting differences in cost and utilization. We modeled the cost of resistance from delayed resolution of illness and the resulting additional health services.Results: Our model estimated that non-susceptibility to penicillin, erythromycin and fluoroquinolones directly caused 32,398 additional outpatient visits and 19,336 hospitalizations for pneumococcal pneumonia. The incremental cost of antibiotic resistance was estimated to account for 4% () of direct medical costs and 5% ($233 million) of total costs including work and productivity loss. Most of the incremental medical cost (82 million) was related to hospitalizations resulting from erythromycin non-susceptibility. Among patients under age 18 years, erythromycin non-susceptibility was estimated to cause 17% of hospitalizations for pneumonia and 38 million in costs, or 39% of pneumococcal pneumonia costs attributable to resistance.Conclusions: We estimate that antibiotic resistance in pneumococcal pneumonia leads to substantial healthcare utilization and cost, with more than one-third driven by macrolide resistance in children. With 5% of total pneumococcal costs directly attributable to resistance, strategies to reduce antibiotic resistance or improve antibiotic selection could lead to substantial savings. © 2014 Reynolds et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This article reviews the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) in model selection and the appraisal of psychological theory. The focus is on latent variable models, given their growing use in theory testing and construction. Theoretical statistical results in regression are discussed, and more important issues are illustrated with novel simulations involving latent variable models including factor analysis, latent profile analysis, and factor mixture models. Asymptotically, the BIC is consistent, in that it will select the true model if, among other assumptions, the true model is among the candidate models considered. The AIC is not consistent under these circumstances. When the true model is not in the candidate model set the AIC is efficient, in that it will asymptotically choose whichever model minimizes the mean squared error of prediction/estimation. The BIC is not efficient under these circumstances. Unlike the BIC, the AIC also has a minimax property, in that it can minimize the maximum possible risk in finite sample sizes. In sum, the AIC and BIC have quite different properties that require different assumptions, and applied researchers and methodologists alike will benefit from improved understanding of the asymptotic and finite-sample behavior of these criteria. The ultimate decision to use the AIC or BIC depends on many factors, including the loss function employed, the study's methodological design, the substantive research question, and the notion of a true model and its applicability to the study at hand. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

A retrospective review of the clinical records was performed, and demographic, clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic data were collected. Six patients were females (37%), and the mean age was 62 years. Postprandial pain was present in all the cases, whereas sitophobia and weight loss were detected in 87 per cent of them. Eight patients were treated with open surgery; no perioperative deaths or relevant complications occurred. One patient had a restenosis of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery 10 months after surgery. No deaths or relevant complications occurred in the remaining patients, who underwent an endovascular procedure. One patient presented a restenosis distal to the vascular stent, whereas two patients died due to comorbidities.

      " Abstract: Small run-of-river hydropower may significantly contribute towards meeting global renewable energy targets. However, exploitation of river flows for energy production triggers environmental impacts and conflicts among stakeholders, thereby requiring optimal water resources allocation strategies. The variety of interests at stake demands instruments to quantitatively assess manifold effects of water management choices. In this work, analytic tools to guide design of run-of-river power plants when incommensurable objectives must be jointly maximized are presented. The approach is grounded on the concept of Paretian efficiency and applied to a hypothetical case study in Scotland, where energy production could compete with regionally relevant ecosystem services. We found that a multi-objective design complying with predefined environmental regulation entails significant economic losses without safeguarding ecological functions. Conversely, if the environmental flow is regarded as a decision variable subject to minimum lawful values, economically appealing and ecologically effective plant configurations emerge. Our findings suggest the existence of broadly valid alternative strategies for designing small run-of-river hydropower while preserving ecological functions, associated to small or large plant capacities. Local hydrologic conditions and target ecosystem services determine the most effective strategy for specific case studies. The analysis indicates that larger power plants are sometimes the most effective way to preserve ecosystems services through economically viable projects. Therefore, renewable energy policy should avoid incentive schemes that penalize a priori larger installations. The approach offers an objective basis to identify effective hydropower design, management and policies when additional ecosystems services are considered, thus supporting a sustainable intensification of run-of-river energy production. © 2020 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is effective in decreasing rejection and graft loss in renal transplant patients. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) was designed to reduce MMF gastrointestinal (GI) effects. Dose manipulations in MMF/EC-MPS produce GI tolerability, increasing the risk of rejection. Significant differences in tolerance of MMF/EC-MPS may have economic influence in transplant efficacy outcomes. Herein, we performed a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of acute rejection incidence and interventions in GI-intolerant patients using MMF/EC-MPS. Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed through a decision tree model with a 1-year time horizon estimating costs and effectiveness of MMF and EC-MPS in renal transplant patients with GI intolerance. The costs and use of resources (US dollars; USD) were from payer perspective (Mexican Social Security). Primary health outcomes were mean cost of acute rejection and GI adverse events treatment. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was generated to test robustness of the model. Results Calculated incidence of MMF GI intolerance was 44%, and calculated rejection incidence for MMF was 24.05%. Calculated incidence of EC-MPS GI intolerance was 29%, and calculated rejection incidence for EC-MPS was 20.1% Total cost of MMF with GI intolerance during 1-year period plus cost of treating one rejection sums $752,107.25 USD. Total cost of EC-MPS with GI intolerance plus cost of treating one rejection sums $638,018.97 USD.

Data were collected on all claimants undergoing FCE at Alberta's workers' compensation rehabilitation facility. Twenty-three clinicians who were trained and experienced with FCE were randomized to either an intervention or control group. The intervention group was trained to conduct short-form FCE and used this protocol through the trial's duration, while the control group continued standard FCE procedures. Data on subject characteristics, administrative outcomes (days to suspension of time loss benefits, days to claim closure, and future recurrence) and claimant satisfaction were extracted from the WCB-Alberta computer databases. Clinicians logged time taken to complete assessments. Analysis included examining differences between groups using independent samples t tests, Cox and logistic regression. Results: Subjects included 372 claimants of whom 173 were tested with short-form FCE. Subjects were predominantly employed (64%) males (69%) with chronic musculoskeletal conditions (median duration 252 days). Administrative recovery outcomes were similar between groups as were claimant satisfaction ratings. No statistically significant or clinically relevant differences were observed on these outcomes between groups. A 43% reduction in functional assessment time was seen. Conclusion: A short-form FCE appears to reduce time of assessment while not affecting recovery outcomes when compared to standard FCE administration. Such a protocol may be an efficient option for therapists performing fitness-for-work assessments. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We present an integrated methodology for the optimal management of nitrate contamination of ground water combining environmental assessment and economic cost evaluation through multi-criteria decision analysis. The proposed methodology incorporates an integrated physical modeling framework accounting for on-ground nitrogen loading and losses, soil nitrogen dynamics, and fate and transport of nitrate in ground water to compute the sustainable on-ground nitrogen loading such that the maximum contaminant level is not violated. A number of protection alternatives to stipulate the predicted sustainable on-ground nitrogen loading are evaluated using the decision analysis that employs the importance order of criteria approach for ranking and selection of the protection alternatives. The methodology was successfully demonstrated for the Sumas-Blaine aquifer in Washington State. The results showed the importance of using this integrated approach which predicts the sustainable on-ground nitrogen loadings and provides an insight into the economic consequences generated in satisfying the environmental constraints. The results also show that the proposed decision analysis framework, within certain limitations, is effective when selecting alternatives with competing demands. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

      " Abstract: The making of statistical inferences in distributional form is conceptionally complicated because the epistemic ‘probabilities’ assigned are mixtures of fact and fiction. In this respect they are essentially different from ‘physical’ or ‘frequency‐theoretic’ probabilities. The distributional form is so attractive and useful, however, that it should be pursued. Our approach is In line with Walds theory of statistical decision functions and with Lehmann's books about hypothesis testing and point estimation: loss functions are defined, risk functions are studied, unbiasedness and equivariance restrictions are made, etc. A central theme is that the loss function should be ‘proper’. This fundamental concept has been explored by meteorologists, psychometrists, Bayesian statisticians, and others. The paper should be regarded as an attempt to reconcile various schools of statisticians. By accepting what we regard 88 good and useful in the various approaches we are trying to develop a nondogmatic approach. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper was prompted by my concern that many major institutions throughout the country are not really manageable as they are currently constituted. In some it is extremely problematic whether staffing above the level needed to prevent external breaches of security is really serving any purpose. The goal of protecting inmates from each other somehow got lost in the scramble of staff to protect themselves. I've tried to outline the conditions which have brought this about. Traditional control mechanisms for both inmates and staff have been irreparably damaged. Based on mutual corruption and capriousness, the conditions which sustain it have slowly faded away. Certain demographic changes have altered the inmate “mix” producing fewer old time convicts willing to accommodate staff needs for control while procedural guarantees have limited the ability to control staff and inmates on the basis of fealty or arbitrariness. The brief period of influence by politicized prisoners seems now to have given way to competing prison gangs. Some new basis of accommodation must be found. I've described three projects which seem to demonstrate the value of sharing power with both inmates and line staff in the future task of prison management. This paper argues that the most promising direction is a more participative organization with redistribution of decision making authority. © 1977, Sage Publications.

      " Abstract: In this paper, a dual‐layer grid comprehensive resource optimizing allocation model is proposed, which considers power quality controlling and load optimization scheduling under large‐scale application of distributed electric heating. The upper‐layer planning aims to minimize the active power loss of the distribution network, the minimum voltage deviation, and the minimum investment cost of the power quality control device. The capacity configuration of the management device and the number and location of the commutation switch configuration were determined. The lower layer is load optimization scheduling, with the minimum number of action switches and the minimum three‐phase imbalance as the planning goals, and the decision variable is the state of the commutation switch. By co‐simulation through Matlab and OpenDSS, the improved particle swarm algorithm and genetic algorithm are used for multi‐objective optimization and the solution. In this way, the capacity configuration of reactive power compensation and active filter, as well as the installation position and switch state of the commutation switch are optimized and managed. Finally, taking the rural low‐voltage distribution network in the Tongzhou District as an example, simulations considering the variation in the distributed electric heating penetration rate in the range of 20–80% are carried out. The calculation example results show that the proposed algorithm is effective, can effectively improve the power factor, reduces the harmonic content of the distribution network and the three‐phase unbalance, and significantly improves the distribution network voltage. © 2022 by the authors.

      " Abstract: Purpose: The complexity and severity of rare genetic conditions pose substantial burden to families. While the importance of spillovers on carers’ health in resource allocation decisions is increasingly recognised, there is significant lack of empirical evidence in the context of rare diseases. The objective of this study was to estimate the health spillovers of paediatric rare genetic conditions on parents. Methods: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) data from children with rare genetic conditions (genetic kidney diseases, mitochondrial diseases, epileptic encephalopathies, brain malformations) and their parents were collected using the CHU9D and SF-12 measures, respectively. We used two approaches to estimate parental health spillovers. To quantify the ‘absolute health spillover’, we matched our parent cohort to the Australian general population. To quantify the ‘relative health spillover’, regression models were applied using the cohort data. Results: Parents of affected children had significantly lower HRQoL compared to matched parents in the general public (− 0.06; 95% CIs − 0.08, − 0.04). Multivariable regression demonstrated a positive association between parental and child health. The mean magnitude of HRQoL loss in parents was estimated to be 33% of the HRQoL loss observed in children (95% CIs 21%, 46%). Conclusion: Paediatric rare genetic conditions appear to be associated with substantial parental health spillovers. This highlights the importance of including health effects on family members and caregivers into economic evaluation of genomic technologies and personalised medicine. Overlooking spillover effects may undervalue the benefits of diagnosis and management in this context. This study also expands the knowledge of family spillover to the rare disease spectrum. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We reviewed our series of surgeries for paediatric cholesteatoma to assess outcomes and functional results considering the extension of disease and surgical techniques. Between January 2003 and December 2009, 36 patients (range 6-14 years) were operated on for cholesteatoma. We considered the sites involved by the cholesteatoma (mastoid, antrum, attic, middle ear, Eustachian tube), surgical techniques used (intact canal wall, canal wall down) and how our habits changed over the years; moreover, we evaluated ossicular chain conditions and how we managed the ossiculoplasty. As outcomes, we considered the percentage of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma for each technique and hearing function (air bone gap closure, high frequencies bone conduction hearing loss) at follow-up. Intact canal wall was performed in 20 patients and canal wall down in 13 patients, in 9 as first surgery. In both groups, we observed improvement of the air bone gap; in the intact canal wall group, a residual cholesteatoma was observed in 6 patients whereas, during follow-up, 2 patients who underwent a canal wall down showed a recurrent cholesteatoma that was treated in an outpatient setting. Eradication of cholesteatoma and restoration of hearing function in paediatric patients present unique surgical challenges. Our experience shows an increased choice of intact canal wall over the years. Therefore, it is important for the surgeon to counsel parents about the probable need for multiple surgeries, especially if an intact canal wall mastoidectomy is performed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Main processes governing the plant-soil interactions in adult olive (Olea europaea L.) trees under fertigation were studied to better understand the response of the trees to this agricultural practice widely used in new olive orchards. Our final objective was to obtain soundly based scientific evidences for a rational choice of the fertilizer dose. Measurements were made in a 'Manzanilla de Sevilla' olive orchard in which 200 g N, 400 g N and 600 g N per tree and irrigation period (T200, T400 and T600, respectively) of a 4N-1P-3K fertilizer were applied by fertigation for 5 years (1999-2003); a control treatment (unfertilized) was also established. Four years after the start of the experiment mean values of soil P and K concentrations were greater in the fertigation treatments than in the control. For K, concentrations increased with fertilizer dose. The profile of NO3-N, P and K concentrations within the irrigation wetted zone was studied in 2003; in the top soil layer, the concentrations of the three elements increased with fertilizer dose, generally showing linear responses to the different doses; in deeper soil layers, concentrations also increased with fertigation, but to a lesser extent; the concentrations of NO3-N, P and K recorded at 0.8-0.9 m depth in the soil of T600, together with observations of root distribution, were enough to suggest leaching losses and possible groundwater contamination. As a consequence of the higher soil nutrient availability, leaf N, P and K increased generally with dose. Leaf N deficiencies and low, but not deficient, leaf K levels were found in control trees in 2002 and 2003, as well as in T200 trees in 2003. Differences between treatments in shoot length, trunk circumference and canopy volume were not significant, for any studied year. Nevertheless, between February 1999 and November 2003 there was a significant increase in canopy volume with fertilizer dose. In 2003, fruit yield increased with fertilizer dose, as a consequence of an increase both in fruit number and weight. Cumulative yield for the experimental period also increased with fertilizer dose. These results are further evidence to confirm previous research made with the same experimental set-up: T400 for oil quality and T600 for table olive quality seem to be the most appropriate treatments, although there is a risk for leaching losses and the possibility of groundwater contamination with T600. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This article links the consequences of the Great Recession on protest and electoral politics. It innovates by combining the literature on economic voting with social movement research and by presenting the first integrated, large-scale empirical analysis of protest mobilisation and electoral outcomes in Europe. The economic voting literature offers important insights on how and under what conditions economic crises play out in the short-run. However, it tends to ignore the closely connected dynamics of opposition in the two arenas and the role of protests in politicising economic grievances. More specifically, it is argued that economic protests act as a ‘signalling mechanism’ by attributing blame to decision makers and by highlighting the political dimension of deteriorating economic conditions. Ultimately, massive protest mobilisation should, thus, amplify the impact of economic hardship on the electoral losses of incumbents and mainstream parties more generally. The empirical analysis to study this relationship relies on an original semi-automated protest event dataset combined with an updated dataset of electoral outcomes in 30 European countries from 2000 to 2015. The results indicate that the dynamics of economic protests and electoral punishment are closely related and point to a destabilisation of European party systems during the Great Recession. © 2019 European Consortium for Political Research\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Performance evaluations of health services providers burgeons. Simi-larly, analyzing spatially related health information, ranking teachers and schools, and identification of differentially expressed genes are increasing in prevalence and importance. Goals include valid and efficient ranking of units for profiling and league tables, identification of excellent and poor performers, the most differentially expressed genes, and determining \"exceedances\" (how many and which unit-specific true parameters exceed a threshold). These data and inferential goals require a hierarchical, Bayesian model that accounts for nesting relations and identifies both population values and random effects for unit-specific parameters. Furthermore, the Bayesian approach coupled with optimizing a loss function provides a framework for computing non-standard inferences such as ranks and histograms. Estimated ranks that minimize Squared Error Loss (SEL) between the true and estimated ranks have been investigated. The posterior mean ranks minimize SEL and are \"general purpose,\" relevant to a broad spectrum of ranking goals. However, other loss functions and optimizing ranks that are tuned to application-specific goals require identification and evaluation. For example, when the goal is to identify the relatively good (e.g., in the upper 10%) or relatively poor performers, a loss function that penalizes classification errors produces estimates that mini-mize the error rate. We construct loss functions that address this and other goals, developing a unified framework that facilitates generating candidate estimates, comparing approaches and producing data analytic performance summaries. We compare performance for a fully parametric, hierarchical model with Gaussian sampling distribution under Gaussian and a mixture of Gaussians prior distribu-tions. We illustrate approaches via analysis of standardized mortality ratio data from the United States Renal Data System. Results show that SEL-optimal ranks perform well over a broad class of loss functions but can be improved upon when classifying units above or below a per-centile cut-point. Importantly, even optimal rank estimates can perform poorly in many real-world settings; therefore, data-analytic performance summaries should always be reported. © 2006 International Society for Bayesian Analysis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper we study the capacity investment decision for make-to-order manufacturing firms that utilize a fixed capacity, operate in a stochastic, stationary market, and can influence their demand rate by increasing or decreasing their sales effort. We consider manufacturing situations that differ in sales contribution, in market elasticity to sales effort, work-in-process costs, and demand sensitivity to lead time. If demand is insensitive to lead time we find that for situations with a low sales contribution and high work-in-process costs (for example the manufacturing of capacity equipment that is at the end of the innovative life cycle, such as food processing machines and textile printing machines), using a dynamic demand rate policy can bring substantial improvements in profit. Moreover, when using the optimal demand rate policy, the profit is quite insensitive to the initial capacity investment. If demand is sensitive to lead time, using a dynamic demand rate policy brings substantial increases in profit in all situations considered. The profit again is quite insensitive to the initial capacity investment. Consequently, without much loss in profit, for all cases the capacity investment decision can be based on the stochastic model with stationary demand, neglecting the possibility of influencing the demand rate. However, the profit that results from this investment, and the return-on-investment, should be determined from a model that includes the optimal demand rate policy, since the stationary stochastic model can significantly underestimate the profit and could lead to the abandonment of the investment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

      " Abstract: Start-up STPs have a central initiative controlling the decision-making. In early maturity, better decision-making is required and decisions are best taken with the input of optimally two on-cluster firms; this ambidextrous situation is superior under all circumstances. Where poor-fit innovations abound and where the STP has been unable to attract large firms, retaining a hierarchical decision process is most helpful, even when the quality of decision-making is poor. This developmental trajectory will lead to market failure as size, and the seriousness of the concomitant potential losses, increases. With time, off-cluster firms move outward, inhabiting a band 4–7 km from the STP; their size remains modest and their innovation output is low. On-cluster firms are resilient to externalities; their innovation output is large and strongly correlated with social/networking expenditure.

      " Abstract: A fast mode decision algorithm is proposed to reduce the computation complexity of adaptive inter layer prediction method, which is a motion estimation algorithm for video compression in scalable video coding (SVC) encoder systems. SVC is standard as an extension of H.264/AVC to provide multimedia services within variable transport environments and across various terminal systems. SVC supports an adaptive inter mode prediction, which includes not only the temporal prediction modes with varying block sizes but also inter layer prediction modes based on correlation between the lower layer information and the current layer. To achieve high coding efficiency, a rate distortion optimization technique is employed to select the best coding mode and reference frame for each MB. As a result, the performance gains of SVC come with increased computational complexity. To overcome this problem, we propose fast mode decision based on coded block pattern (CBP) of 16×16 mode and reference block of best CBP. The experimental results in SVC with combined scalability structure show that the proposed algorithm achieves up to an average 61.65% speed up factor in the encoding time with a negligible bit increment and a minimal image quality loss. In addition, experimental results in spatial and quality scalability show that the computational complexity has been reduced about 55.32% and 52.69%, respectively. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).\u001b[0m :\n",

Polymers offer flexibility, low cost fabrication and connection, high transparency in the visible and near-infrared spectra, and versatility in structure, properties, and grades for task specific integration such as local-area-network applications. Halogenated polymers in particular show negligible transmission losses in the range desired and fluoropolymers represent the lowest loss examples of organic polymers to date. However, commercial perfluoropolymers in general are limited by poor processability, non-trivial refractive index matching, and they typically do not exhibit the thermal and thermomechanical stability required for some commercial processes and extreme environment in-use applications. Our strategy has focused on the thermal cyclopolymerization of trifunctional and bifunctional aryl trifluorovinyl ether monomers to perfluorocyclobutane (PFCB) copolymers. PFCB polymers and copolymers enjoy a unique combination of properties well suited for optical applications such as high temperature stability, precisely controlled refractive index, low moisture absorption, excellent melt and solution processability, a high thermooptic coefficient, and low transmission loss at 1300 and 1550 nm. Copolymerization reactions offer tailored thermal and optical properties by simple choice of comonomer. PFCB polymers can be solution or melt microfabricated via standard methods and can also be processed by soft-lithography techniques.

The proposed expressions are founded in classical hydraulics. They are more accurate than predictions in irrigation practice and are easier to handle than the simulation models frequently proposed to irrigation technicians. Unit design and irrigation decision making and evaluation can thus be furthered. An example for the application of the proposed expressions is presented. First, lateral and submain diameters are determined for different shapes of irrigation units to achieve a given water application uniformity. The irrigation time to supply the desired irrigation depth is then calculated. Results are finally compared with values obtained by simulations that take into account hydraulic and manufacture variations in the unit.

      " Abstract: Background: Intervertebral disc degeneration is a common condition with few inexpensive and effective modes of treatment, but current investigations seek to clarify the underlying process and offer new treatment options. It will be important for physicians to understand the molecular basis for the pathology and how it translates to developing clinical treatments for disc degeneration. In this review, we sought to summarize for clinicians what is known about the molecular processes that causes disc degeneration.; Results: A healthy disc requires maintenance of a homeostatic environment, and when disrupted, a catabolic cascade of events occurs on a molecular level resulting in upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, increased degradative enzymes, and a loss of matrix proteins. This promotes degenerative changes and occasional neurovascular ingrowth potentially contributing to the development of pain. Research demonstrates the molecular changes underlying the harmful effects of aging, smoking, and obesity seen clinically while demonstrating the variable influence of exercise. Finally, oral medications, supplements, biologic treatments, gene therapy, and stem cells hold great promise but require cautious application until their safety profiles are better outlined.; Conclusions: Intervertebral disc degeneration occurs where there is a loss of homeostatic balance with a predominantly catabolic metabolic profile. A basic understanding of the molecular changes occurring in the degenerating disc is important for practicing clinicians because it may help them to inform patients to alter lifestyle choices, identify beneficial or harmful supplements, or offer new biologic, genetic, or stem cell therapies. © 2014, The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons®.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: A considerable disease period often precedes initiation of a biologic in patients with psoriasis. Little is known about this important period in patients’ lives. Evaluation of this ‘journey’ can reveal important insights and opportunities for physicians and healthcare decision makers. Objectives: (i) To describe patient and treatment characteristics until the start of biologic treatment in patients with severe psoriasis, (ii) to assess shifts in early (2005–2009) versus established (2010–2015) biologics prescription periods, (iii) to assess changes in hospital/day care admissions before vs. after starting biologics. Methods: Explorative, retrospective study on the treatment characteristics of the disease period until first biologic, presented with descriptive statistics of patients included in the BioCAPTURE registry. Journeys of 2005–2009 and 2010–2015 were compared with statistical tests to identify important shifts. Results: Median TUS (time until conventional systemic) was 11.0 years and median TUB (time until biologic) was 18.9 years for all patients treated from 2005 to 2015. Most patients received three different conventional antipsoriatic systemic therapies. We noticed a small trend towards a shorter journey (TUB) with only two conventional systemic agents instead of three before initiating a biologic in later years (2010–2015, vs. 2005–2009). We also noticed a significant decrease in (day care) admissions comparing the two years before, versus the first two years after the start of a biologic treatment (17.7 vs. 8.6 admissions/100 follow-up years, P < 0.001). Cyclosporine, intensive topical treatment (dithranol), retinoids and PUVA therapy lost popularity in recent years. Conclusion: The ‘journey’ of patients with psoriasis towards a biologic is still long and characterized by many different treatments. Shifts towards fewer conventional drugs before biologic initiation and a clear decrease in hospital and day care admissions before vs. after a biologic are seen. Improvement of this journey, especially in young or recently diagnosed patients, can decrease negative influences on patients’ lives and reduce societal impact. © 2017 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Maximum-loss (Max-loss) was recently introduced as a valuation functional in the context of systematic stress testing. The basic idea is to value a (financial) random variable by its worst case expectation, where the most unfavourable probability measure - the 'worst case distribution' - lies within a given Kullback-Leibler radius around a previously estimated distribution. The article gives an overview of the properties of this measure and analyses relations to other risk and acceptability measures and to the well-known Esscher pricing principle, used in insurance mathematics and option pricing. The main part of the article focuses then on optimal decision-making - in particular related to portfolio optimization - with Max-loss as the objective function to be minimized. A simple algorithm for dealing with the resulting saddle point problem is introduced and analysed. The authors 2011.

      " Abstract: Microbiological agents, such as bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungi, degrade cellulose. The most severe deterioration in indoor environments is primarily caused by cellulolytic fungi, resulting in loss of fiber strength and actual material failure. Other microbial spoilage can occur as a result of the permanent staining from pigmentation and mycelial penetration by both cellulolytic and non-cellulolytic fungi, the latter using food sources ranging from starch sizing to surface dirt, and oils. Much has been written concerning biocidal testing against these microfungal agents from an industrial point of view; less from a conservation standpoint. This paper submits a limited review of current literature (c. 25 years) focusing on the information and its relevance for the conservator. The following topics related to cellulosic deterioration by fungal microbes are covered; 1. current theories about the mechanism of cellulolytic attack; 2. biocides which may be employed in fungal control; and 3. choice of environmental conditions as a means of static control of fungal biodegradative agents.

This paper shows an extremely useful technique to work with incomplete decision tables using a block of an attribute-value pair. Incomplete decision tables are described by characteristic relations in the same way complete decision tables are described by indiscernibility relations. These characteristic relations are conveniently determined by blocks of attribute-value pairs. Three different kinds of lower and upper approximations for incomplete decision tables may be easily computed from characteristic relations. All three definitions are reduced to the same definition of the indiscernibility relation when the decision table is complete. This paper shows how to induce certain and possible rules for incomplete decision tables using MLEM2, an outgrow of the rule induction algorithm LEM2, again, using blocks of attribute-value pairs.

      " Abstract: This study evaluates the importance of overflow areas to the biological productivity of a bottomland hardwood swamp in the Henderson Lake area of the Atchafalaya Basin, Louisiana. Adult fishes, young-of-year Largemouth bass, crawfish, and zooplankton were monitored through a one year water cycle. Data from these collections were analyzed along with selected physical/chemical data to determine the extent that flooded woods areas of the swamp were utilized by the aquatic biota. The flooded woods habitat was the primary area utilized by fish and crawfish for spawning and as a nursery ground. Large concentrations of zooplankton and crawfish were available as a food resource for young-of-year and adult fish at the ephemeral edge habitat. Because of fluctuating water levels, this moving edge represented a large areal portion of the basin, suggesting the importance of flooded woods habitat to the aquatic biota. It is suggested that artificial reduction in the extent or duration of flooding of woods habitats will ultimately adversely affect the fishery and crawfish industries. Future management decisions regarding the disposition of Louisiana wetlands should be based upon careful consideration of the potential loss of these fisheries, and this loss weighted against the advantages of swamp drainage or alteration in flooding regimes. © 1983 Society of Wetland Scientists.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Almost a century ago, Leo Szilárd replaced Maxwell’s ‘demon’ by machinery. The resulting information engine concept laid the foundation for studying the physical nature of information. Szilárd reduced the demon’s role to mapping an observable onto a work extraction protocol, thereby creating and utilizing a meta-stable memory. While Szilárd demonstrated that this map can be implemented mechanistically, it was not chosen automatically by the demon, or ‘observer’, but rather given a priori. This choice implements the demon’s intelligence. In Szilárd’s original setup, the choice is trivial, but we show here that nontrivial data representations emerge for generalized, partially observable Szilárd engines. Partial observability is pervasive in real world systems with limited sensor types and information acquisition bandwidths. Generalized information engines may run work extraction at a higher temperature than memory formation, which enables the combined treatment of heat- and information engines. To date, Szilárd’s (fully observable) information engine still serves as a canonical example. Implications of partial observability are under-explored, despite their ubiquitous nature. We provide here the first physical characterization of observer memories that result in minimal engine dissipation. We introduce a new canonical model, simple yet physically rich: a minor change to Szilárd’s engine—inserting the divider at an angle—results in partially observable engines. We demonstrate how the demon’s intelligence can be automated. For each angle and for each temperature ratio, an optimal memory is found algorithmically, enabling the engine to run with minimal dissipation. While naive coarse graining is sufficient for the special case of full observability, in general, minimally dissipative observers use probabilistic memories. We propose a simple model for an implementation of these memories, and construct a nontrivial physical codebook. We characterize the performance of engines with minimally dissipative memories, and compare their quality to that of engines using an optimized coarse graining of the observable. © 2022 The Author(s).

      " Abstract: Background: Rapid molecular methods such as the line probe assay (LPA) and Xpert® MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) have been recommended by the World Health Organization for drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) diagnosis. We conducted an interventional trial in DR-TB reference centers in Brazil to evaluate the impact of the use of LPA and Xpert. Methods: Patients with DR-TB were eligible if their drug susceptibility testing results were available to the treating physician at the time of consultation. The standard reference MGIT™ 960 was compared with Xpert (arm 1) and LPA (arm 2). Effectiveness was considered as the start of the appropriate TB regimen that matched drug susceptibility testing (DST) and the proportions of culture conversion and favorable treatment outcomes after 6 months. Results: A higher rate of empirical treatment was observed with MGIT alone than with the Xpert assay (97.0% vs. 45.0%) and LPA (98.2% vs. 67.5%). Patients started appropriate TB treatment more quickly than those in the MGIT group (median 15.0 vs. 40.5 days; p<0.01) in arm 1. Compared to the MGIT group, culture conversion after 6 months was higher for Xpert in arm 1 (90.9% vs. 79.3%, p=0.39) and LPA in arm 2 (80.0% vs. 83.0%, p=0.81). Conclusions: In the Xpert arm, there was a significant reduction in days to the start of appropriate anti-TB treatment and a trend towards greater culture conversion in the sixth month. © 2022, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

      " Abstract: Background. Many medical decisions involve an implied choice between alternative survival curves, typically with differing quality of life. Common preference assessment methods neglect this structure, creating some risk of distortions. Methods. Survival curve quality-of-life assessments (SQLA) were developed fromGompertz survival curves fitting the general population's survival. An algorithm was developed to generate relative discount rate-utility (DRU) functions from a standard survival curve and health state and an equally attractive alternative curve and state. A least means squared distance algorithm was developed to describe how nearly 3 or more DRU functions intersect. These techniques were implemented in a program called X-Trade and tested. Results. SQLA scenarios can portray realistic treatment choices. A side effect scenario portrays one prototypical choice, to extend life while experiencing some loss, such as an amputation. A risky treatment scenario portrays procedures with an initial mortality risk. A time trade scenario mimics conventional time tradeoffs. Each SQLA scenario yields DRU functions with distinctive shapes, such as sigmoid curves or vertical lines. One SQLA can imply a discount rate or utility if the other value is known and both values are temporally stable. Two SQLA exercises imply a unique discount rate and utility if the inferred DRU functions intersect. Three or more SQLA results can quantify uncertainty or inconsistency in discount rate and utility estimates. Pilot studies suggested that many subjects could learn to interpret survival curves and do SQLA. Limitations. SQLA confuse some people. Compared with SQLA, standard gambles quantify very low utilities more easily, and time tradeoffs are simpler for high utilities. When discount rates approach zero, time tradeoffs are as informative and easier to do than SQLA. Conclusions. SQLA may complement conventional utility assessment methods. © The Author(s) 2014.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study explores the influence of lifestyle, sociodemographics and utilization of dental services on the dentition status of an older urban Malaysian population. Methods A total of 1210 participants 60 years and above, representing the three main ethnic groups were recruited from a larger cohort study. Weighted factors valued for comparison included socio demographics and health status. Knowledge of and attitude and behaviour towards personal oral health were also assessed. Dentition status, adapted from WHO oral health guidelines, was the dependent variable investigated. Data were analysed using descriptive chi square test and multivariate binary logistic regression. Results Overall, 1187 respondents completed the study. The dentition status and oral health related knowledge, attitude and behaviour varied between the three ethnic groups. The Chinese were significantly less likely to have ≥13 missing teeth (OR = 0.698, 95% CI: 0.521-0.937) and ≥1 decayed teeth (0.653; 0.519-0.932) compared to the Malays, while the Indians were significantly less likely than the Malays to have ≥1 decayed teeth (0.695; 0.519-0.932) and ≥2 filled teeth (0.781; 0.540-1.128).

Despite the recognition of obesity in young people as a key health issue, there is limited evidence to inform health professionals regarding the most appropriate treatment options. The Eat Smart study aims to contribute to the knowledge base of effective dietary strategies for the clinical management of the obese adolescent and examine the cardiometablic effects of a reduced carbohydrate diet versus a low fat diet. Methods and design. Eat Smart is a randomised controlled trial and aims to recruit 100 adolescents over a 2 1/2 year period. Families will be invited to participate following referral by their health professional who has recommended weight management. Participants will be overweight as defined by a body mass index (BMI) greater than the 90th percentile, using CDC 2000 growth charts. An accredited 6-week psychological life skills program 'FRIENDS for Life', which is designed to provide behaviour change and coping skills will be undertaken prior to volunteers being randomised to group. The intervention arms include a structured reduced carbohydrate or a structured low fat dietary program based on an individualised energy prescription. The intervention will involve a series of dietetic appointments over 24 weeks. The control group will commence the dietary program of their choice after a 12 week period. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 24. The primary outcome measure will be change in BMI z-score. A range of secondary outcome measures including body composition, lipid fractions, inflammatory markers, social and psychological measures will be measured. Discussion. The chronic and difficult nature of treating the obese adolescent is increasingly recognised by clinicians and has highlighted the need for research aimed at providing effective intervention strategies, particularly for use in the tertiary setting. A structured reduced carbohydrate approach may provide a dietary pattern that some families will find more sustainable and effective than the conventional low fat dietary approach currently advocated. This study aims to investigate the acceptability and effectiveness of a structured reduced dietary carbohydrate intervention and will compare the outcomes of this approach with a structured low fat eating plan.

      " Abstract: In this paper, a multiobjective framework for simultaneous reconfiguration and allocation of photovoltaic (PV) energy resources in radial distribution networks is performed for minimizing the power losses, lowering network loading factor, and reducing cost of energy resources as well as increasing the voltage stability index. A novel algorithm called the improved clouded leopard algorithm is used to find the set of optimum decision factors in the combined execution of restructuring and also PV resource distribution. The clouded leopard optimization (CLO) algorithm, which is widely used, takes its cues from the sleeping and foraging habits of the animal, and the improved CLO (ICLO) is formed using adaptive inertia weight to overcome premature convergence. In five cases of base distribution network and different contribution of reconfiguration and PV allocation, single-and multiobjective approach has been applied on 33-and 69-bus distribution networks. According to the findings, the best case includes simultaneous reconfiguration and PV allocation in the radial networks based on the multiobjective approach unlike the single-objective method which obtained the highest network performance with the best compromise between different goals. Also, in the best lowest losses, the decrease in the network loading and cost of energy resources and the better voltage profile and stability are obtained satisfying the constraints. The losses, network loading, voltage profile, and voltage stability are improved by 60.40%, 37.89%, 6.17%, and 27.5% for 33-bus network and also enhanced by 71.77%, 41.23%, 4.76%, and 20.48% for 69-bus network, respectively. Also, the results showed that network reconfiguration only has the weakest performance among other cases based on reconfiguration or photovoltaic sources. Moreover, the superior capability of the ICLO in addressing the aim of the study is proved in comparison with the traditional CLO and well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO) and manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) to obtain the better objective value and statistical criteria to solve the best case.  © 2024 Mohana Alanazi et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

Using micro-level data on inbound FDI relations in Germany, we find that a higher tax burden on income earned in a corporate subsidiary increases the probability that a multinational corporation (MNC) conducts foreign investment through a non-corporate flow-through. This effect is economically meaningful and varies with the relative importance of tax-motivated income shifting, a subsidiary’s non-tax benefits of limited liability and legal independence, and an MNC’s local knowledge. Moreover, we examine potential real effects of organizational form choices and document that affiliates established as flow-throughs exhibit a lower loss propensity and are less profitable than affiliates established as subsidiaries.

      " Abstract: Background: Therapeutic interventions for people with inflammatory arthritis (IA) increasingly involve multidisciplinary teams and strive to foster patient-centred care and shared decision making. Participation in health-care decisions requires patients to assert themselves and negotiate power in encounters with clinicians; however, clinical contexts often afford less authority for patients than clinicians. This disadvantage may inhibit patients' involvement in their own health care. Objective: To identify communication attributes, IA patients use to influence and negotiate their treatment with members of their health-care network. Method: A qualitative social network approach was used to analyse data from a larger study that investigated IA patients' overall experiences of multidisciplinary care. Fourteen patients with IA attended individual semi-structured interviews. Researchers used thematic analysis to identify patterns of assertiveness and influence in the data. Results: Participants experienced loss of identity, control and agency in addition to the physical symptoms of IA. However, they had a sense of personal responsibility for managing their health care. Perceptions of health-care team support enhanced patients' influence in treatment negotiations. Notably, there appeared to be an underlying tension between being empowered or disempowered. Discussion and conclusions: The findings have significant implications for treatment decision communication approaches to IA care. A social network perspective may provide a pathway for clinicians to better understand the complexities of communication with their patients. This approach may reduce unequal power dynamics that occur within clinician/patient interactions and afford people with IA agency, control and affirmation of identity within their health-care network. © 2020 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

Restoration decision-making is increasingly considering its social impacts, but how social factors should be incorporated in decision-making is a matter of debate. Multi-criteria approaches are promoted for their ability to overcome problems associated with monetary valuation of nature. Louisiana’s coastal restoration program has been promoted as a good example of a multi-criteria approach. This article engages in a critical examination of the wetland restoration program contained in Louisiana’s 2017 Coastal Master Plan (CMP). The principles that underlie decision-making, and how these principles are deployed through decision tools and metrics, constitute an implicit utilitarianism. This utilitarianism, in spite of the use of multiple criteria, recreates problems commonly associated with monetary valuation, namely, it creates poor distributional outcomes and fails to account for non-economic values of nature. The study argues that these problems can be overcome with a systematic use of the capability approach. This would involve the development of an evaluative framework that prioritizes the freedoms of the worst-off, and translation of this framework into a series of metrics compatible with planning models and tools. The paper closes by outlining some challenges to achieving a capability approach in Louisiana’s CMP. © 2022, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Thermolysis of Cp*W(NO)(CH2CMe3) (η3-CH2CHCHMe) (1) at ambient temperatures leads to the loss of neopentane and the formation of the η2-diene intermediate, Cp*W(NO)(η2-CH2=CHCH=CH 2) (A), which has been isolated as its 18e PMe3 adduct. In the presence of linear alkanes, A effects C-H activations of the hydrocarbons exclusively at their terminal carbons and forms 18e Cp*W(NO)(n-alkyl)- (η3-CH2CHCHMe) complexes. Similarly, treatments of 1 with methylcyclohexane, chloropentane, diethyl ether, and triethylamine all lead to the corresponding terminal C-H activation products. Furthermore, a judicious choice of solvents permits the C-H activation of gaseous hydrocarbons (i.e., propane, ethane, and methane) at ambient temperatures under moderately elevated pressures. However, reactions between intermediate A and cyclohexene, acetone, 3-pentanone, and 2-butyne lead to coupling between the η2-diene ligand and the site of unsaturation on the organic molecule. For example, Cp*W(NO)(η3,η1-CH2-CHCHCH 2C(CH2CH3)2O) is formed exclusively in 3-pentanone. When the site of unsaturation is sufficiently sterically hindered, as in the case of 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene, C-H activation again becomes dominant, and so the C-H activation product, Cp*W(NO)(η1- CH2CMe=CMe2)(η3-CH2CHCHMe), is formed exclusively from the alkene and 1. All new complexes have been characterized by conventional spectroscopic and analytical methods, and the solid-state molecular structures of most of them have been established by X-ray crystallographic analyses. Finally, the newly formed alkyl ligands may be liberated from the tungsten centers in the product complexes by treatment with iodine. Thus, exposure of a CDCl3 solution of the n-pentyl allyl complex, Cp*W(NO)(n-C5H11)(η3-CH 2CHCHMe), to I2 at -60°C produces n-C 5H11I in moderate yields. © 2008 American Chemical Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background Country decisions to scale-up “test and treat” approaches for HIV depend on consideration of both the health and economic consequences of such investments. Evidence about economic impacts of expanded antiretroviral therapy (ART) provision is particularly relevant for decisions regarding foreign assistance levels for HIV/AIDS programs. We used baseline data from the Sustainable East Africa Research in Community Health (SEARCH) cluster randomized controlled trial in Kenya and Uganda to examine the association between HIV status, CD4+ T-cell counts, viral suppression, and multiple indicators of economic well-being. Methods and findings Socio-economic surveys were conducted in households with HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults sampled after a census of 32 communities participating in the SEARCH trial (NCT01864603). Data were obtained for 11,500 individuals from 5,884 households in study communities. Participants were stratified based on their own HIV status as well as CD4 counts and viral suppression status if they were HIV-positive. HIV-negative participants residing in households with no HIV-positive adults were considered separately from HIV-negative participants residing in households with 1 HIV-positive adult. Generalized estimating equation models were used to examine the relationship between HIV status, CD4 counts, ART, viral suppression, and outcomes of employment, self-reported illness, lost time from usual activities due to illness, healthcare utilization, health expenditures, and hospitalizations. In all models, HIV-negative participants in households with no HIV-positive persons were the reference group. There was no significant difference in the probability of being employed between HIV-positive participants with CD4>500 and the reference group of HIV-negative participants residing in households with no HIV-positive adults (marginal effect, ME, 1.49 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, CI, -1.09, 4.08). However, HIV-positive participants with CD4 351–500 were less likely to be employed than the reference group (ME -4.50, 95% CI -7.99, -1.01), as were HIV-positive participants with CD4 350 (ME -7.41, 95% CI -10.96, -3.85). Similarly, there was no significant difference in employment likelihood between HIV-negative participants who resided in households with a CD4>500 HIV-positive person and the reference group (ME -1.78, 95% CI -5.16, 1.59). HIV-negative participants residing with an HIV-positive person with CD4 351–500, however, were less likely to be employed than the reference group (ME -7.03, 95% CI -11.49, -2.57), as were people residing with a household member with CD4 350 (ME -6.28, 95% CI -10.76, -1.80). HIV-positive participants in all CD4 categories were more likely to have lost time from usual activities due to illness and have incurred healthcare expenditures. Those with CD4>500 had better economic outcomes than those with CD4 351–500, even among those not virally suppressed (p = 0.004) and not on ART (p = 0.01). Conclusions Data from a large population-representative sample of households in east Africa showed a strong association between the health of HIV-positive persons and economic outcomes. The findings suggest there may be economic benefits associated with maintaining high CD4 counts, both for HIV-positive persons and their HIV-negative household members. The association of high CD4 counts with improved outcomes is consistent with the hypothesis that early ART initiation can avert declines in employment and other economic outcomes. Prospective longitudinal evaluation is needed to assess the causal impact of early ART initiation on economic functioning of households. © 2018 Jakubowski et al.

      " Abstract: People in need of care also require support within the framework of structured dental care in their different life situations. Nowadays, deteriorations in oral health tend to be noticed by chance, usually when complaints or pain are present. Information on dental care is also lost when life situations change. An older person may rely on family members having oral health skills. This competence is often not available, and a lot of oral health is lost. When someone, e.g., a dentist, physician, caregiver, or family member notices a dental care gap, a structured transition to ensure oral health should be established. The dental gap can be detected by, e.g., the occurrence of bad breath in a conversation with the relatives, as well as in the absence of previously regular sessions with the dental hygienist. The aim of the article is to present a model for a structured geriatric oral health care transition. Due to non-existing literature on this topic, a literature review was not possible. Therefore, a geriatric oral health care transition model (GOHCT) on the basis of the experiences and opinions of an expert panel was developed. The GOHCT model on the one hand creates the political, economic, and legal conditions for a transition process as a basis in a population-relevant approach within the framework of a transition arena with the representatives of various organizations. On the other hand, the tasks in the patient-centered approach of the transition stakeholders, e.g., patient, dentist, caregivers and relatives, and the transition manager in the transition process and the subsequent quality assurance are shown. © 2022 by the authors.

      " Abstract: The authors describe 3 human spatial navigation experiments that investigate how limitations of perception, memory, uncertainty, and decision strategy affect human spatial navigation performance. To better understand the effect of these variables on human navigation performance, the authors developed an ideal-navigator model for indoor navigation whose optimizing algorithm uses a partially observable Markov decision process. The model minimizes the number of actions (translations and rotations) required to move from an unknown starting state to a specific goal state in indoor environments that have perceptual ambiguity. The authors compared the model's performance with that of the human observer to measure human navigation efficiency. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of increasing the layout size on spatial way-finding efficiency and found that participants' efficiencies decreased as layout size increased. The authors investigated whether this reduction in navigation efficiency was due to visual perception (Experiment 2), memory, spatial updating strategy, or decision strategy (Experiment 3).

      " Abstract: Common practises for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) include the estimation of frequencies of releases and related initial causes; these are a function of several parameters such as components failure rates, probabilities of human error, equipment damage and managerial factors. The availability of general values for such parameters from the literature simplifies the work of the risk analyst, but standardised results are provided, which unfortunately do not permit taking into consideration the plant's specificity The specificity of the establishment is defined through its management system, thus if managerial and organisational factors are neglected or not proper assessed, risk analysis for two identical establishments, characterised by totally different management systems, gives the same results and this appears absolutely unacceptable especially when risk analysis is used for risk-based decisions. This paper aims quantifying the effects of managerial and organisational variables on the frequency of losses of containment of pipeworks, by using a simple and flexible method developed by Milazzo and co-authors in 2010. Such a methodology has been tested on a new case-study and the results of the assessment have been evaluated from both the sensitivity and uncertainty points of view.

      " Abstract: Irrigation is essential to ensure food security in arid and semi-regions and even in countries affected by water scarcity. Furthermore, monitoring water quality using appropriate water quality indicators can be a valuable approach in developing sustainable groundwater management strategies. Therefore, the aims of this study are to establish a Water Quality Index (WQI) for irrigation purposes and to predict groundwater appropriateness in Chiba watershed in Nabeul, Tunisia. The research methodology applied in this study integrates a comprehensive WQI calculation within a GIS framework to evaluate and forecast groundwater suitability for irrigation. In addition, the main parameters of this WQI are associated with the risk of the salinity problems, the reduction of water infiltration in the soil, and plant toxicity. The findings reveal that 84.38% of the analyzed samples present an average WQI value below 40, indicating severe restriction. However, only 3.12% of the samples are classified into low restriction class, with WQI values ranging between 70 and 85. The poor water quality observed is mainly attributed to both natural and anthropogenic factors. This study can be useful for decision-makers to adopt appropriate measures for water resource management and to mitigate the risks associated with crop toxicity, soil degradation, and yield loss. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: The HIV epidemic continues to amplify in southern Africa and there is a growing need for HIV prevention interventions among people who have tested HIV positive. Methods: Anonymous surveys were completed by 413 HIV-positive men and 641 HIV-positive women sampled from HIV/AIDS services; 73% were <35 years old, 70% Black African, 70% unemployed, 75% unmarried, and 50% taking antiretroviral treatment. Results: Among the 903 (85%) participants who were currently sexually active, 378 (42%) had sex with a person to whom they had not disclosed their HIV status in the previous 3 months. Participants who had not disclosed their HIV status to their sex partners were considerably more likely to have multiple partners, HIV-negative partners, partners of unknown HIV status and unprotected intercourse with non-concordant sex partners. Not disclosing their HIV status to partners was also associated with having lost a job or a place to stay because of being HIV positive and feeling less able to disclose to partners. Conclusions: HIV-related stigma and discrimination are associated with not disclosing HIV status to sex partners, and non-disclosure is closely associated with HIV transmission risk behaviours.

      " Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is perceived as a promising energy management mechanism for decentralized renewable energy sources. The concept of energy local area network (e-LAN) is proposed as a new system framework for future microgrids to facilitate P2P trading where the end-to-end power delivery is achieved by energy routing. Decentralized P2P trading in e-LAN requires a perfectly competitive market and flexible end-to-end power delivery. In this paper, a new P2P trading model incorporating decentralized energy routing is proposed for e-LAN. The proposed model is composed of a P2P energy market and a loss compensation market. In the P2P energy market, a tripartite graph model is proposed to represent transactions where trading decisions and energy routing are jointly considered for each participant to pursue its optimal benefit. Considering the size problem and nonlinear weights of the tripartite graph, an extended depth-first branch-and-bound algorithm is proposed to prune low-efficiency paths. Based on the pruned tripartite graph, the competitive P2P market is captured by a multi-leader multi-follower Stackelberg game model. A loss compensation market is established to coordinate energy routing paths planned in a decentralized manner. By means of setting the price for utilizing each transmission line, the loss compensation market avoids network congestion and ensure a normal operation of e-LAN. Simulation results show that the proposed model can bring higher utilities for P2P participants compared with the existing P2P trading models in e-LAN. Additionally, the effectiveness of the proposed model in resolving path conflicts in a decentralized fashion and improving computation efficiency, are verified. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: PSYCHIC is a process-based model of phosphorus (P) and suspended sediment (SS) mobilisation in land runoff and subsequent delivery to watercourses. Modelled transfer pathways include release of desorbable soil P, detachment of SS and associated particulate P, incidental losses from manure and fertiliser applications, losses from hard standings, the transport of all the above to watercourses in underdrainage (where present) and via surface pathways, and losses of dissolved P from point sources. The model can operate at two spatial scales, although the scientific core is the same in both cases. At catchment scale, the model uses easily available national scale datasets to infer all necessary input data whilst at field scale, the user is required to supply all necessary data. The model is sensitive to a number of crop and animal husbandry decisions, as well as to environmental factors such as soil type and field slope angle. It is envisaged that the catchment-scale model would provide the first tier of a catchment characterisation study, and would be used as a screening tool to identify areas within the catchment which may be at elevated risk of P loss. This would enable targeted data collection, involving farm visits and stakeholder discussion, which would then be followed up with detailed field-scale modelling. Both tiers allow the effects of possible mitigation options at catchment scale (Tier 1) and field scale (Tier 2) to be explored. The PSYCHIC model framework therefore provides a methodology for identifying critical source areas of sediment and P transfer in catchments and assessing what management changes are required to achieve environmental goals. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In a procedure modeled after Hackenberg and Joker (1994), 7 adults were presented with repeated choices between progressive-and fixed-time schedules of reinforcement and were given instructions (rules) for how to respond to maximize earnings. Across sessions, the progressive-time schedule step size was manipulated so that the instructions became increasingly inaccurate, and deviating from the instructions produced greater earnings. The experiment consisted of two phases, Penalty and No Penalty. During the Penalty phase, deviating from the instructions produced a money-loss penalty (response-cost punishment). Two participants showed persistent instructional control and therefore completed only one phase (Penalty or No Penalty), and 1 participant showed little instructional control during the Penalty phase until the punishment magnitude was increased. In all 4 participants who experienced both Penalty and No Penalty phases, punishment increased the consistency of choices with the instructions, and in 2 of these participants punishment increased the progressive-schedule step size at which choices began to systematically deviate from the instructions. These results show that monetary penalties for breaking with rules may enhance instructional control, but that deviations from rules still occur under punishment when such deviations produce greater reinforcement than rule following.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Many economic analyses fail to incorporate evidence on child health-related quality of life because of a paucity of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates. This health valuation study is the first to summarize the EQ-5D-Y on a QALY scale. Drawn from a nationally representative panel, 5207 adult respondents were asked to choose between two losses in child health-related quality of life. Based on their choices, a 1-year increase in child pain/discomfort from 'some' to 'a lot' equals a loss of 4 QALYs (95% CI, 3.8-4.4). Likewise, a 1-year increase in child anxiety/depression from 'a bit' to 'very worried, sad, or unhappy' equals a loss of 2 QALYs (95% CI, 1.9-2.2). These findings enable the integration of child-reported outcomes with adult preferences to inform economic analysis.

      " Abstract: Renewable energies, especially energy from biomass, contribute to the sustainable development of the territory. Simultaneously, by using biomass to produce bioenergy, bioreproductive land is devoted to supply energy. As the bioreproductive land area on the European level is decreasing, bioenergy competes against other demands like the production of food, industrial resources or cultural goods and services, among others, thus the correct assessment of the available local potential is important for local and regional planning. Moreover, bioenergy system being a socio-ecological system requires integrated approaches for the evaluation of the factors, components and interactions of such a system, considering that agriculture presents one of the major drivers of the land use change and biodiversity loss. Therefore, this work was focused on the development of the approach for and on the assessment of biogas potentials to provide a support for decision-makers and bioenergy industry at a local scale. The approach exploits the spatial relations among territorial units (i.e., a contiguity analysis), and integrates time series of continuous and discrete data. It is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) combined with GIS-based analysis, and permitted to develop a territorial information system in support for biogas planning, perform analysis of feedstock for biogas from different sources potential and produce plausible scenarios for identification of biogas suitable territorial clusters; the analysis of the tradeoffs between the use of different local sources of the feedstock for biogas production are discussed as well. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: We sought to investigate whether preadmission quality of life could act as a predictor of mortality among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Materials and methods: This is a prospective observational study of all patients above the age of 18 years admitted to the ICU with a length of stay longer than 24 hours. Short form 36 (SF-36) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) were used. Mortality was assessed during ICU admission, 30, and 90 days hereafter. Results: We included 318 patients. No patients were lost to follow-up. Using the physical component summary of short form 12 (SF-12) as a predictor of ICU mortality, the area under the curve (0.70; confidence interval, 0.62-0.77) was comparable with that of APACHE II (0.74; confidence interval, 0.67-0.82). The difference between SF-12 and SF-36 was nonsignificant. Conclusions: Preadmission quality of life, assessed by SF-36 and SF-12, is as good at predicting ICU, 30-, and 90-day mortality as APACHE II in patients admitted to the ICU for longer than 24 hours. This indicates that estimated preadmission quality of life, potentially available in the pre-ICU setting, could aid decision making regarding ICU admission and deserves more attention by those caring for critically ill patients. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: We have developed a risk stratification score to identify cardiac surgical patients at higher risk of severe postoperative bleeding to aid a decision of whether to use a specific intervention preoperatively. Methods: We prospectively created a database of 11592 consecutive patients, who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. An adverse outcome was formally defined as a mean blood loss exceeding 2mlkg -1h -1 measured between arrival in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the earliest of the elapse of 3h; the start of transfusion of any one of fresh-frozen plasma, platelets or cryoprecipitate; return to theatre or death. Univariate and multivariate associations of severe postoperative bleeding with patient characteristics, clinical features and procedure details were analysed on a development set. The final risk stratification scheme was then evaluated on a test set. Results: Severe postoperative bleeding was associated with urgent or emergency surgery, surgery that was not coronary artery bypass grafting or single valve surgery, presence of aortic valve disease, low body mass index and older age. A risk stratification score was constructed from the above variables to define preoperative categories that demonstrated high, medium and low risk of severe postoperative bleeding. Patients deemed to be at high, medium and low risk by our preoperative scoring had a 21% (95% confidence interval: 18-24%), 8% (7-10%) and 3% (2-4%) rate of severe postoperative bleeding, respectively, within the test set. Conclusion: We have developed a simple risk stratification score that can separate, preoperatively, patients into risk groups with markedly different rates of severe postoperative bleeding. © 2010 European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Process capability indices have been introduced for measuring process reproduction capability of a manufacturing industry. The loss-based capability index C pmtakes into account the degree of process targeting (centering), which essentially measures the process performance on the basis of average process loss. Generally, the underlying manufacturing process data are obtained from the output responses of continuous quantities, which are always assumed to be real numbers. However, in a practical situation, the data collected by output process measurements are often imprecise (fuzzy data). We propose a constructive methodology for obtaining the fuzzy estimate of C pm using fuzzy data, which is based on \"resolution identity\" in fuzzy sets theory. We propose four decision rules to judge the process condition by simultaneously introducing randomness and fuzziness. Finally, we present a sequence of testing steps for assessing manufacturing process performance using the critical value of C pm with fuzzy data and can be easily implemented in real situations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) in patients with chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) represents a significant neurosurgical challenge. While continuation of ASA during the perioperative phase might increase recurrence and bleeding rates, discontinuation increases the risk of thromboembolic events. The aim of this study is to compare the postoperative recurrence and cardiovascular complication rates of patients undergoing burr-hole trepanation for cSDH with and without discontinuation of ASA. Methods: In this prospective randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study we include all patients undergoing burr-hole drainage of cSDH who are under ASA treatment. The patients are randomized into two groups, one receiving ASA and the other placebo perioperatively. The study primarily seeks to compare the rate of recurrent events under ASA to that under placebo treatment. Secondary objectives are thromboembolic event rate, perioperative blood loss, postoperative anemia, intra- and postoperative blood transfusion rate, and clinical outcome. Discussion: To date, there is no evidence-based consensus on how to manage patients undergoing burr-hole drainage for cSDH who are under ASA treatment. Therefore, the decision to maintain or interrupt ASA treatment is based mostly on the surgeons' preference. A randomized placebo-controlled study for this frequent question is urgently needed in order to provide class I evidence for the best possible treatment of this large group of patients. © 2019 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The colonic delivery system of toxin neutralizing antibody is a promising method for treating Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and has some advantages over the parental administration of a neutralizing antibody. However, colonic delivery of biologics presents several challenges, including instability of biologics during encapsulation into the delivery system and harsh conditions in the upper GI tract. In this work, we described a multi-particulate delivery system encapsulating a tetra-valent antibody ABAB-IgG1 with the potential to treat CDI. This work first approved that the cecum injection of ABAB-IgG1 into the lower GI tract of mice could relieve the symptoms, enhance the clinical score, and improve the survival rate of mice during CDI. Then, the antibody was spray layered onto mannitol beads and then enteric coated with pH-sensitive polymers to achieve colon-targeting release. The in vitro release of antibody from the multi-particulate system and the pH-sensitive release of antibody was monitored. The in vivo efficacy of this system was further examined and confirmed in mice and hamsters. In summary, the findings of this study should provide practical information and potential treatment options for CDI through colonic delivery of antibody therapeutics to the lower GI tract using a multi-particulate delivery system. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Glass-fiber-reinforced endodontic posts (GFRPs), in combination with composite resin core materials, are commonly used to build up damaged endodontically treated teeth. However, long-term clinical data are scarce. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to evaluate the survival of 3 different GFRP systems, taking into account several other relevant factors. Methods: One-hundred forty-nine GFRPs in 122 patients were followed for up to 120 months. GFRPs were adhesively luted using the etch-and-rinse technique. The core was built with a chemically curing composite resin and restored according to the specific prosthetic treatment plan. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between clinical variables and the time until failure. Results: Within 10 years, 55 failures could be observed (annual failure rate = 4.6%) with the most frequent ones being post fracture, loss of post retention (both n = 17), endodontic problems (n = 7), and those resulting in tooth extraction (n = 10). Sixty posts could be followed up for 105 to 120 months (34 posts lost to follow-up, [mean (standard deviation) survival time: 74 (43) months]). In crude analyses, only the tooth type in favor of posterior teeth compared with anterior teeth and the number of remaining cavity walls (in favor of ≥1compared with no wall) were significantly associated with the failure rate. Cox regression analysis revealed a significant hazard ratio of 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.5; P =.021) for tooth type in favor of posterior teeth. Conclusions: The relatively high annual failure rate of GFRPs highlights that the treatment decision should take into account the most relevant factors as tooth type and the number of remaining cavity walls. © 2012 American Association of Endodontists.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: Patient production losses occur when individuals' capacities to work, whether paid or unpaid, are impaired by illness, treatment, disability, or death. Thereis controversy about whether and how to include patient production losses in economic evaluations in health care. Patient production losses have not previously been considered when evaluating medications for reimbursement under the U.K. National Health Service. Proposals for value-based assessment of health technologies in the United Kingdom created renewed interest in whether and how to include costs from a wider societal perspective, such as patient production losses, within economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. Methods: A narrative review was undertaken of theoretical, ethical, and policy issues that might inform decisions that involve the normative question of whether or not to include patient production losses in economic evaluation. Results: It seems difficult to reconcile the implications of including patient production losses with the objectives of a healthcare system dedicated to providing universal healthcare coverage without regard to patients' ability to pay.

      " Abstract: Hysterectomy is the empirical treatment for female pelvic organ prolapse (POP) without robust evidence to prove its efficacy. Uphold transvaginal mesh (TVM) system is an innovated device with smaller area, superior anterior/apical support with single incision to treat POP. The prospective cohort study aims to evaluate Uphold TVM's performance with or without concomitant hysterectomy. Inclusion criteria specify patients suffering from stage 2 or more anterior/apical prolapse without previous hysterectomy. Exclusion criteria specify those with contraindications to uterine preservation, such as leiomyomas, adenomyosis, endometrial hyperplasia, abnormal uterine bleeding, postmenopausal bleeding, cervical dysplasia, receiving tamoxifen treatment, family history of gynecology cancer, or colon cancer and incapability to be routinely followed. Thirty patients are recruited in the hysterectomy group and 66 patients in the hysteropexy group. The results demonstrate that patients with Uphold mesh only experience longer vaginal length, shorter operation duration, less blood loss and less post-operation pain. The performance in anatomical correction, lower urinary tract symptoms improvement, de novo dyspareunia, urodynamic study parameters and mesh extrusion rates are comparable with or without uterus preservation. The information is useful in pre-operation counseling, when the patient can make an educated choice whether or not to receive concomitant hysterectomy. © 2018 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

The system consists of an array of Wii Balance Boards (WBB) and an exergame that estimates whether the player can maintain physical independence, comparing the results with the 30 s Chair-Stand Test (30CST). Methods: Sixteen participants recruited at a nursing home performed the 30CST and then played the exergame described here as often as desired during a period of 2 weeks. For each session, features related to walking and standing on the WBBs while playing the exergame were collected. Different classifier algorithms were used to predict the result of the 30CST on a binary basis as able or unable to maintain physical independence. Results: By using a Logistic Model Tree, we achieved a maximum accuracy of 91% when estimating whether player’s 30CST scores were over or under a threshold of 12 points, our findings suggest that predicting age- and sex-adjusted cutoff scores is feasible. Conclusion: An array of WBBs seems to be a viable solution to estimate lower extremity strength and thereby functional performance in a non-invasive and continuous manner.

Improvements in the fields of prosthetics and vascularized composite allotransplantation have opened exciting new frontiers for treatment and rehabilitation following upper limb loss. Each modality offers a unique set of advantages and limitations with regard to the restoration of hand function following amputation. Methods: Presented in this article is a discussion outlining the complex considerations and decisions encountered when determining patient appropriateness for either prosthetic rehabilitation or vascularized composite allotransplantation following upper limb loss. In this review, the authors examine how psychosocial factors, nature of injury, rehabilitation course, functional outcomes, and risks and benefits may affect overall patient selection for either rehabilitative approach. Results: This review summarizes the current state of the literature. Advancements in both prosthetic and biological strategies demonstrate promise with regard to facilitating rehabilitation following upper limb loss. However, there remains a dearth of research directly comparing outcomes in prosthetic rehabilitation to that following upper extremity transplantation. Conclusions: Few studies have performed a direct comparison between patients undergoing vascularized composite allotransplantation and those undergoing prosthetic rehabilitation.

      " Abstract: In many circumstances a telephone call can be completed through a connecting network in several ways. Hence, there naturally arise problems of optimal routing, that is, of making the choices of routes so as to achieve extrema of one or more measures of system performance, such as the loss (probability of blocking) or the carried load. As is customary in traffic theory, a Markov process is used to describe network operation with complete information. The controlled system is described by linear differential equations with the control functions (expressing the routing method, being used) among the coefficients. Restricting attention to asymptotic behavior leads to a problem of maximizing a bilinear form subject to a linear equality constraint whose matrix is itself constrained to lie in a given convex set. An alternative approach first shows that minimizing the loss, and maximizing the fraction of events that are successful attempts to place a call, are equivalent. This fact permits a dynamic programming formulation, which, in turn, leads to a very large linear programming problem. Two small examples are treated numerically by this method. It is particularly important to try to verbalize, and then mechanize, the optimal routing strategies. In this endeavor, the linear programming formulation is of limited usefulness. Therefore, in the latter half of the work we have attempted to use the special combinatorial structure imposed by the telephonic origins of the problem to shed light on the character of the optimal strategies. In particular, we show that for connecting networks with suitable combinatorial properties, the optimal route choices can be very simply described. Some of the remits obtained were suggested by, and verify, conjectures from the practical lore of telephone routing. The problem of routing calls falls into two parts: Which attempted calls should be accepted in which states? What route should an accepted call use? The first problem is very hard, and only sample numerical answers for small networks are obtained. We solve the second problem analytically for a large class of cases by appeal to combinatorial structure in the network. These cases can be described roughly as those in which the relative merit of states (as far as blocking is concerned) is consistent or continuous; i.e., if a state x is “better” than another y, then the neighbors of x are in the same sense “better” than the corresponding neighbors of y. An abundance of examples indicates that these cases are numerous and so warrant attention. In a network with this kind of combinatorial property, a policy which rejects no unblocked calls and minimizes the number of additional calls that are blocked by completing an attempted call differs from an optimal policy only in that the latter may reject some calls. © 1966 The Bell System Technical Journal\u001b[0m :\n",

Point-of-care (POC) technologies have the potential to address these gaps and improve healthcare systems. This study ascertained the acceptability and impact of POC CD4 testing on patients’ health and clinical management. Methods: We conducted a qualitative survey study with patients (n = 642) and healthcare providers (n = 13) at the Lancers Road (experienced POC) and Chesterville (non-experienced POC) primary healthcare (PHC) clinics from September 2015 to June 2016. Results: Patients (99%) at Lancers and Chesterville PHCs were positive about POC CD4 testing, identifying benefits: No loss/delay of test results (6.4%), cost/time saving (19.5%), and no anxiety (5.1%), and 58.2% were ready to initiate treatment. Significantly more patients at Chesterville than Lancers Road PHC felt POC would provide rapid clinical decision making (64.7% vs. 48.1%; p < 0.0001) and better clinic accessibility (40.4% vs. 24.7%; p < 0.0001) respectively. Healthcare providers thought same-day CD4 results would impact: Clinical management (46.2%), patient readiness (46.2%), and adherence (23.0%), and would reduce follow-up visits (7.7%), while 38.5% were concerned that further tests and training (15.4%) were required before antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation.

      " Abstract: Background: Vitamin A deficiency is a major public health nutrition problem, affecting an estimated 190 million preschool-aged children and 19 million pregnant and lactating women globally, and 83 million adolescents in Southeast Asia alone. Its consequences (disorders) include xerophthalmia (the leading cause of early childhood blindness), increased severity of infection, anemia, and death. Because vitamin A deficiency is largely due to chronic dietary insufficiency of preformed vitamin A and proactive carotenoids, food fortification can offer an effective approach to prevention. Objective: To provide guidance on fortifying wheat and maize flour milled in industrial rollers for national fortification programs in countries where vitamin A deficiency is considered a public health problem. Methods: Critical review of the literature on the dietary gap in vitamin A intake and levels of wheat flour intake among risk groups as a basis for determining vitamin A fortificant levels. Additional review of efficacy evidence, safety and cost considerations, and country experiences related to wheat-flour fortification with vitamin A. Results: Mill-rolled wheat flour is a technically fortifiable, centrally processed food vehicle that, where routinely and adequately consumed by target groups, should be considered a candidate for fortification. Vitamin A can be stable in flour under typical, ambient conditions, with processing losses estimated at approximately 30%, depending on source and premix conditions. Conclusions: Factors to guide a decision to fortify flour with vitamin A include the extent of deficiency, availability of other food vehicle options, the centrality of milling market reach and population intake distributions of the flour products, the dietary vitamin A intake required, and associated costs. Large gaps persist in knowledge of these factors, which are needed to enable evidence-based fortification in most countries, leaving most decisions to fortify guided by assumptions. Where flour can and should be fortified, guidelines are given for providing nearly 25% of the Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin A to vulnerable groups consuming varying ranges of flour products.

In heterogeneous networks, an E2E path may go through domains with several QoS classes in each domain. However, the prevalent legacy network architecture and the standard software-defined networking (SDN) model lack effective mechanisms for inter-domain collaboration and QoS class mapping. In this study, we propose a hierarchical SDN control plane approach to guarantee the E2E QoS among multiple domains with various QoS classes on the E2E path. We propose a controller module for selecting the most suitable QoS class for each domain in the E2E path based on multi-criteria decision-making by using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). We map the suitable service classes in the global controller (GC) for provisioning the E2E QoS according to the application service requests. First, we propose an SDN-based inter-domain communication scheme and the message processing algorithm for E2E service delivery when multiple QoS classes exist in each domain. Next, we formulate the problem of service class selection with TOPSIS, provide an E2E mapping scheme, and demonstrate it with an example. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with the existing schemes for E2E QoS class mapping in terms of E2E delay, jitter, packet loss rate (PLR), and cost (per bandwidth unit). According to our simulation results, the proposed approach ensures the E2E QoS and guarantees the E2E delay, jitter, PLR, and cost according to the application service requests. © 2013 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background:Use of a patient body mass index (BMI) eligibility threshold for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is controversial. A strict BMI criterion may reduce surgical complication rates, but over-restrict access to effective osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Factors that influence orthopaedic surgeons' use of BMI thresholds are unknown. We aimed to identify and explore orthopaedic surgeons' perspectives regarding patient BMI eligibility thresholds for TJA.Methods:A cross-sectional, online qualitative survey was distributed to orthopaedic surgeons who conduct hip and/or knee TJA in the United States. Survey questions were open-ended, and responses were collected anonymously. Survey data were coded and analyzed in an iterative, systematic process to identify predominant themes.Results:Forty-five surveys were completed. Respondents were 54.3 ± 12.4 years old (range, 34 to 75 years), practiced in 22 states, and had 21.2 ± 13.3 years (range, 2 to 44 years) of surgical experience. Twelve factors influencing BMI threshold use by orthopaedic surgeons were identified: (1) evidence interpretation, (2) personal experiences, (3) difficulty of surgery, (4) professional ramifications, (5) ethics and biases, (6) health-system policies and performance metrics, (7) surgical capacity and resources, (8) patient body fat distribution, (9) patient self-advocacy, (10) control of decision-making in the clinical encounter, (11) expectations for demonstrated weight loss, and (12) research and innovation gaps.Conclusions:Multilevel, complex factors underlie BMI threshold use for TJA eligibility. Addressing identified factors at the patient, surgeon, and health-system levels should be considered to optimally balance complication avoidance with improving access to life-enhancing surgery.Clinical Relevance:This study may influence how orthopaedic surgeons think about their own practices and how they approach patients and consider surgical eligibility. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

      " Abstract: Aim/Purpose In response to widespread efforts to increase the size and diversity of the biomedical-research workforce in the U.S., a large-scale qualitative study was conducted to examine current and former students' training experiences in MD (Doctor of Medicine), PhD (Doctor of Philosophy), and MD-PhD dual-degree programs. In this paper, we aimed to describe the experiences of a subset of study participants who had dropped out their MD-PhD dual-degree training program, the reasons they entered the MD-PhD program, as well as their reasons for discontinuing their training for the MD-PhD. Background To our knowledge, the U.S. has the longest history of MD-PhD dual-degree training programs dating back to the 1950s and produces the largest number of MD-PhD graduates in the world. Integrated dual-degree MD-PhD programs are offered at more than 90 medical schools in the U.S., and historically have included three phases - preclinical, PhD-research, and clinical training, all during medical-school training. On average, it takes eight years of training to complete requirements for the MD-PhD dual-degree. MD-PhD students have unique training experiences, different from MD-only or PhD-only students. Not all MD-PhD students complete their training, at a cost to funding agencies, schools, and students themselves. Methodology We purposefully sampled from 97 U.S. schools with doctoral programs, posting advertisements for recruitment of participants who were engaged in or had completed PhD, MD, and MD-PhD training. Between 2011 and 2013, semi-structured, one-on-one phone interviews were conducted with 217 participants. Using a phenomenological approach and inductive, thematic analysis, we examined students' reasons for entering the MD-PhD dual-degree program, when they decided to leave, and their reasons for leaving MD-PhD training. Contribution Study findings offer new insights into MD-PhD students' reasons for leaving the program, beyond what is known about program attrition based on retrospective analysis of existing national data, as little is known about students' actual reasons for attrition. By more deeply exploring students' reasons for attrition, programs can find ways to improve MD-PhD students' training experiences and boost their retention in these dual-degree programs to completion, which will, in turn, foster expansion of the biomedical-research-workforce capacity. Findings Seven participants in the larger study reported during their interview that they left their MD-PhD programs before finishing, and these were the only participants who reported leaving their doctoral training. At the time of interview, two participants had completed the MD and were academic-medicine faculty, four were completing medical school, and one dropped out of medicine to complete a PhD in Education. Participants reported enrolling in MD-PhD programs to work in both clinical practice and research. Very positive college research experiences, mentorship, and personal reasons also played important roles in participants' decisions to pursue the dual MD-PhD degree. However, once in the program, positive mentorship and other opportunities that they experienced during or after college, which initially drew candidates to the program was found lacking. Four themes emerged as reasons for leaving the MD-PhD program: (1) declining interest in research, (2) isolation and lack of social integration during the different training phases, (3) suboptimal PhD-advising experiences, and (4) unforeseen obstacles to completing PhD research requirements, such as loss of funding. Recommendations Though limited by a small sample size, findings highlight the need for better for Practitioners integrated institutional and programmatic supports for MD-PhD students, especially during PhD training. Recommendations Researchers should continue to explore if other programmatic aspects of for Researchers MD-PhD training (other than challenges experienced during PhD training, as discussed in this paper) are particularly problematic and pose challenges to the successful completion of the program. Impact on Society The MD-PhD workforce comprises a small, but highly trained cadre of physician-scientists with the expertise to conduct clinical and/or basic science research aimed at improving patient care and developing new diagnostic tools and therapies. Although MD-PhD graduates comprise a small proportion of all MD graduates in the U.S. and globally, about half of all MD-trained physician-scientists in the U.S. federally funded biomedical-research workforce are MD-PhD-trained physicians. Training is extensive and rigorous. Improving experiences during the PhD-training phase could help reduce MD-PhD program attrition, as attrition results in substantial financial cost to federal and private funding agencies and to medical schools that fund MD-PhD programs in the U.S. and other countries. Future Research Future research could examine, in greater depth, how communications among students, faculty and administrators in various settings, such as classrooms, research labs, and clinics, might help MD-PhD students become more fully integrated into each new program phase and continue in the program to completion. Future research could also examine experiences of MD-PhD students from groups underrepresented in medicine and the biomedical-research workforce (e.g., first-generation college graduates, women, and racial/ethnic minorities), which might serve to inform interventions to increase the numbers of applicants to MD-PhD programs and help reverse the steady decline in the physician-scientist workforce over the past several decades. © This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.

      " Abstract: Non-point source (NPS) pollution simulation in control units can identify critical pollution source areas and make Best Management Practices (BMPs) more effective for the responsible parties. In this study, the control unit division method is introduced, and the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of NPS pollution in the Guishui River Basin of Northern China are analyzed using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. In addition, five BMP scenarios were designed for environmental and cost-benefit analyses. The results show that the loss of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is concentrated in the rainy season, and the loss of TN and TP is mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the main stream of the Guishui River. This area accounts for 22.34% of the basin area. The vegetated filter strips (VFS) scenario had the best environmental benefits with average TN and TP reduction efficiencies of 63.4% and 62.6%, respectively. The Grassed Waterway was the most cost-effective scenario measure, cost-benefit (CE) values of TN and TP were 1798.13 g/€ and 601.56 g/€. Generally, research on NPS pollution using control units can more clearly identify the critical source areas of pollution than other methods, and provides technical support for watershed management decision makers. © 2020 by the authors.

      " Abstract: Environmental resource management policies worldwide have long insisted on the need to involve local communities and their diverse ecological knowledges in management planning and decision-making. In Sub-Saharan post-colonial countries, however, formal resource management is still largely dominated by bureaucratic governance regimes that date back to colonial power structures and that rely mainly on professional or formal knowledge. In this study, we use a political ecology approach to analyze disputes over eucalyptus plantations in the Taita Hills, Kenya. The approach recognizes the plurality of socially constructed and power-laden perceptions of environmental resources. We found that local people regard eucalyptus plantations not only as a threat to local water resources but they also highlight historical injustices and the loss of control over, and cultural relationships to their land. Bureaucratic resource management institutions, however, support the planting of eucalyptus to meet national demands for commercial forestry. Management officials also plead a lack of \"valid\" evidence for the negative impacts of eucalyptus on local water resources, diverting attention away from the formal environmental governance system which has unequal sharing of benefits, unclear policies, and internal incoherence. Recognition of historically rooted asymmetries of knowledge and power provides a step towards social transformation, ending a long-standing reproduction of subalternity, and promoting environmental justice and pluralism in decision-making. © 2018 The University of Arizona Libraries.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Boric acid (BA) effectively controls wood-rotting fungi and termite attack but is readily leached out in outdoor exposure. A newly developed tannin-boron (TB) complex has been investigated to reduce BA leaching and to preserve beech plywood from biological attack. Wood veneers were impregnated with different TB solutions and then bonded with a melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) adhesive for bond class 2 applications. The formation of a solid hydrophobic TB network on the veneer surfaces partially decreased the tensile shear strength of plywood but the prepared panels met the requirements for bond class 2. The plywood samples made from veneers treated with only BA solutions showed fair resistance against white rot fungus and termite attack, but the durability decreased even after mild leaching tests. The panels made of treated veneers with TB formulations showed instead a high resistance against biological attack after mild leaching and to some extent after severe leaching tests. This depended on the concentration of tannin and BA in the solutions. Favorable results were obtained with 20% tannin in the formulation. The results of the termites feeding choice test were more positive than those obtained by a forced feeding test. The control samples were attacked faster and showed higher weight loss when alternative samples included TB formulations. © 2017 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Wireless multicast for delay-sensitive data is challenging because of the heterogeneity effect where each receiver may experience different packet losses. Fortunately, network coding, a new advanced routing protocol, offers significant advantages over the traditional Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) protocols in that it mitigates the need for retransmission and has the potential to approach the min-cut capacity. Network-coded multicast would be, however, vulnerable to false packet injection attacks, in which the adversary injects bogus packets to prevent receivers from correctly decoding the original data. Without a right defense in place, even a single bogus packet can completely change the decoding outcome. Existing solutions either incur high computation cost or cannot withstand high packet loss. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to defend against false packet injection attacks on network-coded multicast for delay-sensitive data. Specifically, we propose an efficient authentication mechanism based on null space properties of coded packets, aiming to enable receivers to detect any bogus packets with high probability. We further design an adaptive scheduling algorithm based on the Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to maximize the number of authenticated packets received within a given time constraint. Both analytical and simulation results have been provided to demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our proposed scheme. © 2013 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Classic dissection of the hilar structures during the hepatectomy portion of the liver transplant procedure is sometimes extremely difficult and even dangerous. In such cases, clamping of the hepatic hilar structures en mass can be an effective alternative. In this study, we describe our center's experience with this technique. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of all patients who received a liver allograft using this technique at our center, between September 1996 and September 2007 (n = 150). Postoperative follow-up was through November 30, 2007. Results: One hundred fifty patients underwent 155 liver transplants using hilar mass clamping. These cases represent 7% of the total number of cases performed at our center during that time interval (n = 2219). This included 93 male and 57 female patients, 18 children and 132 adults. There were 103 primary liver transplants, 52 retransplants. Three of the primary transplants were combined liver/kidney transplants. In 7 cases (4.5%), portacaval hemitransposition was performed to establish portal flow.The decision to perform the hepatectomy with mass clamping of the hilar structures was an intraoperative judgment made when severe vascular adhesions and scarring of the hilum (n = 137) or extensive hilar varices (n = 18) were encountered. The hilar pathology was often associated with hepatic artery (n = 15) or portal vein thrombosis (n = 14).Mean surgical time was 11.33 ± 0.28 hours. Average blood replacement was 26.27 ± 2.05 units of packed red blood cells. One patient died intraoperatively (0.64%) while perioperative (30 day) mortality was 6.4%. Venovenous by pass was used in 1 patient (0.64%).One and 5 year patient survival was 75.3% and 61.2%, respectively. One and 5 year graft survival was 73.7% and 48.2%, respectively. There was no patient mortality, graft loss, or technical complications that could be attributed to the mass clamp technique. Conclusion: Mass clamping of the hepatic hilum can be an effective alternative to classic hilar dissection in cases when the latter is difficult or impossible. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Comparative results show that the actual irreversible loss in CRS is 8.1% higher. Further, advanced exergy analysis results showed that 17.985kW irreversible loss (out of 33.737kW irreversible loss) in the system is evadable with improvement in the system design. Besides, the vulnerability of toxic fluid R717 is reported in terms of the total risk level. Moreover, the economy matter is expressed in terms of its total thermal inventory. At the base case, total risk level and total thermal inventory are determined to be 454.3 US$ and 48.86kW/K, respectively. First, sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the variation in irreversible loss, total risk level and thermal inventory at different evaporator and condenser temperatures with different degrees of overlap (decision variables). A total of nine simulations are designed using the Taguchi technique. Later, multi-objective optimization is employed. The optimization process reduced the total irreversibility and annual risk level of CRS by 10.2% and 8.9%, respectively, with 6.8% increase in thermal inventory.  © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

While reference dependence is extensively studied, very little is known regarding the impact of reference points on individual choice behavior when the reference points themselves are not chosen (Reference Effect). We identify critical properties that differentiate between classes of reference-dependent models and test them. We find that the reference effect exists for asymmetrically dominated reference points, but we do not see any evidence of a reference effect for symmetrically dominated reference points. Some of the existing models are mostly consistent with our data but lack predictive power. None of the models offers the particular predictions that our experiment suggests.

On one site, there are many approaches how to process input data, on the other hand thematic cartography also operates with many visualizing methods and techniques. Loss of accuracy of the results is more than expected because there are two phases (data processing during SDM and cartographic visualization) where the accuracy might be distorted.

      " Abstract: Brain tumors have become a leading cause of death around the globe. The main reason for this epidemic is the difficulty conducting a timely diagnosis of the tumor. Fortunately, magnetic resonance images (MRI) are utilized to diagnose tumors in most cases. The performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) depends on many factors (i.e., weight initialization, optimization, batches and epochs, learning rate, activation function, loss function, and network topology), data quality, and specific combinations of these model attributes. When we deal with a segmentation or classification problem, utilizing a single optimizer is considered weak testing or validity unless the decision of the selection of an optimizer is backed up by a strong argument. Therefore, optimizer selection processes are considered important to validate the usage of a single optimizer in order to attain these decision problems. In this paper, we provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of popular optimizers of CNN to benchmark the segmentation for improvement. In detail, we perform a comparative analysis of 10 different state-of-the-art gradient descent-based optimizers, namely Adaptive Gradient (Adagrad), Adaptive Delta (AdaDelta), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Momentum (Adam), Cyclic Learning Rate (CLR), Adaptive Max Pooling (Adamax), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMS Prop), Nesterov Adaptive Momentum (Nadam), and Nesterov accelerated gradient (NAG) for CNN.

      " Abstract: In his seminal work on fiscal federalism, Oates [Oates, W., 1972. Fiscal Federalism. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, New York, NY] addressed the so-called Decentralization Theorem, which states that, if such factors as scale economies and spillovers are left out of consideration, a decentralized system is always more efficient than a centralized system for supplying local public goods. Based on his analytical framework, we show that a decentralized system may at times be inferior in efficiency to a centralized system under a democratic decision rule (Proposition 2). An intuition for this result is that, under majority rule, a majority may choose an extreme policy in a local district that best matches its own preference but ignores the interests of minorities. In some cases, such disregard of minority taste may result in a considerable loss of efficiency. If instead some moderate policies are chosen through voting in an integrated constituency, then the interests of minorities could be better served to some extent. As a result, centralization would improve social welfare. © 2006.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background/Purpose: The risk of septicemia in postsplenectomy pediatric patients is approximately 2%. This risk is twice as great for children less than 4 years of age. In the first year of life this risk can be 30% or higher. Partial splenectomy is an alternative in patients with hemoglobinopathies. The authors attempt to assess the outcome of pediatric patients less than 4 years of age undergoing partial splenectomy using the Argon beam. Methods: In a tertiary care, university affiliated, dedicated children's hospital seven patients underwent partial splenectomy (PS) by the same surgeon from May 1993 to September 1995. The PS performed for trauma was excluded. Included were patients with hemoglobinopathies. Therefore, six patients were evaluated. Follow-up was from 6 months to 2 years. Pre- and postoperative blood transfusions, length of operation, estimated blood loss, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, perfusion, and function of remnant spleen were evaluated. Results: Indications for splenectomy included sequestration crisis and hypersplenism. Percent splenectomy ranged from 65% to 75%. Average hospital stay was 6.3 days. Postoperative splenic function, measured by Pitt count and radionuclide spleen scan, was normal. Postoperatively there were no systemic infections, overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis (OPSS), torsion of the splenic remnant, left upper quadrant fluid collections, or subphrenic abscesses. There were no deaths. Conclusions: Partial splenectomy is a safe and effective procedure in children less than 4 years of age with hemoglobinopathies. The procedure as described yields minimal blood loss and retains immune competence. Partial splenectomy greatly reduces, and in some cases eliminates, the need for blood transfusions. PS should be considered the procedure of choice in children less than 4 years of age with sickle cell anemia or β-thalassemia who require splenectomy.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Gene copy number analysis for some of the important molecules in lung tumorogenesis, such as MET, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), ligand for MET), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and paxillin (PXN), is likely to determine both the type of treatment and prognosis. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tumor tissue samples are an excellent source for determining key molecular changes in the OncoGenome; however, existing extraction procedures yield relatively poor quality genomic DNA fragments. Although FISH is the method of choice for determining amplification of a gene, a more rapid quantitative poly-merase chain reaction (qPCR) technique to determine gene copy number can be used when reasonably good quality genomic DNA is available. We report here a relatively rapid method based on microwave/chelex-100 treatment that gives rise to genomic DNA fragments ranging from 1 to 12 Kb and beyond, thereby attesting to its superior quality. Genomic PCR for Β-globin gene gave reliable and reproducible results. The number of steps for extracting the DNA was kept to a minimum, and instead of precipitating the DNA, we preserved the genomic DNA extracts so as to prevent a loss in DNA yield. We found the extracts to be stable and amenable to qPCR and mutational analysis. Using lung adenocarcinoma FFPE samples and cell lines derived from lung adenocarcinomas, we demonstrated that the gene copy number for MET in lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples was preferentially increased over EGFR, HGF, and PXN and that it positively correlated with a better prognosis. In contrast, the genomic DNA extracted from 25 NSCLC cell lines gave a relatively higher gene copy number for all four genes evaluated. Our results indicate that the microwave/chelex-100-based method yields good-quality genomic DNA extracts that can be used for complex DNA analysis, such as determination of gene copy number. In addition, our data demonstrated that the adenocarcinoma cell lines potentially evolved under ex vivo conditions, and therefore, in genetic studies it is imperative to use primary tumors for generalized conclusions about lung tumors. © 2009 by Begell House, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, peri-implant bone loss has recently emerged to be the focus of implant therapy. As such, researchers and clinicians are in need of finding predictable techniques to treat peri-implant bone loss and stop its progression. Materials and Methods: Literature search on the currently available treatment modalities was performed and a brief description of each modality was provided. Results: Numerous techniques have been proposed and none has been shown to be superior and effective in managing peri-implant bone loss. This may be because of the complex of etiological factors acting on the implant-supported prosthesis hence the treatment approach has to be individually tailored. Conclusion: Due to the lack of high-level clinical evidence on the management of peri-implant bone loss, the authors, through a literature review, attempt to suggest a decision tree or guideline, based on sound periodontal surgical principles, to aid clinicians in managing peri-implantitis associated bone loss. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs)such as the famous ResNet and DenseNet have achieved significant improvements in the field of automatic analysis of chest X-rays (CXRs). However, we observe that a wider network can combine characteristics from different DCNNs to improve the ability of object recognition compared with the single networks. In this paper, we focus on the cooperation and complementarity of dual asymmetric DCNNs and present a novel dual asymmetric feature learning network named DualCheXNet for multi-label thoracic disease classification in CXRs. Correspondingly, two asymmetric subnetworks based on the ResNet and DenseNet are combined to adaptively capture more discriminative features of different abnormalities from the raw CXRs. Specifically, the proposed method enables two different feature fusion operations, such as feature-level fusion (FLF)and decision-level fusion (DLF), which exactly form the complementary feature learning embedded in DualCheXNet. Moreover, an iterative training strategy is designed to integrate the loss contribution of the involved classifiers into a unified loss, and optimize the process of complementary features learning in an alternative way. Extensive experiments on the ChestX-ray14 dataset clearly substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared with the state-of-the-art baselines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Uncertainties in the rate and magnitude of sea-level rise (SLR) complicate decision making on coastal adaptation. Large uncertainty arises from potential ice mass-loss from Antarctica that could rapidly increase SLR in the second half of this century. The implications of SLR may be existential for a low-lying country like the Netherlands and warrant exploration of high-impact low-likelihood scenarios. To deal with uncertain SLR, the Netherlands has adopted an adaptive pathways plan. This paper analyzes the implications of storylines leading to extreme SLR for the current adaptive plan in the Netherlands, focusing on flood risk, fresh water resources, and coastline management. It further discusses implications for coastal adaptation in low-lying coastal zones considering timescales of adaptation including the decisions lifetime and lead-in time for preparation and implementation. We find that as sea levels rise faster and higher, sand nourishment volumes to maintain the Dutch coast may need to be up to 20 times larger than to date in 2100, storm surge barriers will need to close at increasing frequency until closed permanently, and intensified saltwater intrusion will reduce freshwater availability while the demand is rising. The expected lifetime of investments will reduce drastically. Consequently, step-wise adaptation needs to occur at an increasing frequency or with larger increments while there is still large SLR uncertainty with the risk of under- or overinvesting. Anticipating deeply uncertain, high SLR scenarios helps to enable timely adaptation and to appreciate the value of emission reduction and monitoring of the Antarctica contribution to SLR. © 2020 The Author(s).

      " Abstract: Objective. Previous neuroimaging studies have described altered activity in brain areas associated with reward processing following reward or punishment. This study examines the extent to which feedback-based experience of gain and loss is associated with electrophysiological correlates. Methods. Twenty-nine healthy participants used a gambling task that focused on actual nonpredictable gains and losses. During the task, an electroencephalography recording was performed in order to assess reward processing. Event-related potentials were analyzed when participants were receiving gain/loss feedback. Results. Event-related potentials revealed higher feedback-related negativity for both overall gain and loss compared with a neutral condition in fronto-centro-parietal electrodes. P3 potentials were significantly increased for high gains/losses compared to neutral and small gains/losses. Conclusion. These results indicate that the paradigm is suitable to evoke specific patterns of reward-related electrophysiological responses. The wavelet analysis showed that electroencephalography frequency variations depended on the amount of gains/losses. Significance.

Different schemes and modes of cooling the current leads with a superconducting region at the cold end are examined. Optimum helium flow rate and minimum power losses in an idealized and an actual cryogenic unit are defined. The calculations were made within the working temperature range of 5–18 K. The paper shows that the choice of the current lead cooling scheme allowing for minimum power losses depends on the relation between the temperatures of the superconducting device and of the superconducting transition in the superconducting region of the current lead.

      " Abstract: Background: There is great debate about the costs and benefits of technology-driven medical interventions such as instrumented lumbar fusion. With most analyses using charge data, the actual costs incurred by medical institutions performing these procedures are not well understood. The object of the current study was to examine the differences in hospital operating costs between open and minimally invasive spine surgery (MIS) during the perioperative period. Methods: Data were collected in the form of a prospective registry from a community hospital after specific Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. The analysis included consecutive adult patients being surgically treated for degenerative conditions of the lumbar spine, with either an MIS or open approach for two-level instrumented lumbar fusion. Patient outcomes and costs were collected for the perioperative period. Hospital operating costs were grouped by hospitalization/operative procedure, transfusions, reoperations, and residual events (health care interactions). Results: One hundred and one open posterior lumbar interbody fusion (Open group) and 109 MIS patients were treated primarily for stenosis coupled with instability (39.6% and 59.6%, respectively). Mean total hospital costs were $27,055.53 for the Open group and $24,320.16 for the MIS group. This represents a statistically significant cost savings of $2,825.37 (10.4% [95% confidence interval: $522.51-$5,128.23]) when utilizing MIS over traditional Open techniques. Additionally, residual events, complications, and blood transfusions were significantly more frequent in the Open group, compared to the MIS group. Conclusions/level of evidence: Utilizing minimally invasive techniques for instrumented spinal fusion results in decreased hospital operating costs compared to similar open procedures in the early perioperative period. Additionally, patient benefits of minimally invasive techniques include significantly less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, lower complication rate, and a lower number of residual events. Long-term outcome comparisons are needed to evaluate the efficacy of the two treatments.

      " Abstract: We report theoretical and experimental study of a p-i-n GalnAs photodiode integrated with inverted rib InP or GalnAsP waveguides grown on InP substrate. The coupling efficiency between the waveguide and the photodiode is calculated using the beam propagation method while the initial condition, i.e., the waveguide eigenmode is calculated by the finite difference method. The photodiode absorption is calculated as a function of key design parameters which are the waveguide dimensions, the wavelength and, in the case of heterostructure waveguide, the composition of the quaternary layer. Two classes of device application are foreseen: monitor photodiode and end line receiver. It is shown that at the wavelength of 1.55 μ the photodiode absorption can be maximized-up to 3000 dB/cm-by a proper choice of the waveguide composition and dimension. The length of the optimized receiver, with a 90-percent waveguide/detector coupling efficiency can be as short as 30 μ. The corresponding calculated p-n junction capacitance is 0.02 pF, and the device is suitable for integration with high speed optoelectronic circuits. A monitor photodiode has been realized using a homostructure InP waveguide. The photodiode and the waveguide are grown by a one-step chloride vapor phase epitaxy process. The measured photodiode characteristics compare well with the calculated ones.

However, stateof- the-art RF electromagnetic wireless systems are ineffective for communicating through-soil, due to extreme signal path losses from absorption and scattering in soil, even though the typical data requirements for such applications are modest, ranging from tens to hundreds of bps. In contrast, elephants, rodents and a wide variety of insects use acoustic waves for communicating through-soil, suggesting the viability of soil as a communication channel, and of acoustic waves as carriers. In this article, we demonstrate how soil can be used as a communication medium for wireless acoustic digital communication over distances up to 50 m at 20 bps data rates. By leveraging a physical model of the soil channel derived from its identified characteristics, then employing QPSK and OOK modulation and sparse decision feedback equalization schemes, and exploiting well-coupled and matched acoustic sources, wireless digital communication was successful in both laboratory and field experiments, illustrating the viability of sending application- specific data, ranging from binary sensor readings to low-resolution images. © 2002-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study investigates the complex multi-jurisdiction and multi-tier dimensions of local option sales taxes (LOSTs) in this setting. We estimate own-rate and cross-tier elasticities using data from 1993 to 2006 for Oklahoma municipalities and counties. Using a variety of panel data techniques including first differenced and random trends models, we show both are significant determinants of consumer spending patterns. Additionally, accounting for localized tax rate differentials reveals important nuances in the interpretation of cross-tier and own-rate elasticities. Our results suggest that municipal LOST revenues can be significantly affected by the rate setting decisions of parent counties as well as nearby regional retail centers. Therefore, the ability of municipal governments to control LOST revenues by varying their own LOST rate is affected by both vertical and horizontal fiscal spillovers.

A segmented multistrip coupler, or multistrip mode converter (MSMC), is described that converts SAW energy to LAW energy. The segmentation serves several purposes. If the LAW velocity is not precisely known, the MSMC can compensate somewhat for incorrect choice of grafting pitches in the SAW and LAW tracks. The segmentation also allows the structure to take less space on the substrate. A coupled-mode analysis of the MSMC and results on an experimental four-segment MSMC operating at 100 MHz with 25 percent bandwidth are presented. Al-though the MSMC should be capable of nearly complete energy transfer, this particular design was shorter than a full transfer length and had a conversion loss of about 5 dB.

It is not yet understood whether IS therapy may protect from the cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection or a temporary adjustment/withdrawal of IS therapy to restore the immune system may be necessary. We performed a systematic literature review to investigate the current management of IS therapy in KT recipients with COVID-1. Materials and Methods: Out of 71 articles published from 1 February 2020 until 30 October 2020, 554 KT recipients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. Results: Modifications of IS therapy were based on the clinical conditions. For asymptomatic patients or those with mild COVID-19 symptoms, a “wait and see approach” was mostly used; a suspension of antimetabolites drugs (347/461, 75.27%) or mTOR inhibitors (38/48, 79.2%) was adopted in the majority of patients with symptomatic COVID-19 infections. For CNIs, the most frequent attitude was their maintenance (243/502, 48.4%) or dose-reduction (99/502, 19.72%) in patients asymptomatic or with mild COVID-19 symptoms, while drug withdrawal was the preferred choice in severely symptomatic patients (160/450, 31.87%). A discontinuation of all IS drugs was used only in severely symptomatic COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. Renal function remained stable in 422(76.17%) recipients, while 49(8.84%) patients experienced graft loss. Eight (1.44%) patients experienced a worsening of renal function. The overall mortality was 21.84%, and 53(9.56%) patients died with functioning grafts. Conclusion: A tailored approach to the patient has been the preferred strategy for the management of IS therapy in KT recipients, taking into account the clinical conditions of patients and the potential interactions between IS and antiviral drugs, in the attempt to balance the risks of COVID-19-related complications and those due to rejection or graft loss. © 2021 by the authors.

      " Abstract: The direct physical loss from a tornado is one possible factor in considering resilience goals for a community. Estimating such loss has historically been achieved either through analysis of empirical data from historical events meant to then match future hypothetical events or through a cost analysis based on a building's damage state. These approaches provide a solid baseline for estimating loss from wind events; however, gathering data from historical events may assume all locations are the same, while analyses based solely on the building damage state may not include a building's contents. This study builds on work previously established in determining loss from building damage state fragilities, by including a loss to the building's interior (including contents) based on Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) HAZUS equations. The approach laid out in this paper is then validated, showing what is deemed an acceptable level of accuracy, using the May 22, 2011 Joplin tornado that devastated the local community. Once validated, the same tornado path is relocated in different directions, ultimately crossing most of city of Joplin in four additional hypothetical scenarios. The results of both hindcasting the 2011 Joplin tornado and its hypothetical track variations show commercial (nonresidential) type buildings as key in contributing to the direct physical loss of a wind event.

In alignment with the goals of the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) Best Evidence Consensus (BEC) on the use of biologic mediators in contemporary clinical practice, the aim of this sytematic review was to evaluate the effect of biologic agents, specifically autogenous blood-dervied products (ABPs), enamel matrix derivative (EMD) and recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB), on the regenerative outcomes of infrabony defects. Methods: A detailed systematic search was conducted to identify eligible randomized control trials (RCTs) reporting the outcomes of periodontal regenerative therapy using biologics for the treatment of infrabony defects. A frequentist mixed-modeling approach to network meta-analysis (NMA), characterized by the assessment of three individual components for the treatment of an infrabony defect (the bone graft material [BG], the biologic agent, the application of a barrier membrane) was performed to evaluate and compare the relative efficacy of the different components, on the outcomes of different therapeutic modalities of periodontal regeneration. Results: A total of 153 eligible RCTs were included, with 150 studies contributing to the NMA. The quantitative analysis showed that the addition of biologic agents to bone graft significantly improves the clinical and radiographic outcomes, as compared to BG and flap procedures alone. Barrier membranes enhanced the regenerative outcomes of BG but did not provide further benefits in combination with biologics. The type of BG (autogenous, allogeneic, xenogeneic or alloplastic) and the biologic agent (EMD, platelet-rich fibrin [PRF], platelet-rich plasma [PRP] or rhPDGF-BB) played a significant role on the final outcomes of infrabony defects. Allogeneic and xenogeneic BGs exhibited statistically significantly superior clinical gain than synthetic and autogenous BGs (p < 0.05 in all the comparisons), while rhPDGF-BB and PRF demonstrated significantly higher stability of the gingival margin (p < 0.01) and radiographic bone fill/gain (p < 0.05), together with greater, although not statistically significant, clinical attachment level gain and pocket depth reduction, than EMD and PRP. Overall, rhPDGF-BB exhibited the largest effect size for most parameters, including clinical attachment level gain, pocket depth reduction, less gingival recession and radiographic linear bone gain. Considering the relatively high number of trials presenting an unclear or high risk of bias, the strength of recommendation supporting the use of PRP was judged weak, while the recommendation for EMD, PRF and rhPDGF-BB was deemed in favor. Conclusions: Biologics enhance the outcomes of periodontal regenerative therapy. Combination therapies involving BGs + biologics or BGs + barrier membrane demonstrated to be superior to monotherapies. The choice of the type of BG and biologic agent seems to have significant impact on the clinical and radiographic outcomes of infrabony defects. © 2022 American Academy of Periodontology.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We previously developed an individual-based model evaluating the bio-economic efficiency of fishing vessel movements from recent high resolution spatial fishery data. The assumption was constant underlying resource availability. Now, an advanced version considers the underlying size-based dynamics of the targeted stocks for Danish and German vessels harvesting the North Sea and Baltic Sea fish stocks. The stochastic fishing process is specific to the vessel catching power and to the encountered population abundances, based on disaggregated research survey data. The impact of the effort displacement on the fish stocks and the vessels' economic consequences were evaluated by simulating individual choices of vessel speed, fishing grounds, and ports. Some scenarios led to increased energy efficiency and profit while others such as fishing closures or fishermen optimization sometimes lowered the revenue by altering the spatiotemporal effort allocation. On an individual scale, the simulations led to gains and losses due to either the interactions between vessels or to the alteration of individual patterns. We demonstrate that integrating the spatial activity of vessels and fish abundance dynamics allow for more realistic predictions of fishermen behaviour, profits, and stock abundance.\u001b[0m :\n",

DECISION: An anonymous self-questionnaire was collected transversally from women aged 18 to 35 years. The exposed group was composed of elite female athletes; the non-exposed group was made up of women in the same age range accepting to answer the questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 157 answers from elite athletes and 426 from control subjects were available for analysis. Urinary incontinence prevalence was 28% for athletes and 9.8% for control subjects (p = .001). There was no significant difference in the relative prevalence of SUI between the athletes and control subjects. Athletes reported urine loss more frequently during the second part of the training session (p < 0.0003), and the second part of competition (p < 0.05). Urinary incontinence prevalence was 9.87% in physically-active control subjects versus 9.84% in sedentary control subjects (NS). Even a small quantity of urine loss was felt to be embarrassing. Most incontinent women did not dare to speak of their condition to anybody. CONCLUSIONS: There is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes.

      " Abstract: Background: Most extra-articular metacarpal fractures can be managed nonoperatively. While the conventional wisdom is that the metacarpophalangeal joint should be immobilized in a position of flexion, alternative methods for cast immobilization have been described. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate three methods of closed treatment; specifically, we investigated whether the position of immobilization of the metacarpophalangeal joint or the absence of a range of motion of the interphalangeal joints affected the short-term outcome or fracture alignment. Methods: Between November 2000 and April 2004, extra-articular metacarpal fractures were immobilized for five weeks in one of three ways: with the metacarpophalangeal joints in flexion and full interphalangeal joint motion permitted (Group 1); with the metacarpophalangeal joints in extension and full interphalangeal joint motion permitted (Group 2); and with the metacarpophalangeal joints in flexion, the interphalangeal joints in extension, and no interphalangeal joint motion permitted (Group 3). Radiographs and the range of motion were evaluated at five weeks after application of the cast, and the range of motion and grip strength were assessed at nine weeks. Results: Two hundred and sixty-three patients met the inclusion criteria. At five weeks, there was no difference among the treatment methods with regard to the range of motion or the maintenance of fracture reduction. At nine weeks, there was no significant difference with regard to the range of motion or grip strength. Conclusions: When immobilization was discontinued by five weeks, the position of the metacarpophalangeal joints and the absence or presence of interphalangeal joint motion during the immobilization had little effect on motion, grip strength, or fracture alignment. This finding contradicts the conventional teaching that the metacarpophalangeal joint must be immobilized in flexion to prevent long-term loss of joint extension. Patient comfort, ease of application, and the surgeon's familiarity with the technique should influence the choice of immobilization. Level of Evidence: Therapeutic Level III.

We refrain from making any stochastic assumptions on the generation of the underlying desired signal and try to achieve uniformly good performance for any deterministic and arbitrary individual signal. We investigate this problem in a competitive framework, where we construct algorithms that perform as well as the best algorithm in a competing class of algorithms for each desired signal. Here, the best algorithm in the competition class can be tuned to the underlying desired clean signal even before processing any of the data.

      " Abstract: The use of detailed meteorological data with sailing software, in conjunction with sailing the Ma'agan Mikhael II replica ship, has engendered the development of a method for examining maritime mobility of single-masted square sail Mediterranean merchantmen in the Graeco-Roman period, with the initial objective of mapping direct, open sea, return sailing routes from the Levant that a priori lie contrary to the prevailing wind. Many quantitative works have used averaged winds as input, and evaluated sailing passages based on climatological averages, losing information on the intra- and inter-diurnal variability of the winds. Thus their sole measure of mobility has been a representation of sailing speed on direct crossings. Moreover, these studies have not considered the difference between physical and practical mobility, the latter driven by human factors. For instance, the choice of whether to sail, or wait for better conditions. The proposed method uses climatological resources at high spatial and temporal resolutions, with the premise that using high-resolution data reveals the recurring wind variabilities and patterns that are key to mobility, especially on routes lying contrary to the prevailing winds. The method generated a large set of over 5400 simulated sailing outcomes for each route segment, permitting well-established statistical analysis. Inclusion of criteria-based human factors of the mariners of the period provides a measure of mobility, representing not only sailing speed, but also waiting time, and the probability of conducting a feasible passage at a given time of the year. This new method provides deeper insight into maritime mobility and the understanding of seafaring in the Mediterranean, and is applicable to numerous scenarios, providing a practical and improved measure of maritime mobility. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

The choice of alcohols as the materials of the investigation is also related to the fact that in the rectification of the methanol feedstock the recovered methanol-fusel oil-water fraction, containing up to 33% water, 5% ethanol, and up to 13% higher alcohols, is burned, i. e. , is irretrievably lost for industry, while this valuable chemical raw material can be used for formaldehyde synthesis. For all the investigated impurities, the yields of CO//2 and CH//2O and the selectivity of the process in relation to temperature passed through a maximum at 923-973 degree K. Elevation of the temperature to 1023 degree K increased the content of CO and H//2 in the waste gases, which indicates predominant decomposition of formaldehyde.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Bird nests often consist of stronger materials to maintain nest structure and a softer layer of lining materials to reduce heat loss. We studied whether early learning affected the use of nest materials by cross-fostering between two tit species with similar breeding ecology, the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus, and the great tit, Parus major, in a woodland area provided with nestboxes in Norway. In both species, only the female builds the nest. From previous studies, we know that early social learning affects a number of traits in these birds, including song repertoire, mate choice, foraging behaviour and nest site choice. Nests of the two species are similar but blue tits use more feathers than great tits. This was confirmed in the present study; however, female blue tits raised by great tit foster parents also supplied their nest with feathers, and female great tits raised by blue tits used few feathers. The only treatment effect was that fewer feathers were found in nests of cross-fostered females in both species than in nests of controls. This may have been caused by time and energetic constraints during nest building because cross-fostered birds seemed to forage less efficiently than controls. The amount of hair was slightly greater in blue tits than in great tits, but it was not affected by the cross-fostering either. We conclude that no cultural transmission was found in the use of lining materials in the nest of the two species, perhaps because young birds hatch after their parents have stopped constructing the nest. © 2020 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: In this report, we describe challenges we encountered in the clinical management of a patient with hypoparathyroidism who had previously undergone a bariatric procedure. Case presentation: We report the case of a 38-year-old Caucasian woman who had undergone a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure for treatment of obesity. She also had a past history of right lobectomy to treat a benign thyroid nodule. Another thyroid nodule was diagnosed after her bariatric surgery, so a new thyroid surgery was performed. Permanent hypoparathyroidism occurred after the second thyroid surgery. A Roux-en-Y gastric bypass resulted in important weight loss, but the preferential site of calcium absorption was bypassed. The lack of endogenous parathyroid hormone secretion due to post-surgical hypoparathyroidism abolished the physiological mechanism that compensates the reduced calcium absorption, which was a challenge for us to overcome. In this report, we describe our clinical therapeutic choices to maintain normocalcemia and normophosphatemia in this patient. Higher doses of exogenous calcium citrate, calcitriol and cholecalciferol were used, but hypocalcemia was still present. To improve Vitamin D absorption with resultant improvement of calcium homeostasis, we speculated that adding pancrelipase to meals would increase lipid absorption and possibly fat-soluble vitamins, including Vitamin D. Only after the addition of pancrelipase did the patient improve without weight regain according to clinical and laboratory assessments. Conclusion: The use of exogenous pancreatic enzymes improved calcium homeostasis in this bariatric patient. The role of these enzymes on Vitamin D absorption and subsequent rise in calcium levels in hypoparathyroid patients who undergo bariatric procedures need further investigation. © 2014 Panazzolo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: One of the best-researched anomalies in behavioral sciences is loss aversion, but with strong study variations and no systematic explanations thereof. The aim here was to introduce psychophysiological correlates for loss aversion to improve behavioral predictability. In an endowment experiment, a loss versus gain framing was implemented for a virtue versus a vice product. In addition to the classical price elicitation, an area of indifference and individual price reactions were examined, while emotional arousal as skin conductance levels were continuously measured. Furthermore, various heterogeneity measures for emotions and product experience evaluations were applied directly after the purchasing decision or as a more general personality measure at the end of the study. Results show fundamental regularities of product and frame on the price or the size of indifference. Physiologically measured emotional arousal further supports the dependence of loss aversion. Vice products and a loss frame increase emotional arousal and the consumer purchase price indifference. Reported emotions, aggregated as personality factors, can partially explain the observed heterogeneity in purchase price levels and price indifferences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Findings from previous studies of individual decision-making behavior predict that losses will loom larger than gains. It is less clear, however, if this loss aversion applies to the way in which individuals attribute value to the gains and losses of others, or if it is robust across a broad spectrum of policy and management decision contexts. Consistent with previous work, the results from a series of experiments reported here revealed that subjects exhibited loss aversion when evaluating their own financial gains and losses. The presence of loss aversion was also confirmed for the way in which individuals attribute value to the financial gains and losses of others. However, similar evaluations within social and environmental contexts did not exhibit loss aversion. In addition, research subjects expected that individuals who were unknown to them would significantly undervalue the subjects' own losses across all contexts. The implications of these findings for risk-based policy and management are many. Specifically, they warrant caution when relying upon loss aversion to explain or predict the reaction of affected individuals to risk-based decisions that involve moral or protected values. The findings also suggest that motivational biases may lead decisionmakers to assume that their attitudes and beliefs are common among those affected by a decision, while those affected may expect unfamiliar others to be unable to identify and act in accordance with shared values. © 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Planning initiative on the part of individual groups and communities within urban areas has been made necessary by the increasing bureaucratization and technical basis of decisions in current urban society. The efforts of advocate planners to represent these groups are made difficult because of their frequent lack of homogeneity, community feeling, and common interests in action. The treatment of local areas as “communities” of homogeneous interests can result in severe damage to the interest of their weakest inhabitants. Further, it is difficult to draw low-income families into the framework of planning, and to evoke their concern for the planning issues normally posed by the local establishment. Thus it is necessary to carefully generate viable issues in the work and maintain a consciousness of the interrelation of technical and political matters at all levels. The advocate planner's need to evoke and formulate issues maizes him dangerously similar to other manipulators of the poor's interests. One of the most difficult kinds of issues is the type like transportation which, although generated at the community level, must be studied and argued at the metropolitan scale with the consequent loss of a clearly identified client group.

The research covered 16 voluntary migrants. A psychological interview and observation were used. Attempts were made to explain the fear of death and the related behaviours of migrants on the basis of two theories: sensation seeking theory by M. Zuckerman and terror management theory by Greenberg, Pyszczynski and Solomon. It turned out that the subjects rarely considered the risk of losing health or life on their way to the EU, and the level of fear of death was low, especially in men. The existence of relationships between the level of anxiety and sensation seeking, self-esteem and worldview has been noticed. The level of fear in women can be explained by their age, life experience, way of making decisions and awareness of dangers along the route to the UE. Women thought about passing away more often because they encountered the death of their relatives more often. Men often made decisions on an impulse. The contemplating death, second aspect of the thanatological attitude was absent in them. They had higher self-esteem than women, a more stable culture worldview, and a higher sensation seeking and propensity for risky behavior.

Despite its relative frequency, there remains significant heterogeneity in both operative management and follow-up between centers and a relative paucity of long-term outcome data in the literature. At the authors’ institution, families of children presenting with SC are offered the following options: 1) conservative management with ophthalmic surveillance, 2) minimally invasive surgery at < 6 months of age (spring-assisted cranioplasty [SAC]) or 3) calvarial vault remodeling at any age (CVR). The authors reviewed outcomes for all children presenting with SC during a 5-year period, regardless of the treatment received. METHODS Consecutive children born between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2012, presenting with SC were identified, and detailed chart reviews were undertaken. Demographic, surgical, perioperative, head shape, scar, and neurodevelopmental (behavioral, education, speech, and language) data were analyzed. The cohort was divided by type of surgery (none, SAC, or CVR) and by age at surgery (early, defined as ≤ 6 months; or late, defined as > 6 months) for comparison purposes. RESULTS A total of 167 children were identified, 129 boys and 38 girls, with a median age at presentation of 5.0 (range 0.4–135) months. Three families opted for conservative management. Of the 164 children who underwent surgery, 83 underwent SAC, 76 underwent CVR, and 5 underwent a “hybrid” procedure (CVR with springs). At a median age of 7.0 (range 0.5–12.3) years, there was no significant difference in concerns regarding head shape, scar, or neurodevelopmental outcomes between the early and late intervention groups over all procedures performed, or between the early or late SAC and CVR cohorts. There were more head shape concerns in the SAC group than in the CVR group overall (25.7% vs 11.8%, respectively; p = 0.026), although most of these concerns were minor and did not require revision. CONCLUSIONS In this cohort, regardless of operative intervention and timing of intervention, infants achieved similar neurodevelopmental outcomes. Minimally invasive surgery (SAC) appears to result in less complete correction of head shape than CVR, but this may be balanced by advantages in reduced operative time, hospitalization, and blood loss. SAC was equal to CVR in neuropsychological outcomes. ©AANS 2023, except where prohibited by US copyright law.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: Dental implants are widely accepted in the dental community. Although several studies have reported high dental implant survival rates, complications can still occur. Implant failure is associated with different risk factors, including implant length and diameter. However, no clear consensus has yet been reached. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different risk factors associated with implant failure. Methods: This study included patients who received dental implants at Kyoto University Hospital. The inclusion criteria were dental implants placed between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2022. Data on patient- and implant-related variables were collected. We used a marginal Cox proportional hazards models to investigate the association between the potential factors and implant failure. Results: This study included 147 patients who received 479 dental implants. Eleven of the 147 patients experienced implant failure, whereas 17 of the 479 implants failed. The cumulative survival rate of dental implants at the final time point was 95.3%. Multivariable marginal Cox analysis showed suggestive evidence that implant length (<10 mm) greatly increased the risk of implant failure compared with implant length (≥10 mm) (reference: <10 mm, hazard ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval, 0.01–0.34; p = 0.001). Conclusions: A cumulative survival rate comparable to that reported in other studies was achieved over prolonged periods of time. Although implant failure is multifactorial and implant length is only one of many factors contributing to implant loss, clinicians must be aware of the potential influence of implant length and make treatment decisions. © 2024 Asian AOMS, ASOMP, JSOP, JSOMS, JSOM, and JAMI\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Single-segment great saphenous vein (SSGSV) remains the conduit of choice for femoral to below-knee popliteal (FBK) surgical revascularization. The purpose of this study was to determine the optimal conduit in patients with inadequate SSGSV. Methods: This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained vascular registry. Patients underwent FBK bypass with alternative vein (AV; arm vein, spliced GSV, or composite vein) or prosthetic conduit (PC). Results: From January 1995 to June 2010, 83 patients had unusable SSGSV for FBK popliteal reconstruction. Thirty-three patients had an AV conduit and 50 had PC. The AV group was a lower median age than the PC group (69 vs 75 years). The two groups were otherwise similar in comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus (57.6% vs 58.0%; P >.99), smoking (15.2% vs 32.0%; P =.12), and hemodialysis (3% vs 12%; P =.23). The groups were similar in baseline characteristics such as limb salvage as indication (93.9% vs 86.0%; P =.31), mean runoff score (5.2 vs 4.6; P =.39), and prior ipsilateral bypass attempts (18.2% vs 18.0%; P >.99). The AV and PC groups were also similar in 30-day mortality (6.1% vs 4.0%; P >.99) and wound infection rates (6.1% vs 6.0%; P >.99). PC patients were more likely to be discharged on Coumadin (Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) than AV patients (62.0% vs 27.3%; P =.002). Seventeen of the 50 PC patients (34%) had a distal anastomotic vein cuff. A log-rank test comparison of 5-year outcomes for the AV and PC groups found no significant difference in primary patency (55.3% ± 9.9% vs 51.9% ± 10.8%; P =.82), assisted primary patency (68.8% ± 9.6% vs 54.0% ± 11.0%; P =.45), secondary patency (68.4% ± 9.6% vs 63.7% ± 10.4% for PC; P =.82), or limb salvage rates (96.2% ± 3.8% vs 81.1% ± 8.1%; P =.19). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no association between conduit type and loss of patency or limb. The factors most predictive of primary patency loss were limb salvage as the indication for surgery (hazard ratio [HR], 4.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.65-10.9; P =.003) and current hemodialysis (HR, 3.51; 95% CI, 1.08-11.4; P =.037). The most predictive factor of limb loss was current hemodialysis (HR, 7.02; 95% CI, 1.13-43.4; P =.036). Conclusions: For patients with inadequate SSGSV, PCs, with varying degrees of medical and surgical adjuncts, appear comparable to AV sources in graft patency for below-knee popliteal bypass targets. This observation is tempered by the small cohort sample size of this single-institutional analysis. Critical limb ischemia as the operative indication and current hemodialysis predict impaired patency, and hemodialysis is associated with limb loss. © 2012 Society for Vascular Surgery.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: New web technologies have encouraged the deployment of various network applications that are rich with multimedia and real-time services. These services demand stringent requirements are defined through Quality of Service (QoS) parameters such as delay, jitter, loss, etc. To guarantee the delivery of these services QoS routing algorithms that deal with multiple metrics are needed. Unfortunately, QoS routing with multiple metrics is considered an NP-complete problem that cannot be solved by a simple algorithm. This paper proposes three source based QoS routing algorithms that find the optimal path from the service provider to the user that best satisfies the QoS requirements for a particular service. The three algorithms use the same filtering technique to prune all the paths that do not meet the requirements which solves the complexity of NP-complete problem. Next, each of the three algorithms integrates a different Multiple Criteria Decision Making method to select one of the paths that have resulted from the route filtering technique. The three decision making methods used are the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), and Kepner-Tregoe KT. Results show that the algorithms find a path using multiple constraints with a high ability to handle multimedia and real-time applications. Copyright © 2010, IGI Global.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: The worldwide increase in morbidly obese patients with complex hernia raises controversies in the choice of the appropriate treatment timing: synchronous bariatric and abdominal wall surgery versus delayed abdominal wall surgery. We report an innovative tailored surgical treatment carried out at our Institution. Patient and Methods: The approach provided the injection, 6 weeks before surgery, of 500 IU of botulinum toxin A on either side of the large abdominal wall muscles. Four weeks before surgery, pneumoperitoneum was inducted and out-patient daily sessions of progressive insufflation with ambient air were then carried out. Surgery was scheduled 48 days after botulinum injection. Sleeve gastrectomy and simultaneous posterior component separation with transversus abdominis release were performed. Two prosthetic meshes were placed sublay. Postoperative superficial surgical site infection was successfully treated with negative pressure wound therapy. At a 1-year follow-up, no hernia recurrence was recorded while total body weight loss was 31%. Discussion: A delay in ventral hernia repair could worsen the quality of life of morbidly obese patients. In such high-risk patients, the choice of the best surgical strategy remains controversial. There is great concern in performing bariatric surgery simultaneously to hernia repair, although there is lack of evidence on which is the ideal treatment modality. Conclusion: Synchronous bariatric surgery and complex ventral hernia repair should be approached in high-volume centres where a consolidated experience of multidisciplinary teamwork is available.

      " Abstract: Tourism is the economic sector most heavily influenced by COVID-19, and it has suffered unprecedented losses. The competitiveness and resilience of the tourism industry have recently become a topic of great concern for global stakeholders. A series of ambitious recovery strategies have been announced by countries to rebuild the tourism industry, that aim to make “smokeless industry” more resilient and sustainable. The objective of this study is to evaluate and rank the effectiveness of nine recovery strategies in the post-COVID-19 period for Vietnam’s tourism industry. A combined model of the Best–Worst Method (BWM) and the Group Best Worst Method (GBWM), an efficient tool using the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, is used to rank the tourism solutions. The assessment process is carried out by six stakeholder groups considered decision makers, including tourism operators, enterprises, scholars, employees, residents, and tourists. In the context of Vietnam, the most influential tourism recovery strategy is using innovative tourism business models (ST2), which is a solid step forward in utilizing potential resources, meeting current tourism needs, and adapting to natural changes. The model results reflect that the tourism model’s restructuring is necessary to provide new types of experiences and entertainment suitable for the new tourism context. The findings illustrate that the priority of strategies depends on the perception of decision-makers, levels of involvement in the tourism industry, and local conditions. The study has contributed a theoretical framework for tourism recovery solutions and decision support in the post-pandemic stage. The model can be applied to other countries worldwide in improving tourism performance or assisting in decision-making for similar issues. © 2023 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

It is necessary to understand the welfare change of the cotton chain under this shock of financial crisis in order for relevant policy decisions to be made. The purpose of this paper is to measure the welfare change of all the consumers, producers, circulation and farmers in the cotton supply chain under the shock of financial crisis. Design/methodology/approach - There is no existing mature method to calculate the welfare change of a special supply chain, such as the cotton supply chain. The method most used in such situations is the equilibrium displacement model, created by Muth, and developed by Gardner. Findings - The financial crisis has had important impacts on China cotton industry. Farmers' losses are bigger than people estimate. Circulation link's loss is a little lower than cotton farmers'. Producers' loss is far lower than circulation and cotton farmers. Consumers' loss is the biggest loss in the whole cotton supply chain: however, some of these are foreign consumers - especially foreign wholesalers and retailers.

However, the metalens design in the visible range stays quite challenging due to the smaller nanostructuring scale and the limited choice of lossless CMOS-compatible materials. We develop a simple yet efficient design of a polarization-independent, broadband metalens suitable for many CMOS-compatible fabrication techniques and materials and implement it for the visible spectral range using niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5). The produced metalens demonstrates high transmittance and focusing ability as well as a large depth of focus, which makes it a promising solution for a new generation of silicon photomultiplier photodetectors with reduced fill factor impact on the performance and reduced electron-hole generation regions, which altogether potentially leads to improved photodetection efficiency and other characteristics.  © 2020 Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

Subjects and Methods: This retrospective study included 161 cases of cartilage myringoplasties collected over an 11-year period (2010-2020). Of the 161 cases, the etiology of the tympanic perforations was simple chronic otitis media in 154 (95.65%) ears and traumatic in 7 (4.35%) ears. The mean preoperative Rinne was 26.20±7.05 dB. The most commonly used approach was retroauricular, and the common graft material was tragal or conqual cartilage. Results: After the follow-up period (mean:15 months), the anatomical success rate was 93.2%; there were nine cases of reperforation, of which three were reoperated with a good final result. The hearing success rate (residual Rinne ≤20 dB) was 91.9% with an average gain of 11.48±8.62 dB. The only factor significantly influencing the anatomical outcome was the history of chronic rhinosinusitis. In univariate studies, several factors influencing the functional result were revealed; the only one retained after elimination of bias was the anatomical result. Conclusions: We recommend cartilage as the material of choice for myringoplasties as it has been shown to be resistant to predictive factors of failure after tympanic repair surgery.

During the undergraduate course in paediatrics, this knowledge decay is seen between the first (4th semester) and second (8th semester) clinical posting with wasting of time and faculty resources in reinforcement of this acquired knowledge again. Objectives: To identify the extent and reasons for the knowledge decay in undergraduate medical education in paediatrics. Method: Mixed method comparative study was conducted among 8th semester students posted in Department of Paediatrics. The end of posting multiple choice questions (MCQ) test in 4th semester was re-administered as a pre-test in 8th semester along with open ended questions for their reasons. The marks obtained in both tests were compared and analysed using the paired t-test. Results: The marks of 225 students were compared between the 2 posting sessions. Decay of acquired knowledge was found to be statistically significant among all sections of paediatrics, with the most decay being in the knowledge of anthropometry and least decay in infectious diseases and haematology. The long gap between the two postings, lack of theory knowledge and paediatrics not being an examination subject in the second year, were the reasons given for the decay. Conclusions: Significant loss of acquired knowledge was found in paediatrics between 4th and 8th semester clinical postings after initial good acquisition.

We show two constructions of n-evasive ABM-LTFs. The first one is based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption, and the second one is from chameleon hash functions and ABN-LTFs. Both of the constructions are based on reasonable assumptions with tight security reductions. Similar to ABN-LTFs and ABM-LTFs, n-evasive ABM-LTFs can be employed to construct indistinguishability-based selective opening chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption (PKE) schemes and may have other applications in cryptography. The instantiation of n-evasive ABM-LTFs can be based on the well-known assumption, for example, DCR, and the security reduction is much tighter than that of ABM-LTFs.

      " Abstract: Objectives: The high revision rates of the DePuy Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) and the DePuy ASR XL (the total hip arthroplasty (THA) version) have led to questions over the viability of metalonmetal (MoM) hip joints. Some designs of MoM hip joint do, however, have reasonable mid-term performance when implanted in appropriate patients. Investigations into the reasons for implant failure are important to offer help with the choice of implants and direction for future implant designs. One way to assess the performance of explanted hip prostheses is to measure the wear (in terms of material loss) on the joint surfaces. Methods: In this study, a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) was used to measure the wear on five failed cementless Biomet Magnum/ReCap/Taperloc large head MoM THAs, along with one Biomet ReCap resurfacing joint. Surface roughness measurements were also taken. The reason for revision of these implants was pain and/or adverse reaction to metal debris (ARMD) and/or elevated blood metal ion levels. Results: The mean wear rate of the articulating surfaces of the heads and acetabular components of all six joints tested was found to be 6.1 mm3/year (4.1 to 7.6). The mean wear rate of the femoral head tapers of the five THAs was 0.054 mm3/year (0.021 to 0.128) with a mean maximum wear depth of 5.7 μm (4.3 to 8.5). Conclusion: Although the taper wear was relatively low, the wear from the articulating surfaces was sufficient to provide concern and was potentially large enough to have been the cause of failure of these joints. The authors believe that patients implanted with the ReCap system, whether the resurfacing prosthesis or the THA, should be closely monitored. © 2017 Scholes et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Sense of agency, the feeling of having control over one’s actions, is modulated by whether one’s choices lead to desired or undesired outcomes. Learning similarly depends on outcome values from previous experience. In the current study, we evaluate a possible link between the sense of agency and learning, by investigating how intentional binding, an implicit measure of agency, changes during a probabilistic learning task. In two experiments, we show increased intentional binding in trials that follow losses, compared with trials that follow wins. Experiment 1 demonstrated that this post-error agency boost (PEAB) effect is rule-specific, as it did not occur if the trial following an error involved different action–outcome contingencies. Furthermore, PEAB was not modulated by the type of outcome presentation (monetary vs. affective). Experiment 2 showed that the PEAB effect can also occur when the current action involves a forced (as opposed to free) choice, but only when the previous, loss-provoking action was chosen freely. Thus, PEAB occurs when current actions are informed by outcomes of one’s own previous action choices. Electroencephalography (EEG) data linked these effects to two event-related potential components, namely, the Feedback Related Negativity and the P300. Taken together, these results support the notion that PEAB reflects an adaptive property of human sense of agency, facilitating effective learning about the action–outcome structure of a specific task, to optimise future performance. By clarifying the conditions for enhancing the sense of agency through learning, this work adds to our understanding of human learning and agency. © Experimental Psychology Society 2020.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: As the demand for power reliability keeps rising in modern society, the integration of energy storage systems into power networks increases at an unprecedented rate. Meanwhile, reliability analysis and enhancement of a power network attracts more and more attention. This paper explores the impact of four different energy management strategies (EMSs) on the reliability of microgrids, which play an important role in future distribution networks. The reliability performance is analysed on different levels, including converter interfaces and battery storage units on device level as well as power supply reliability on system level. The numerical analysis has shown that the employed EMS can remarkably affect the reliability indices of the system.

      " Abstract: Flow control, which prevents data loss, has been an important function in data communications. Today, high-speed networks are adopting flow control, and one such scheme has recently been adopted by ATM. This paper investigates the design of a rate-based scheme based on receiver buffer occupancy. The analytical model for the rate-based scheme can exhibit not only the effect of rate-based flow control, but also window-based flow control and a combination of both. The proposed rate decision algorithm is shown to produce performance gains for both buffer utilization and throughput.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Cancer diagnosis influences the choices that patients make regarding current and future labor market activity. These choices have implications for governments based on resulting changes in taxes paid and benefits received. In this analysis we explore how human growth receptor 2 (HER2)-positive residual invasive breast cancer and different treatments influence government accounts excluding health costs. Methods: HER2-positive early breast cancer (eBC) health states from a published disease model were used to establish likelihood of working and wage impact at different stages of disease. The indirect productivity losses for an average woman aged 49 years were translated into fiscal consequences to government by applying an established government perspective-modeling framework. The fiscal projections (discounted) include gross tax revenue by disease stage, government transfer costs related to time off work and early retirement,and net fiscal balance (e.g., gross taxes—transfers) in three countries Canada, Portugal, and Brazil. Results: The net fiscal balance in Canada for a healthy woman was C$109,551 compared with a HER2-positive eBC woman treated with trastuzumab emtansine (C$69,767) or trastuzumab (C$62,971). A similar pattern was observed in the three countries but reflecting the overall tax burden in each country, labor force activity, and available public benefits. Age at diagnosis was an important determinant of the likely net fiscal balance, as this influences the remaining working years. Discussion: Women diagnosed with HER2-positive eBC were estimated to pay less lifetime gross taxes and receive more in sickness benefits compared with healthy women. Treatments that improve outcomes are likely to offer fiscal gains for government from improved work force participation. © The Author(s) 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, the occurrence of previously undiagnosed diseases can be encountered during bariatric operations. The work has been reported in line with the SCARE criteria. Case presentation This is the case of a 54 year old morbidly obese female, presenting to our hospital for a laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. During her procedure, it was discovered that she has an accessory spleen on the fundus of her stomach. The decision was made to resect it with the specimen of the stomach for histopathalogical examination. Conclusion Incidental findings during routine bariatric surgery are a common occurance, and therefore prompt and effective intra-op management is key to the prognosis of the patient.

This paper studies the impact of repeating transactions on the decisions and performances of the service supply chain under two operational modes: proprietary mode and agent mode. We show that under both modes, repeating transactions over and over again does increase the profits of platform service supply chain members. The number of periods and the depreciation rate of capacity in uence the gap between decentralized and centralized supply chains only under agent mode but not under proprietary mode. In addition, compared with that under proprietary mode, agent mode yields a greater expected profit for the retailer and a lower expected profit for the supplier, and the increased expected profit of the retailer compensates for the expected profit loss of the supplier. Furthermore, we present a modified new proprietary mode and find that it can yield a greater expected profit for the whole supply chain under agent mode within certain regions.

To prevent any accidental loss or harm to human life and property, a safety risk assessment method is needed to perform the continuous risk assessment of mines. Based on the requirements of mine safety evaluation, this paper proposes the Pb-Zn mine safety risk evaluation model based on the fuzzy-grey correlation analysis method. The model is compared with the risk assessment model based on the fuzzy TOPSIS method.

However, there are few studies in the literature related to gunshot injuries of the hip joint. The aim of the current study was to present the results of 10 cases treated with arthroplasty following a gunshot injury to the hip joint together with the recommended treatment algorithm. Methods: Patients with a previous medical history of hip joint region gunshot injury who underwent total hip arthroplasty were retrospectively evaluated. Those with incomplete medical records or who were lost to follow-up were excluded. Patients were classified according to the severity of the previous gunshot injury to the hip joint region. Harris hip score (HHS) and Short Form-12 quality of life score were the main outcome measurements. Postoperative complications encountered during follow-up were recorded. Results: The mean age of the patients at the time of surgery was 29.9 years. The mean preoperative HHS was 25.2 points and it was 65.8 at the final follow-up. Patients with bullet fragments in the hip joint, classified as group 1, had better HHS, whereas those with contaminated hip joint with intestinal flora, classified as group 3, had worst HHS.

      " Abstract: Notational analysis investigations of several sports have suggested that the performance characteristics associated with success differ by match closeness. It is not known whether this is the case in tennis. Therefore, this study aimed to first develop operational definitions for closely contested and one-sided tennis matches, then establish whether the important performance characteristics in elite grass court tennis differ by match closeness. Data from 365 men and 374 women's Wimbledon single matches played between 2015 and 2017 were analyzed. Irrespective of match closeness, points won of 0–4 shot rally length, first serve points won and baseline points won were associated with winning matches, and forced errors and unforced errors were associated with losing matches, for both sexes. Spearman's rank-order correlations demonstrated excellent agreement between the importance of the performance characteristics in closely contested and one-sided men (rs = 0.89, p < 0.001) and women's matches (rs = 0.90, p < 0.001), respectively. Findings suggest that expected match closeness (of an upcoming match) should not necessarily influence decision-making around practice design and match-play strategy. Additionally, the operational definitions developed for closely contested and one-sided matches developed here could be used in future studies to investigate different competitive contexts. © 2024 The Authors.

      " Abstract: Fullerenes have been a main focus of scientific research since their discovery due to the interesting possible applications in various fields like organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In particular, the derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is currently one of the most popular choices due to its higher solubility in organic solvents compared to unsubstituted C60. One of the central issues in the field of OPVs is device stability, since modules undergo deterioration (losses in efficiency, open circuit voltage, and short circuit current) during operation. In the case of fullerenes, several possibilities have been proposed, including dimerization, oxidation, and impurity related deterioration. We have studied by means of density functional theory the possibility of oxygen adsorption on the C60 molecular moiety of PCBM. The aim is to provide guidelines for near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements which can probe the presence of atomic or molecular oxygen on the fullerene cage. By analysing several configurations of PCBM with one or more adsorbed oxygen atoms, we show that a joint core level XPS and O1s NEXAFS investigation could be effectively used not only to confirm oxygen adsorption but also to pinpoint the bonding configuration and the nature of the adsorbate. © 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: To define those patients with upper urinary tract calculi who are more likely to have an unsuccessful outcome from extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Methods: A critical prospective analysis of 121 patients, referred to two university centers after ESWL had been exhausted as a treatment modality for upper urinary tract calculi, was performed. Patients were subdivided into the following groups: failure to clear fragments, failure to fragment, difficulty in calculus localization, and failure due to inherent upper urinary tract obstruction. Other important variables include the type of extracorporeal lithotriptor used, number of treatment sittings before referral, calculus location, calculus composition, patient body habitus, and the imaging leading to and associated with extracorporeal therapy. Results: Large renal calculi (mean, 22.2 mm) and those within dependent or obstructed portions of the collecting system were frequently referred for endoscopic management after failed ESWL. Steinstrasse can be an extremely morbid complication from ESWL and in this series was associated with irreversible loss of renal function and ureteral stricture disease. Extracorporeal lithotripsy of infectious calculi can be associated with severe septic complication. Inadequate preoperative and intraoperative imaging and morbid obesity were also associated with failure. Second- and third-generation lithotriptors were represented in greater numbers than the Dornier HM-3 in this group of ESWL failures. Conclusions: ESWL remains the treatment of choice for moderately sized, uncomplicated renal calculi. Large calculi, those within obstructed or dependent portions of the collecting system, and those composed of calcium oxalate monohydrate, frequently fail ESWL.

      " Abstract: This study investigated the epidemiological and clinical peculiarities of BCL2 and BCL6 rearrangement in patients with high grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) from Taiwan, compared with data from Western countries. Two hundred and eighty-two DLBCL cases from Taipei Medical University-affiliated hospitals (n = 179) and Tri-Service General Hospital (n = 103) were enrolled for this study. From the 282, 47 (16.7%) had MYC translocation; 24 of these harbored concurrent BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocation (double-hit, DH or triple-hit, TH). Twelve DH-HGBL cases had simultaneous MYC and BCL6 translocations, 8 harbored MYC and BCL2 rearrangement, while the remaining 4 patients exhibited TH. Together, 66.7% of DH/TH-HGBL patients were BCL6 rearrangement positive. Among these BCL6-rearranged DH/TH-HGBL patients, only 6 (37.5%) overexpressed MYC and BCL6 proteins simultaneously, indicating that MYC-BCL6 co-overexpression may not be plausible surrogate biomarker for screening BCL6-rearranged DH-HGBL. By the end of year 5, all patients with TH-HGBL, BCL2 DH-HGBL and all but one BCL6 DH-HGBL cases had expired or were lost to follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer for the non-DH/THHGBL group compared with the DH/TH-HGBL group. While the patients with BCL2 DH-HGBL were lost to follow-up by day 800, their remaining TH-HGBL and BCL6 DH-HGBL peers exhibited very poor PFS, regardless of age strata. More so, patients with BCL6 rearrangement were 5.5-fold more likely associated with extranodal involvement compared with their BCL2-rearranged peers. Moreover, ~60.0% of the BCL6-rearranged DH-HGBL cases were non-GCB, suggesting that including screening for BCL6 rearrangement in patients with the non-GCB phenotype may aid medical decisionmaking and therapeutic strategy. Contrary to contemporary data from western countries, 2 in every 3 patients with DH/TH-HGBL in Taiwan harbor BCL6 rearrangement. Consistent with present findings, we recommend mandatory screening for BCL6 rearrangement in patients with aggressive HGBL in Taiwan. © 2021 by the authors.

      " Abstract: Land-use/land-cover change (LUCC) is an important factor affecting carbon storage. It is of great practical significance to quantify the relationship between LUCC and carbon storage for regional ecological protection and sustainable socio-economic development. In this study, we proposed an integrated framework based on multiobjective programming (MOP), the patch-level land-use simulation (PLUS) model, and the integrated valuation of ecosystem service and trade-offs (InVEST) model. First, we used the InVEST model to explore the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of carbon storage in Hangzhou from 2000 to 2020 using land-cover data. Second, we constructed four scenarios of natural development (ND), economic development (ED), ecological protection (EP), and balanced development (BD) using the Markov chain model and MOP, and then simulated the spatial distribution of land cover in 2030 with the PLUS model. Third, the InVEST model was used to predict carbon storage in 2030. Finally, we conducted a spatial correlation of Hangzhou’s carbon storage and delineated carbon storage zoning in Hangzhou. The results showed that: (1) The artificial surfaces grew significantly, while the cultivated land decreased significantly from 2000 to 2020. The overall trend was a decrease in carbon storage, and the changing areas of carbon storage were characterized by local aggregation and sporadic distribution. (2) The areas of artificial surfaces, water bodies, and shrubland will continue to increase up to 2030, while the areas of cultivated land and grassland will continue to decrease. The BD scenario can effectively achieve the multiple objectives of ecological protection and economic development. (3) The carbon storage will continue to decline up to 2030, and the EP scenario will have the highest carbon storage, which will effectively mitigate the carbon storage loss. (4) The spatial distribution of carbon storage in Hangzhou was inextricably linked to the land cover, which was characterized by a high–high concentration and a low–low concentration. The results of the study can provide decision support for the sustainable development of Hangzhou and other cities in the Yangtze River Delta region. © 2022 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

We present the case of a 12-year-old girl who sustained a cervical spinal injury with unilateral facet dislocation and discuss details and problems of diagnostic procedures and treatment in the light of the recent literature. The management and pitfalls of a unilateral facet dislocation in a child are summarized. After initial reposition, a multisegmental instability with neurology developed. Although distraction-flexion cervical spine injuries are common in adults and often occur with concomitant neurological sequelae, they also can occur in the pediatric population. In conclusion, an MRI seems advisable. A treatment of postoperative malalignment with reposition via a halo-fixator cannot be recommended.

The advances in similarity learning are essential for smaller datasets or datasets in which few class labels exist per class such as wildlife re-identification. Improving the performance of similarity learning models comes with developing new sampling techniques and designing loss functions better suited to training similarity in neural networks. However, the impact of these advances is tested on larger datasets, with limited attention given to smaller imbalanced datasets such as those found in unique wildlife re-identification. To this end, we test the advances in loss functions for similarity learning on several animal re-identification tasks. We add two new public datasets, Nyala and Lions, to the challenge of animal re-identification. Our results are state of the art on all public datasets tested except Pandas. The achieved Top-1 Recall is 94.8% on the Zebra dataset, 72.3% on the Nyala dataset, 79.7% on the Chimps dataset and, on the Tiger dataset, it is 88.9%. For the Lion dataset, we set a new benchmark at 94.8%. We find that the best performing loss function across all datasets is generally the triplet loss; however, there is only a marginal improvement compared to the performance achieved by Proxy-NCA models. We demonstrate that no single neural network architecture combined with a loss function is best suited for all datasets, although VGG-11 may be the most robust first choice. Our results highlight the need for broader experimentation and exploration of loss functions and neural network architecture for the more challenging task, over classical benchmarks, of wildlife re-identification. © 2021 by the authors.

      " Abstract: Imbalanced dataset learning is an important practical issue in machine learning, even in support vector machines (SVMs). In this study, a well known reference model for solving the problem proposed by Veropoulos et al., is first studied. From the aspect of loss function, the reference cost sensitive prototype is identified as a penalty-regularized model. Intuitively, the loss function can change not only the penalty but also the margin to recover the biased decision boundary. This study focuses mainly on the effect from the margin and then extends the model to a more general modification. As proposed in the prototype, the modification first adopts an inversed proportional regularized penalty to re-weight the imbalanced classes. In addition to the penalty regularization, the modification then employs a margin compensation to lead the margin to be lopsided, which enables the decision boundary drift. Two regularization factors, the penalty and margin, are hence suggested for achieving an unbiased classification. The margin compensation, associating with the penalty regularization, is here utilized to calibrate and refine the biased decision boundary to further reduce the bias. With the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AuROC) for examining the performance, the modification shows relative higher scores than the reference model, even though the optimal performance is achieved by the reference model. Some useful characteristics found empirically are also included, which may be convenient for the future applications. All the theoretical descriptions and experimental validations show the proposed model's potential to compete for highly unbiased accuracy in a complex imbalanced dataset. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

      " Abstract: Agricultural drought loss models provide services for the rapid risk assessment of agricultural disasters, and regional disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. This paper takes wheat as an example, and chooses counties dominated by rain-fed farmland in Henan Province as the study area. Counties dominated by rain-fed farmland are determined by setting a rain-fed threshold that is related to the proportion of the effective irrigation area to the cultivated land area. Modeling samples are screened by considering both drought occurrence time and wheat yield reductions. Under different thresholds (30%, 40%, 50% and 60%), we use the yield loss ratio as the dependent variable and 24 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index parameters as independent variables to build drought loss models using both a multivariate stepwise regression model and a random forest model. Yield loss ratio from 1990 to 2015 is calculated by decomposing historical wheat yield time series. 24 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index variables are 1–3 months’ time scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index during the growth period (from October to May of the following year) of winter wheat in Henan Province. The results show that the random forest-derived model outperforms the stepwise regression model in all tests. The accuracy of all the models increases with an increase of the proportion of the rain-fed threshold. When the rain-fed threshold is 60%, the R2 values of the random forest model and the multivariate stepwise regression equation are 0.720 and 0.523, respectively. The validation results show that the mean absolute error and the root mean square error of the multivariate stepwise regression are 1.38 times and 1.31 times larger than the mean absolute error and the root mean square error from the random forests model. Moreover, both models identify that standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices in October (sowing/planting stage) and February (overwintering stage) are important variables. However, the multivariate stepwise regression model fails to recognize the importance of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration indices during April–May (filling stage). © 2020\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: It is the position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that prevention and treatment of pediatric overweight and obesity require systems-level approaches that include the skills of registered dietitians, as well as consistent and integrated messages and environmental support across all sectors of society to achieve sustained dietary and physical-activity behavior change. This position paper provides guidance and recommendations for levels of intervention targeting overweight and obesity prevention and treatment from preschool age through adolescence. Methods included a review of the literature from 2009 to April 2012, including the Academy's 2009 evidence analysis school-based reviews. Multicomponent interventions show the greatest impact for primary prevention; thus, early childhood and school-based interventions should integrate behavioral and environmental approaches that focus on dietary intake and physical activity using a systems-level approach targeting the multilevel structure of the socioecological model as well as interactions and relationships between levels. Secondary prevention and tertiary prevention/treatment should emphasize sustained family-based, developmentally appropriate approaches that include nutrition education, dietary counseling, parenting skills, behavioral strategies, and physical-activity promotion. For obese youth with concomitant serious comorbidities, structured dietary approaches and pharmacologic agents should be considered, and weight-loss surgery can be considered for severely obese adolescents. Policy and environmental interventions are recommended as feasible and sustainable ways to support healthful lifestyles for children and families. The Academy supports commitment of resources for interventions, policies, and research that promote healthful eating and physical-activity behaviors to ensure that all youth have the opportunity to achieve and maintain a weight that is optimal for health. © 2013 Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Adaptive decision making requires that contingencies between decision options and their relative assets be assessed accurately and quickly. The present research addresses the challenging notion that contingencies may be more visible from small than from large samples of observations. An algorithmic account for such a seemingly paradoxical effect is offered within a satisficing-choice framework. Accordingly, a choice is only made when the sample contingency describing the relative evaluation of the 2 options exceeds a critical threshold. Small samples, because of the high dispersion of their sampling distribution, facilitate above-threshold contingencies. Across a broad range of parameters, the resulting small-sample advantage in terms of hits is stronger than their disadvantage in false alarms. Computer simulations and experiments support the model predictions. The relative advantage of small samples is most apparent when information loss is low, when the threshold is high relative to the ecological contingency, and when the sampling process is self-truncated.

      " Abstract: Young drivers (18–24 years) are over-represented in sleep-related crashes (comprising one in five fatal crashes in developed countries) primarily due to decreased sleep opportunity, lower tolerance for sleep loss, and ongoing maturation of brain areas associated with driving-related decision making. Impaired driving performance is the proximal reason for most car crashes. There is still a limited body of evidence examining the effects of sleep loss on young drivers’ performance, with discrepancies in the methodologies used, and in the definition of outcomes. This study aimed to identify the direction and magnitude of the effects of sleep loss on young drivers’ performance, and to appraise the quality of current evidence via a systematic review. Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses (PRISMA) approach, 16 eligible studies were selected for review, and their findings summarised. Next, critical elements of these studies were identified, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines augmented to rate those elements. Using those criteria, the quality of individual papers was calculated and the overall body of evidence for each driving outcome were assigned a quality ranking (from ‘very low’ to ‘high-quality’). Two metrics, the standard deviation of lateral position and number of line crossings, were commonly reported outcomes (although in an overall ‘low-quality’ body of evidence), with significant impairments after sleep loss identified in 50% of studies. While speed-related outcomes and crash events (also with very low-quality evidence) both increased under chronic sleep loss, discrepant findings were reported under conditions of acute total sleep deprivation. It is crucial to obtain more reliable data about the effects of sleep loss on young drivers’ performance by using higher quality experimental designs, adopting common protocols, and the use of consistent metrics and reporting of findings based on GRADE criteria and the PRISMA statement.       © 2017 Shekari Soleimanloo et al.

      " Abstract: Human studies have shown that multiple teeth loss was significantly associated with cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. However, the causal relationship between tooth loss and cognitive deficits has not been clarified. Rodents demonstrate human-like cognitive faculties. In this study by performing rat gambling task (RGT), we reported that prolonged tooth loss condition by extracting all left molars in the rats led to an increase in the proportion of poor decision-makers, and decrease in the proportion of good decision-makers compared with controls. No influence was detected on the general activity and motivation after tooth loss. Recent experiments have shown that decision-making performances in the RGT rely on the functional integrity of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The theta band brain oscillation has been acknowledged for extensive cognitive functions. Here, we performed multiple-electrode array recordings of local field potential (LFP) in anesthetized rats. The results exhibited an increase in accumulative power of the theta frequency of LFP in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and decrease of theta power in the ACC in tooth loss rats. Furthermore, cross-correlation analysis displayed that tooth loss suppressed the synchronization of theta frequency of LFP between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications between these two regions. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that tooth loss leads to higher-order cognitive deficits accompanied by the alteration of theta frequency of LFP in brain circuitries and disruption of neural network integrity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Internal governance mechanisms affect the time horizon of foreign direct investment decisions differently because of their different objectives and characteristics. In this study, we empirically tested the relationship between internal governance mechanisms and the time horizon of foreign direct investment. Internal governance mechanisms for monitoring exert pressure on the short-term performance on a manager, causing the manager to focus on short-term perspective investment. However, internal governance mechanisms for interest alignment motivate a manager to invest in the foreign market with a long-term perspective. Outside directors and foreign ownership threaten the job and compensation of a manager. Thus, a manager cannot do anything but pursue a visible and predictable performance. However, a stock option has a structure of limited loss and unlimited gain, and it can be exercised even after resignation. Therefore, a manager with a stock option is motivated to focus on risky and long-term investments. © Research India Publications.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Overapplication of nitrogen fertilizer and water in vegetable production is popular and serious in China and other developing countries, leading to severe environmental pollution. To date, most model-based decision support systems, which are believed to be powerful tools for improving fertilizer and water management in vegetable production, have been established by developed countries, and the weather, soil, hydrology, facility type and vegetable species of developing countries have been less considered. In this study, a water level component and a new vegetable species, pakchoi (Brassica campestris ssp. Chinese) were incorporated into EU-Rotate_N, a simulation model developed by the European Union for open field vegetable cultivation. The experiment was carried out in typical vegetable plastic tunnels in Jiangsu Province, China, an area with high groundwater level. The results indicated that the water level algorithm which differentiate the soil into saturated and unsaturated layers enhanced the model simulation accuracy of the soil nitrogen and water content in the 30 cm soil layer, indicating the significant influence of groundwater on the soil water and nutrient movement. The pakchoi experiment suggest that new vegetables could be added into the crop list of EU-Rotate_N by adjusting parameters with ‘trial and error’ methods after considering its biological characteristics. Furthermore, a novel module was added for recommendations of fertilization and irrigation on daily basis in accordance with reasonable upper and lower thresholds of soil water content and soil available nitrogen after a series of adjustment. Finally, a user-friendly application (APP) was developed based on the improved model. The evaluation experiments in 2021 and 2022 showed that APP could significantly improve nitrogen and water use efficiency without obvious yield loss in pakchoi production. We conclude that simulation models for vegetable fertilizer and water management established by developed countries could be modified by several operable steps to expand its application area. © 2023 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Male sexual behavior depends on gonadal androgens in species of all major vertebrate lineages, including reptiles. However, male sexual behavior includes distinct appetitive and consummatory phases, typically denoted as courtship and mounting, with potentially different hormonal control. Different proximate controls of courtship versus mounting could enable disconnected evolutionary losses and gains of various aspects of male sexual behavior. Male courtship display, which is activated by testosterone (T) in many species, is an ancestral trait in the lizard family Eublepharidae. However, Coleonyx elegans (Yucatan Banded Gecko) lost the courtship display, while retaining a highly simplified male sexual behavior that involves only mounting for copulation. We performed surgical manipulations (castration with and without T replacement in adult males; implantation of adult females with exogenous T) to investigate hormonal mechanisms involved in this evolutionary novelty. Our results indicate that the expression of simplified sexual behavior in C. elegans does not require elevated circulating levels of T, a finding that is previously unreported in lizards. In females, however, exogenous T induced male-like mounting. Thus, the mounting phase of sexual behavior is not activated by T in the traditional sense of this term but probably requires post-natal, maturational organization (if not periodic reorganization) by androgens. We conclude that the simplification of male sexual behavior and its independence from elevated levels of circulating androgens in C. elegans evolved via 1) evolutionary loss of the androgen-activated courtship display and 2) retention of the mounting phase, which has a longer \"functional memory\" for the effects of androgenic steroids. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

As a result, the need for more resilient supply chain (SC) to mitigate the vulnerabilities has become paramount. Supply chain resilience (SCR) has been discussed in the literature and resilience index has been developed, but developing and selecting a portfolio of supply chain resilience capabilities in order to mitigate the vulnerabilities have not been studied. In this research we develop a 0-1 multi-objective optimization model based on QFD methodology. Our multi-objective method is interactive and interacts with the decision makers to choose the most satisfactory efficient portfolio of supply chain resilience strategies. We apply our methodology to three large ready-made garment (RMG) companies of Bangladesh. Results show that lack of materials (high dependence on imported materials), disruptions in utility supply, increased competition (and hence competitive pressure), impact of economic recession, and reputation loss are the top most vulnerabilities of Bangladesh RMG industry.

      " Abstract: We consider a firm's sourcing problem from one reliable supplier and one unreliable supplier in two price-setting scenarios. In the committed pricing scenario, the firm makes the pricing decision before the supply uncertainty is resolved. In the responsive pricing scenario, the firm's pricing decision is made after the supply uncertainty is resolved. For the committed pricing scenario, we develop a condition on supply uncertainty that guarantees the unimodality of the firm's objective function. By comparing the firm's optimal diversification decisions in the two pricing scenarios, we examine the interplay of supply diversification strategy and responsive pricing strategy in mitigating supply uncertainty. While both strategies are effective in mitigating supply uncertainty, we show that they are not necessarily substitutes. The relationship between these two strategies depends on two adverse effects caused by supply uncertainty: the lost-revenue effect and the lost-goodwill effect. More specifically, when the lost-revenue effect dominates the lost-goodwill effect, these two strategies are complements; otherwise, they are substitutes. Furthermore, we examine the impact of market size, price sensitivity, supplier reliability, and failure rebate on the interplay between these two strategies, and discuss the implications of our results. Finally, we extend our analysis to the case of two unreliable suppliers and show that the insights regarding the interplay between diversification and pricing continue to hold. © 2016 Production and Operations Management Society\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: High priority of soil-transmitted helminths worldwide and in the Russian Federation is due to their vast distribution and the severe pathological features they induce in humans. Recently, it was observed that awareness of clinicians regarding this disease category was markedly decreased, although no significant decline of the disease occurrence has been recorded, whereas rate of imported cases of parasitic diseases including soil-transmitted helminths like strongyloidiasis mainly originating from subtropical or tropical countries rose in non-endemic regions. Lack of alertness on diseases like strongyloidiasis impedes timely diagnostics and treatment. Global prevalence of strongyloidiasis was estimated to range within 30-100 million people, however the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that it was underestimated as precise data in endemic countries remain unknown. The occurrence of these helminths has been recorded in regions of temperate-continental climate: Western Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, the Caucasus, Central Asia, as well as in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region. In the Russian Federation locally acquired infections are frequently recorded in the Krasnodar Territory and Rostov Region. Here, based on multi-year experience in management of patients with strongyloidiasis we present our data and brief review of publications and systematic literature related to the challenges of its clinical picture, diagnostics and treatment. Life cycle, basic biological parameters of free-living helminth in nature and distinctive features of autoinfection related to strongyloidiasis were reviewed. Special attention was paid to the risk of developing severe forms (hyperinfection and disseminated strongyloidiasis) especially in immunocompromised hosts: HIV infection, radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy, long-term corticosteroid use. Difficulties in diagnosing Strongyloides stercoralis infection are due to its polymorphic and non-specific clinical manifestations, as well as the lack of clinical knowledge and awareness about the disease. Clinical importance of parasitological methods for larvae detection was underlined. It was noted that the drug of choice in therapy of strongyloidiasis is ivermectin unapproved yet in Russia, whereas albendazole as an alternative drug exerts poorer efficacy, justifying a need to repeat treatment courses to establish full recovery from the disease. © 2020 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

A survey evaluating parents’ knowledge of genetics for SNHL with and without GC was administered to parents of children with SNHL who were offered genetic testing. The survey also inquired about satisfaction, and decision to pursue genetic testing. Statistical tests included Fisher–Freeman–Halton test and Mann–Whitney test. Forty-nine participants completed the survey and were seen by both otolaryngology and GC intern (ENT + GC) (n = 24) or by otolaryngology (ENT) only (n = 25). Participation groups were not randomized. There were no significant differences in demographics between groups. Participants in the ENT + GC group had higher average genetics knowledge score of 72% correct (range 22%–100%), compared to the ENT only group with 44% (range 22%–78%) (p <.001). Participants in the ENT + GC group were more likely to know the different test result possibilities (p =.002), the most common form and pathogenic variant associated with SNHL (p <.001), that only a subset of genes are evaluated (p =.004), and that genetic testing may not explain SNHL etiology (p =.013), in comparison with the ENT only group. There was no significant difference in parental satisfaction or ultimate decision to undergo testing between groups. Obtaining genetic testing plays an integral role in the diagnosis and management of SNHL in the pediatric population. Our results suggest that the addition of GC increases parent knowledge of genetics and SNHL.

      " Abstract: Introduction: Travel requires various skills such as concentration, interpretation of information, and the confidence to take decisions and interact with other people. Mental illness can affect these skills and so cause barriers to travel. These issues are explored in this paper using the results from a cross-sectional on-line survey. Methods: The survey focussed on domestic travel. The link to the survey was distributed by eighteen mental health or transport organizations and three individuals through social media, newsletters and websites. Weightings were applied to make the results more representative of the national population with mental health conditions. Results: 89% of the respondents had anxiety and 76% were depressed. The biggest cause of anxiety was interacting with fellow travellers, both in terms of how they behaved and how the respondents felt that others perceived them. The second main cause of anxiety was needing support when travelling, both feeling out of control and requiring help from other people. Having to feel in control reflected another cause of anxiety: having to take action in an unfamiliar environment, because the method of travel has failed or because of the need to find suitable toilet facilities. Wayfinding caused anxiety in terms of feelings of disorientation, being lost and having to find the way. The fifth area of anxiety revolved around interacting with staff such as bus drivers and buying tickets. A high proportion of respondents had fluctuations in their health condition from day to day that meant that sometimes they could not leave home. Many of them were unable to commit to buying rail tickets in advance. Conclusions: People with mental health conditions have difficulty travelling because of various barriers that they face. Changes such as clearer, comprehensive travel information, better-designed buses, trains and infrastructure and quieter, calmer, less crowded journeys would enable them to travel more. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: The choice of anesthesia technique remains debatable in patients undergoing surgical repair of hip fracture. This meta-analysis was performed to compare the effect of neuraxial (epidural/spinal) versus general anesthesia on perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. Methods: Medline, Cochrane Library, Science-Direct, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible studies focused on the comparison between neuraxial and general anesthesia in hip fracture patients between January 2000 and May 2019. Perioperative outcomes were extracted for systemic analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using a Bonferroni correction and the leave-one-out method. The evidence quality for each outcome was evaluated by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 1084 patients fulfilled our selection criteria. The outcomes for the meta-analysis showed that there were no significant differences in the 30-day mortality (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 0.56, 3.21; P = 0.51), length of stay (MD = - 0.65, 95% CI -0.32, 0.02; P = 0.06), and the prevalence of delirium (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.27, 4.00; P = 0.95), acute myocardial infarction (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.17, 4.65; P = 0.88), deep venous thrombosis (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.09, 2.72; P = 0.41), and pneumonia (OR = 1.04, 95% CI 0.23, 4.61; P = 0.96) for neuraxial anesthesia compared to general anesthesia, and there was a significant difference in blood loss between the two groups (MD = - 137.8, 95% CI -241.49, - 34.12; p = 0.009). However, after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, all the adjusted p-values were above the significant threshold of 0.05. The evidence quality for each outcome evaluated by the GRADE system was low. Conclusions: In summary, our present study demonstrated that there might be a difference in blood loss between patients receiving neuraxial and general anaesthesia, however, this analysis was not robust to adjustment for multiple testing and therefore at high risk for a type I error. Due to small sample size and enormous inconsistency in the choice of outcome measures, more high-quality studies with large sample size are needed to clarify this issue. © 2020 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: A solution to any problem is valuable only if the results of the solution are reliable. This axiomatic statement is trivial. However, despite the fact that this statement is undeniable, it is violated regularly in problems of operations research. This is due to the fact that the proposed evaluation criteria are not verified and possibility of using indirect methods of effectiveness evaluation of operations is not substantiated. The problem point of modeling was shown using the example of comparison of operational processes, based on equally effective operations with multiple duration. This point is related to the fact that it is necessary to take into account inter-operational losses while modeling the process, based on the use of shorter operations in relation to an alternative operational process. Ignoring these losses can lead to making a mistaken decision or to errors in verification of estimation indicators. In a number of cases the problem can be solved using specially conducted experimental studies. However, if there is a set of unveri- fied estimation expressions or in verification problems, a formal approach can be used. Under this approach, uncertainty, arising in the process of modeling, can be removed by using the capabilities of a verified indicator itself. The developed method for modeling allows us to determine the scope of constraints on parameters of modeled operations. The probability of an error in results of modeling in problems, related to decision making, is excluded on condition of taking into account this region. © I. Lutsenko, I. Oksanych, I. Shevchenko, N.

Irrigation return flows are assumed to recharge the groundwater aquifer. It is shown that there is specialization in production with upstream farmers using surface water and downstream farmers pumping from the aquifer. An empirical model suggest that the proportion of return flows has a significant effect on the level of investments in water distribution as well as in the field. For example, if return flows are relatively high, it may be optimal to allows for significant water losses from the canal and the fields.

      " Abstract: The study was carried out to estimate classical swine fever (CSF) outbreak-related outcomes, such as epidemic duration and number of infected, vaccinated, and depopulated premises, using defined most likely CSF outbreak scenarios. Risk metrics were established using empirical data to select the most likely CSF outbreak scenarios in Indiana. These scenarios were simulated using a stochastic between-premises disease spread model to estimate outbreak-related outcomes. A total of 19 single-site (i.e., with one index premises at the onset of an outbreak) and 15 multiple-site (i.e., with more than one index premises at the onset of an outbreak) outbreak scenarios of CSF were selected using the risk metrics. The number of index premises in the multiple-site outbreak scenarios ranged from 4 to 32. The multiple-site outbreak scenarios were further classified into clustered (N = 6) and non-clustered (N = 9) groups. The estimated median (5th, 95th percentiles) epidemic duration (days) was 224 (24, 343) in the single-site and was 190 (157, 251) and 210 (167, 302) in the clustered and non-clustered multiple-site outbreak scenarios, respectively. The median (5th, 95th percentiles) number of infected premises was 323 (0, 488) in the single-site outbreak scenarios and was 529 (395, 662) and 465 (295, 640) in the clustered and non-clustered multiple-site outbreak scenarios, respectively. Both the number and spatial distributions of the index premises affected the outcome estimates. The results also showed the importance of implementing vaccinations to accommodate depopulation in the CSF outbreak controls. The use of routinely collected surveillance data in the risk metrics and disease spread model allows end users to generate timely outbreak-related information based on the initial outbreak's characteristics. Swine producers can use this information to make an informed decision on the management of swine operations and continuity of business, so that potential losses could be minimized during a CSF outbreak.

      " Abstract: No one doubts the significant variation in the practice of transfusion medicine. Common examples are the variability in transfusion thresholds and the use of tranexamic acid for surgery with likely high blood loss despite evidence-based standards. There is a long history of applying different strategies to address this variation, including education, clinical guidelines, audit and feedback, but the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these initiatives remains unclear. Advances in computerised decision support systems and the application of novel electronic capabilities offer alternative approaches to improving transfusion practice. In England, the National Institute for Health and Care Research funded a Blood and Transplant Research Unit (BTRU) programme focussing on ‘A data-enabled programme of research to improve transfusion practices’. The overarching aim of the BTRU is to accelerate the development of data-driven methods to optimise the use of blood and transfusion alternatives, and to integrate them within routine practice to improve patient outcomes.

      " Abstract: Factors affecting emergence by prey that enter refuges when approached by predators have been studied intensively, but only two theoretical models predict how long prey should remain in a refuge before emerging. We argue that prey can make better decisions than allowed by one model; the other model describes cases in which predators wait for prey to emerge. We present optimality models that permit prey to select a time to emerge that maximizes fitness. When in a refuge, a prey cannot obtain benefits outside; emerging too soon can be catastrophic, but delaying emergence entails loss of fitness. If predators resume foraging quickly rather than engaging in strategic waiting games, current theory suggests that prey emerge when the costs of remaining in a refuge and of emerging are equal. However, prey often can do better by emerging at the time maximizing fitness rather than when benefits equal costs (i.e. when prey break even). Optimal emergence time depends on initial fitness, benefits lost by remaining in refuge, and the decay rate of predation risk. Benefits lost if a prey is killed are modelled separately from benefits that contribute to lifetime fitness, even if the prey is killed (individual reproduction, altruism). Fitness of prey emerging at the optimal emergence time may be greater than, equal to or less than initial fitness. Break-even and optimality models base predictions on the opposing effects of risk and loss of benefits. Thus, many empirically verified predictions are identical at the ordinal level although differing quantitatively. Optimality models provide novel testable predictions for the effects of initial fitness, benefits, and, for ectotherms, the rate of cooling in refuge. They predict earlier emergence for equal retainable benefits than for those lost upon death. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: This study aims to analyze the 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) characteristics of different causes of fever of unknown origin (FUO) and identify independent predictors to develop a suitable diagnostic model for distinguishing between these causes. A total of 524 patients with classical FUO who underwent standard diagnostic procedures and PET/CT were prospectively studied. The diagnostic performance of PET/CT imaging was analyzed, and relevant clinical parameters that could improve diagnostic efficacy were identified. The model was established using the data of 369 patients and the other 155 patients comprised the validation cohort for verifying the diagnostic performance of the model. Results: The metabolic characteristics of the “hottest” lesion, the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes varied for various causes. PET/CT combined with clinical parameters achieved better discrimination in the differential diagnosis of FUO. The etiological diagnostic models included the following factors: multisite metabolic characteristics, blood cell counts, inflammatory indicators (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, and lactate dehydrogenase), immunological indicators (interferon gamma release assay, antinuclear antibody, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody), specific signs (weight loss, rash, and splenomegaly), and age. In the testing cohort, the AUCs of the infection prediction model, the malignancy diagnostic model, and the noninfectious inflammatory disease prediction model were 0.89 (95% CI 0.86–0.92), 0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.97), and 0.95 (95% CI 0.93–0.97), respectively. The corresponding AUCs for the validation cohort were 0.88 (95% CI 0.82–0.93), 0.93 (95% CI 0.89–0.98), and 0.95 (95% CI 0.92–0.99), respectively. Conclusions: 18F-FDG PET/CT has a certain level of sensitivity and accuracy in diagnosing FUO, which can be further improved by combining it with clinical parameters. Diagnostic models based on PET/CT show excellent performance and can be used as reliable tools to discriminate the cause of FUO.

Environmental and socio-economic studies are compared for reservoir developments in Nova Scotia, Labrador, Ontario and Saskatchewan. These span a six-year period in which federal and provincial guidelines, as well as public environmental awareness have evolved considerably. These projects also allow a comparison of public and government expectations relevant to socio-economic studies and public participation in regions with great variation in lifestyle, resource values, and environmental awareness. The public and political concerns raised through these projects ranged from Native land claims and resource uses, through recreational property values, to effects on semi-wilderness parkland and loss of prairie farmland. Political ramifications included dealing with diverse ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds. Innovative public participation approaches were required to convey technological understanding of the engineering and environmental study programs as well as to solicit accurate expressions of concerns over the developments. The increasing importance of public involvement in the decision process is emphasized.

The forces that arise during milling cause undesirable results, such as tool wear and energy loss. In this study, cutting parameters were optimized during the milling of AISI 321 material. Cutting speed (60, 70, 80 m/min), feed per tooth (0.04, 0.05, 0.06 mm/tooth), and depth of cut (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 mm) were selected as input parameters. Cutting force in the X and Y axes and the surface roughness were selected as the output parameters. Optimum parameters (60.80 m/min for cutting speed, 0.04 mm/tooth for feed per tooth, and 0.25 mm for depth of cut) were found using response surface methodology. The effect of cutting parameters was calculated by analysis of variance. The most influential parameters were found, depth of cut as 87.49% for cutting force on the X-axis, 86.48% on the Y-axis, and for surface roughness, the cutting speed with 36.48%. Prediction models are compared to choose the best model.

      " Abstract: Objective: This study examined the clinical significance of loss of control (LOC) over eating in bariatric surgery patients over 24 months of prospective, multiwave follow-ups. Method: Three hundred sixty-one gastric bypass surgery patients completed a battery of assessments before surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. In addition to weight loss and LOC over eating, the assessments targeted eating disorder psychopathology, depression levels, and quality of life. The study was conducted between January 2002 and February 2008. Results: Prior to surgery, 61% of patients reported general LOC; postsurgery, 31% reported LOC at 6-month follow-up, 36% reported LOC at 12-month follow-up, and 39% reported LOC at 24-month follow-up. Preoperative LOC did not predict postoperative outcomes. In contrast, mixed models analyses revealed that postsurgery LOC was predictive of weight loss outcomes: patients with LOC postsurgery lost significantly less weight at 12-month (34.6% vs 37.2% BMI loss) and 24-month (35.8% vs 39.1% BMI loss) postsurgery follow-ups. Postsurgery LOC also significantly predicted eating disorder psychopathology, depression, and quality of life at 12- and 24-month postsurgery follow-ups. Conclusions: Preoperative LOC does not appear to be a negative prognostic indicator for postsurgical outcomes. Postoperative LOC, however, significantly predicts poorer postsurgical weight loss and psychosocial outcomes at 12 and 24 months following surgery.

      " Abstract: To ensure accurate and effective emergency responses following an earthquake, one must promptly and accurately assess damage to structures with minimal manual effort. An advanced approach for evaluating structural damage is to use machine learning techniques for automated tagging or damage classification. However, most previous studies evaluated models using simple and unrealistic datasets limited to in-distribution (ID) datasets for training and testing. Although this approach may yield satisfactory results within the confines of the training dataset, it is not justifiable for real-time scenarios, in which the testing dataset may differ. Hence, a novel methodology is proposed herein that focuses on the detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) data. By subjecting a network to outliers, the model can effectively identify data outside the domain of the training dataset. A custom loss function is adopted, where both the cross-entropy loss from the ID training dataset and the log loss from the outlier dataset are incorporated. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through its application in the post-event rapid damage assessment of bridges and shear walls subjected to seismic loading. A single network is employed to classify ID data into their respective classes, whereas the OOD data are shown to belong to the OOD class. The results highlight the significant accuracy achieved in the simultaneous prediction of ID and OOD data. By incorporating the detection of OOD data, this study enriches the methods for improving the reliability and accuracy of structural damage assessments in earthquake emergency responses, thus enabling more informed decision-making. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The nuclear community frequently refers to the concept of “future generations” when discussing the management of high-level radioactive waste. However, this notion is generally not defined. In this context, we have to assume a wide definition of the concept of future generations, conceived as people who will live after the contemporary people are dead. This definition embraces thus each generation following ours, without any restriction in time. The aim of this paper is to show that, in the debate about nuclear waste, this broad notion should be further specified and to clarify the related implications for nuclear waste management policies. Therefore, we provide an ethical analysis of different management strategies for high-level waste in the light of two principles, protection of future generations—based on safety and security—and respect for their choice. This analysis shows that high-level waste management options have different ethical impacts across future generations, depending on whether the memory of the waste and its location is lost, or not. We suggest taking this distinction into account by introducing the notions of “close future generations” and “remote future generations”, which has important implications on nuclear waste management policies insofar as it stresses that a retrievable disposal has fewer benefits than usually assumed. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\u001b[0m :\n",

At the same time, they also need to implement forest health strategies which contribute to their environmental management systems and certification process. For example, the Australian Forestry Standard requires forest managers to identify, assess and prioritise any potential damage agents that may impact on forest ecosystem health and vitality. These health programs, however, are often run parallel with, and independently of, resource inventory programs. While most large growers maintain a health surveillance program, their capacity to quantify the impact of damaging agents on stand productivity and wood volume is often limited. Quantification of productivity losses due to biotic and abiotic agents would significantly improve decisions associated with resource scheduling and allocation of resources for pest control and stand amelioration. This paper discusses how remote sensing technologies can provide spatially-explicit data that permit the integration of plantation inventory and health assessments. The emerging diversity of sensor capabilities on both satellite and airborne platforms enables the development of hierarchical monitoring programs that can be customised for individual regions. For example, the coarse-scale sensor MODIS can provide very cheap coverage suitable for frequent temporal condition monitoring (thus identifying areas requiring more detailed attention in a timely manner), whereas the new generation of high-resolution sensors are facilitating a shift from manually mapped stand polygons (e.g. those from aerial sketchmapping and aerial photographic interpretation — API) to pixel and object-based digital analysis techniques suitable for both crown and stand-level inventory and canopy health assessment on a continuous, broad-scale basis. The application of these new technologies and associated spatial analyses permits the integration of plantation inventory and health assessment, thus providing forest managers with a holistic and cost-effective approach to timber production. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Malnutrition is common in hospitalized older people, and some have advocated routine nutritional screening. Serum albumin and clinically based measures such as the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) are two potential methods of assessing nutritional status in hospitalized older people. Although both measures are strongly associated with prognosis, it is not clear whether they measure similar or different clinical constructs. Our goal was to assess the degree of clinical concordance between these measures. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The inpatient medical service of a university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eleven older (aged ≥70) patients. MEASUREMENTS: We independently measured serum albumin and performed the SGA on 311 older medical patients (aged ≥70) shortly after hospital admission. The SGA classified patients as well nourished, moderately malnourished (generally 5% weight loss with mild examination findings), or severely malnourished (generally > 10% weight loss with marked findings) based on findings from a directed history and examination. We compared the distribution of clinical rating in patients with differing albumin levels and examined diagnostic test characteristics of albumin as a predictor of malnutrition as diagnosed on clinical examination. RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 79.9; 64% were women, 42% were African American. Discordance between albumin and the SGA was common. For example, 38% of patients with albumin levels of 4.0 g/dL or higher were at least moderately malnourished on the SGA, whereas 28% of patients with albumin levels lower than 3.0 g/dL were rated as well nourished. No choice of albumin level was associated with simultaneously acceptable sensitivity and specificity as a predictor of SGA ratings. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for albumin level as a predictor of SGA rating was 0.58, suggesting that the ability of either measure to predict the other measure is only marginally better than chance. CONCLUSIONS: Albumin levels and clinical assessments, two possible measures of nutritional status in hospitalized older people, are often discordant. To some extent, this reflects limitations in both measures as markers of nutritional status. However, it also demonstrates that, in this population, albumin and clinical assessments of nutritional status reflect fundamentally different clinical processes.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The diets of dogwhelks, Nucella lapillus, feeding naturally on the shore, were monitored continually. The sizes of prey eaten were compared with those available and foraging behaviour was related to prevailing weather conditions. Foraging behaviour varied widely among individuals, even within localized areas. Growth was correlated with cumulative energy intake and individuals that rarely fed lost weight. Foraging behaviour was constrained by weather conditions associated with heavy wave action in exposed places and desiccation in shelter. Under favourable circumstances, dogwhelks avoided smaller prey, so behaving as energy maximizers. Unfavourable weather confined the dogwhelks to the vicinity of refuges, restricting the choice of prey or preventing foraging altogether. Dogwhelks, therefore, provide a natural example of constrained optimization in foraging behaviour. © 1991 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Current evidence suggests that there is a prodromal stage in Parkinson disease characterized by a variety of nonmotor symptoms. Methods and Results: A 69-year-old man presented to our sleep center with isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. During a 10-year follow-up period, longitudinal clinical and laboratory assessments indicated the development of hyposmia, depression, mild cognitive impairment, and constipation. Parkinsonism was absent, but dopamine transporter imaging showed subclinical substantia nigra damage. Postmortem examination demonstrated neuronal loss and Lewy body pathology in the peripheral autonomic nervous system (eg, cardiac and myenteric plexus), olfactory bulb, medulla, pons, substantia nigra pars compacta (estimated cell loss, 20%-30%), nucleus basalis of Meynert, and amygdala, sparing the neocortex. Conclusions: Our observations indicate that nonmotor symptoms plus widespread peripheral and central nervous system pathological changes occur before parkinsonism and dementia onset in diseases associated with Lewy pathology.

      " Abstract: Monitoring and understanding Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) is critical for sustainable development, as it can impact various environmental, social, and economic systems. For example, deforestation and land degradation can lead to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and greenhouse gas emissions, affecting the quality of soil, air, and water resources. The present research examined changes in (LU/LC) within the underdeveloped regions of Balochistan and Sindh provinces, which are situated in Pakistan. In order to monitor temporal variations of LU/LC, we employed Geographic Information System (GIS) technique, to conduct an analysis of satellite imagery obtained from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) during the time period spanning from 2013 to 2023. In order to obtain an accurate LU/LC classification, we used principal component analysis (PCA) and a supervised classification approach using the maximum likelihood algorithm (MLC). According to the results of our study, there was a decrease in the extent of water bodies (− 593.24 km2) and vegetation (− 68.50 km2) by − 3.43% and − 0.40% respectively. In contrast, the area occupied by settlements in the investigated region had a 2.23% rise, reaching a total of 385.66 square kilometers. Similarly, the extent of barren land also expanded by 1.60%, encompassing a total area of 276.04 square kilometers, during the course of the last decade. The overall accuracy (94.25% and 95.75%) and K value (91.75% and 93.50%) were achieved during the year 2013 and 2023 respectively. The enhancement of agricultural output in Pakistan is of utmost importance in order to improve the income of farmers, mitigate food scarcity, stimulate economic growth, and facilitate the expansion of exports. To enhance agricultural productivity, it is recommended that the government undertake targeted initiatives that aimed at enhancing water infrastructure and optimizing land use to foster a sustainable ecological framework. Integrating the sustainable ecological framework provides a foundation for informed decision-making and effective resource management. By identifying areas of urban expansion, agricultural intensification, or alterations in natural LU/LC, stakeholders can design targeted conservation strategies, mitigating potential environmental degradation and promoting biodiversity conservation. In conclusion, the integration of GIS and Remote Sensing (RS) may effectively facilitate the monitoring of land use patterns over a period of time. This combined approach offers valuable insights and recommendations for the judicious and optimal management of land resources, as well as informing policy decisions. © The Author(s) 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: As agriculture has an increasing impact on the environment, new techniques can help meet future food needs while maintaining or reducing the environmental footprint. Those techniques must incorporate a range of sensing, communication, and data analysis technologies to make informed management decisions, such as those related to the use of water, fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, fuel, labor, etc., to help increase crop production and reduce water and nutrient losses, as well as negative environmental impacts. In this study, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model was trained on real data from Internet of Things sensors in a vineyard located in the Douro wine-growing region, from 2018–2021, to evaluate the ability of this model to predict the Fraction of Transpirable Soil Water (FTSW). The model uses historical data, including reference evapotranspiration, relative humidity, vapor pressure deficit, and rainfall, and outputs the FTSW for periods of one, three, five, and seven days. The model achieved an RMSE between 8.3% and 16.6% and an (Formula presented.) -score between 0.75 and 0.93. The model was validated on an independent dataset collected in 2002–2004 from a different vineyard located in the Lisbon wine-growing region, Portugal, and achieved an (Formula presented.) -score of 87% and an RMSE of 10.36%. Finally, the performance of the FTSW in the vineyard prediction model was compared with that of the Random Forest model, support vector regression, and linear regression. The results showed that BiLSTM performed better than the RF model on the unseen data, and the BiLSTM model can be considered a suitable model for the accurate prediction of the FTSW. © 2023 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The well-established Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) concept has been applied to several durable goods industries, including machinery. However, none of the existing TCO models explicitly focus on such highly energy-intensive equipment as metal melting furnaces. In this paper, an application of the TCO concept to aluminium melting furnaces is explored. A TCO model is created and tested through seven case studies in the aluminium die casting industry. Results indicate that the capital expenditure (CAPEX) incurred by the sample companies accounts for only 3-5% of a furnace TCO. Moreover, the melting technology implemented in the furnace highly impacts its TCO, as both the furnace's thermal efficiency and melting loss (i.e., the fraction of aluminium burnt during the melting process) significantly affect the costs incurred. Moreover, the sample furnaces' cost effectiveness clearly relies on scale. This evaluation leads to identify technological and managerial levers to reduce a furnace TCO, e.g., by adopting energy-efficient furnaces and by installing centralized, large-sized furnaces to pursue scale economies. © 2018 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) is a predictable consequence of head and neck cancer and its treatment. Loss of the ability to eat and drink normally has a devastating impact on quality of life for survivors of this type of cancer. Most rehabilitation programmes involve behavioural interventions that include swallowing exercises to help improve swallowing function. Such interventions are complex; consisting of multiple components that may influence outcomes. These interventions usually require patient adherence to recommended behaviour change advice. To date, reviews of this literature have explored whether variation in effectiveness can be attributed to the type of swallowing exercise, the use of devices to facilitate use of swallowing muscles, and the timing (before, during or after cancer treatment). This systematic review will use a behavioural science lens to examine the content of previous interventions in this field. It aims to identify (a) which behaviour change components are present, and (b) the frequency with which they occur in interventions deemed to be effective and non-effective. Methods/design: Clinical trials of behavioural interventions to improve swallowing outcomes in patients with head and neck cancers will be identified via a systematic and comprehensive search of relevant electronic health databases, trial registers, systematic review databases and Web of Science. To ascertain behaviour change intervention components, we will code the content for its theory basis, intervention functions and specific behaviour change techniques, using validated tools: the Theory Coding Scheme, Behaviour Change Wheel and Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy v1. Study quality will be assessed for descriptive purposes only. Given the specialisation and focus of this review, a small yield of studies with heterogeneous outcome measures is anticipated. Therefore, narrative synthesis is considered more appropriate than meta-analysis. We will also compare the frequency of behavioural components in effective versus non-effective interventions, where effectiveness is indicated by statistically significant changes in swallowing outcomes. Discussion: This review will provide a synthesis of the behaviour change components in studies that currently represent best evidence for behavioural swallowing interventions for head and neck cancer patients. Results will provide some guidance on the choice of optimal behavioural strategies for the development of future interventions.

      " Abstract: Purpose We present anesthetic management using a continuous spinal anesthesia (CSA) technique in a patient with placenta increta who underwent elective Cesarean hysterectomy with massive postpartum hemorrhage. Clinical features A 34-yr-old parturient (G3P2) was scheduled for Cesarean delivery and possible hysterectomy at 35 +3 weeks due to suspected placenta accreta. Her body mass index was 21 kg m -2 and she had a reassuring airway. Inadvertent dural puncture occurred during combined spinal-epidural (CSE) placement, and a decision was made to thread the epidural catheter and utilize a CSA technique. Following delivery of a healthy infant, morbid adherence of the placenta to the myometrium was confirmed, and at supracervical hysterectomy was performed. Eight litres of blood loss occurred postpartum requiring resuscitation with crystalloid 3,800 mL, colloid 1,500 mL, red blood cells 16 units, fresh frozen plasma 16 units, platelets 4 units, and cryoprecipitate 1 unit. The patient developed pulmonary edema requiring conversion to general anesthesia. The patient's cardiovascular status was stable throughout surgery, and her lungs were mechanically ventilated for 18 hr postoperatively in the intensive care unit. The intrathecal catheter was removed 24 hr after placement. She developed no adverse neurological sequelae and reported no postdural puncture headache. The pathology report confirmed placenta increta. Conclusion A CSA technique may be a viable option in the event of inadvertent dural puncture during planned CSE or epidural placement in patients with a reassuring airway undergoing Cesarean delivery. Although a catheterbased neuraxial technique is appropriate for Cesarean hysterectomy for abnormal placentation, conversion to general anesthesia may be required in the event of massive perioperative hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation. © 2012 Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

Such a new material was used as a solid support for palladium immobilization. For metal anchoring, encapsulation was the method of choice and palladium was encapsulated by in-situ polymerization. This resulting Pd@DHMF-based catalyst was characterized by solid-state 13C NMR, FT-IR, SEM, TGA, DSC, XRD, and XPS. To demonstrate proof of concept, Heck and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions were selected to evaluate the activity and reusability of the catalyst. Green solvents such as γ-valerolactone (GVL), CyreneTM and ethylene carbonate proved to be excellent reaction media for Heck coupling, whereas EtOH/H2O was preferred for Suzuki coupling.

      " Abstract: Background: Mobility loss is common in hospitalized older adults, and resources to prevent mobility impairment are finite. Our goal was to use routinely collected data to develop a risk assessment tool that identifies individuals at risk of losing the ability to walk during hospitalization on the first hospital day. Second, we determined if the tool could inform the use of mobility-preserving interventions. Methods: We included patients admitted to a general medical service, aged ≥65 years, who walked occasionally or frequently on admission (Braden Scale Activity subset > = 3). Patients were considered to have a new mobility impairment if, at discharge, their ability to walk was severely limited or nonexistent or they were confined to bed (Braden Scale Activity subset <3). We used predictors available on the first hospital day to develop (2017–18 cohort) and validate (2019 cohort) a risk assessment tool. We determined the association between predicted risk and therapy use in the validation cohort to highlight the model's clinical utility. Results: 5542 patients were included (median age 76 years, 48% women); 7.6% were discharged unable to walk. The model included 5 predictors: age, medication administrations, Glasgow Coma Scale verbal score, serum albumin, and urinary catheter presence. In the validation cohort, the model discriminated well (c-statistic 0.75) and was strongly associated with hospital-acquired mobility impairment (lowest decile 1%, highest decile 25%). In the validation cohort, therapy consultation ordering increased linearly with predicted risk; however, observed mobility impairment increased exponentially. Conclusion: The tool assesses the risk of mobility impairment in all ambulatory hospitalized older adults on the first hospital day.

      " Abstract: Background: Acute visual loss is a common chief complaint in emergency department (ED) patients, but the scarcity of ophthalmologists in most EDs limits its evaluation. Introduction: Our objective was to evaluate whether nonmydriatic fundus photography (NMFP) in the ED helps triage patients with acute visual loss. Materials and Methods: We included 213 patients with acute visual loss evaluated in the ED with NMFP as part of the Fundus Photography versus Ophthalmoscopy Trial Outcomes in the ED studies. Demographics, referral patterns, results of NMFP, and final diagnoses were recorded. Results: A final ophthalmological diagnosis was made in 109/213 (51%) patients. NMFP allowed a definite diagnosis in 51/109 (47%) patients: 14 nonglaucomatous optic neuropathies, 10 papilledema, 13 acute retinal ischemia, 2 retinal detachments, 2 choroidal metastases, 4 maculopathies, and 6 glaucoma. In 58/109 (53%) patients, NMFP was not diagnostic even when interpreted remotely by ophthalmologists due to disorders undiagnosable with NMFP. Ophthalmology consultation was requested in 109/213 (51%) patients, 41/54 (76%) patients with abnormal NMFP versus 68/159 (43%) patients with normal NMPF (p < 0.001). Discussion: Although NMFP allowed rapid diagnosis in 51/213 (24%) patients presenting to the ED with acute visual loss, NMFP alone was not sufficient to detect all ocular diseases; ophthalmology consultation was more often requested when NMFP was abnormal. Conclusions: Our study emphasizes the limitations of teleophthalmology with NMFP in remotely detecting ocular diseases related to acute visual loss in the ED.

      " Abstract: Introduction: Fencing is growing rapidly in popularity and competitiveness with fencers beginning at a younger age and competing in more tournaments. Even though fencing has a low risk of time-loss injury, fencers are inevitably going to experience injuries if proper athletic training and prevention does not occur. We aim to describe and compare the lower extremity injuries experienced by fencers that have trained at the highest level in the sport. We hypothesized that athletes who fenced longer would suffer more knee and hip injuries and report lower IKDC and HOS scores. Methods: This is an epidemiology study distributed to members of the U.S. national team and Olympic team from 1980 to 2018. The electronic survey included questions regarding age, weapon, number of years fencing, number of national and Olympic teams, injuries on the dominant and nondominant hip and knee, time missed due to injury, and methods for treatment. The survey also included the International Knee Demographic Committee (IKDC) and Hip Outcome Score (HOS). Results: There were 153 national team members between July 1980 and July 2018, 110 with contact information. A total of 77 athletes submitted the survey, consisting of 30 females and 47 males. Female fencers had more hip injuries and lower IKDC and HOS scores than their male counterparts. In total, there were 71 injuries to the dominant (front) knee and 28 injuries to the nondominant (back) knee. There were 32 dominant hip injuries and 5 nondominant hip injuries. Saber fencers reported the most dominant and nondominant hip and knee injuries. Conclusion: The intense, repetitive and asymmetrical movements involved in fencing affect the weight bearing leg and the nondominant leg in all weapons. Special attention should be paid to female fencers as they experience more hip and knee injuries resulting in impaired joint function. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Protected areas (PAs) are a commonly used strategy to confront forest conversion and biodiversity loss. Although determining drivers of forest loss is central to conservation success, understanding of them is limited by conventional modeling assumptions. We used random forest regression to evaluate potential drivers of deforestation in PAs in Mexico, while accounting for nonlinear relationships and higher order interactions underlying deforestation processes. Socioeconomic drivers (e.g., road density, human population density) and underlying biophysical conditions (e.g., precipitation, distance to water, elevation, slope) were stronger predictors of forest loss than PA characteristics, such as age, type, and management effectiveness. Within PA characteristics, variables reflecting collaborative and equitable management and PA size were the strongest predictors of forest loss, albeit with less explanatory power than socioeconomic and biophysical variables. In contrast to previously used methods, which typically have been based on the assumption of linear relationships, we found that the associations between most predictors and forest loss are nonlinear. Our results can inform decisions on the allocation of PA resources by strengthening management in PAs with the highest risk of deforestation and help preemptively protect key biodiversity areas that may be vulnerable to deforestation in the future. © 2023 The Authors.

The experience with infrastructure PPPs internationally have demonstrated many problems and partnership failures, where both the public and private sectors suffered huge losses. Motivated by a number of these failures, this study investigates the actions and decisions of private-sector partners by evaluating 35 failed transportation PPPs around the world. This paper identifies a set of drivers responsible for the failures of transportation PPPs, discusses the causal relationships between them, and finally evaluates a set of failure mechanisms initiated by the private-sector partners. It sheds light on the role of private-sector partners in terms of triggering failure mechanisms in transportation PPP failures. The identification of failure mechanisms discloses the fact that inappropriate decisions and actions of private-sector partners (i.e., failure drivers) have created problems for other project partners, which ultimately caused the PPP failures. The failure mechanism model suggested here provides insight into the existing failure trends associated with private-sector partners in transportation PPPs. These findings will help private-sector partners to safeguard partnerships more effectively and provide public-sector PPP practitioners with a better understanding of their partners' actions and decisions and their influence on project success. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The trade in international coal grew rapidly from a small base in the 1980's and has begun to impact on the domestic price of UK coal. The level of output of UK coal and the domestic price of coal is now linked to overseas developments in the industry. An analysis of the principal characteristics of established international minerals is useful in order to isolate factors which are important for the decision makers who will be involved in identifying future opportunities for UK coal. For many decades, the base metals and precious metals have been traded at prices which are determined by centralised markets in the major financial centres such as London, New York and Tokyo. More recently crude oil has joined these groups. Price volatility due to periodic swings from surplus to deficits in supply are a regular occurrence in the international minerals markets and this is becoming a feature of the coal market. Producers and consumers have tried several techniques to avoid adverse price movements and the latest method involves the use of forward transactions in the market. Sales and purchases are arranged to take place at a future date at prices which are agreed today. By this method an adverse price movement is avoided, but the benefit of an advantageous price movement in the future is lost. The operation of these markets requires the participation of traders who are prepared to take the risk away from the producers and consumers. The methods of reducing risk in the international minerals markets will have to be learnt by the UK coal industry as it becomes involved to a greater extent in the growing international coal market.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: To assess the feasibility of retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy combined with bench surgery and autotransplantation in treating complex renal tumor. Patients and Methods: Six patients with complex renal tumor were seen in our institution between 2010 and 2014. Three patients with bilateral renal cell carcinoma underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic nephrectomy on both sides. Extracorporeal tumorectomy and renal reconstruction were performed on the side of the smaller tumor and then kidney autotransplantation was performed. The other 3 patients with tumor involving the solitary kidney underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy combined with bench surgery and autotransplantation. Result: The total time of the operation was 287 ± 25 min; warm ischemia time 3.1 ± 0.7 min; cold ischemia time 47 ± 8.1 min; and kidney autotransplantation required time 86 ± 8.6 min. Estimated blood loss was 232 ± 45.8 ml. Serum creatinine levels were 179 ± 44.7 μmol/l upon hospital discharge. Two patients received temporary hemodialysis. No patient needed further hemodialysis during follow-up. One patient died of multiple metastases 18 months after surgery. The other 5 patients survived without recurrence or metastasis during follow-up. Conclusions: Retroperitoneal laparoscopic radical nephrectomy combined with bench surgery and autotransplantation is a feasible choice for patients with complex renal cell carcinoma in bilateral kidneys and tumor involving the solitary kidney. © 2016 S.

      " Abstract: As flood risk is projected to increase, effective flood risk management (FRM) is crucial not only for mitigating direct flood damage but also for contributing to the long-term improvement of livelihoods and hence the socioeconomic development of flood-prone areas in developing countries. While many studies have assessed avoided damage as the benefit of flood countermeasures, few recognize the impact on improvements in livelihood resulting from risk reduction. We present a novel framework that captures the dynamic relationship between decreasing flood risk perception and improvements in household livelihoods. Using the case of flood-prone Bago, Myanmar, we apply this framework to evaluate 127 flood management strategies under different assumptions of future climate change and socioeconomic features. We show that the benefits of improved livelihoods, when quantified alongside avoided flood losses, have a significant impact enough to change the cost-efficiency rankings of flood management strategies. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating livelihood improvements into FRM decision making to promote the sustainable development in flood-prone areas. © 2024 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background and Purpose: Kidney transplantation (KT) is the best therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Major urologic complications (MUCs) are the second etiology associated to morbidity and graft loss following KT, after rejection episodes. The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence, risk factors and impact on graft survival associated to urological complications in KT patients. Patients and Methods: A retrospective cohort based on electronic patient files of kidney transplant recipients from Colombiana de Trasplantes was created for the period August 2008 to September 2019. Initiation of follow-up was defined as the date of transplantation up to 3 years post-transplantation. Incidence of ureteral stenosis, ureteral obstruction, and ureteral leak was measured. A logistic regression multivariate model was adjusted to determine the associated factors to MUCs (yes/no). Patient and graft survival time were analyzed using a Kaplan-Meier method. Results: A total of 1584 KT patients were included in the cohort. MUCs were present in 195 (12.6%) KT patients. We found that dialysis duration (OR: 1.004; p = 0.02) remained significant for the incidence of MUCs in KT patients of deceased donors. Probability of graft and patient survival at 3 years of follow-up was 90.5% and 85.5%, respectively. No significant difference was found on graft and patient survival in KT patients with or without MUCs. Conclusion: MUCs are frequent complications for KT. We did not observe significant differences in graft or patient survival according to the presence of MUCs. The identification of MUCs and risk factors may guide transplant teams for future surgical and clinical decisions. © 2022 Nino-Torres et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare advantages, disadvantages, and outcomes in patients who undergo vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy for enlarged symptomatic uteri. STUDY DESIGN: In a prospective, randomized study, 60 vaginal hysterectomies (study group) were compared with 59 abdominal hysterectomies (control group); all of the hysterectomies were performed for symptomatic uterine fibroids from January 1997 through December 2000. We excluded from the study the other common causes of hysterectomy such as prolapse, bleeding, adenomyosis, and endometrial or cervical carcinoma. In both groups, uterine weights ranged from 200 g to 1300 g. For enlarged uteri, vaginal hysterectomies were performed with the use of volume reduction techniques: intramyometrial coring, corporal bisection, and morcellation. The evaluated parameters included patient age, weight, parity, uterine weight, operative time, blood loss, demand for analgesics, eventual surgical complications, length of admission, and hospital charges. The Mann-Whitney U test and X2 tests were applied for statistical analysis. Probability values of <.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: There were no major differences in patient age, weight, parity, and uterine weight between the two groups. Operative time was significantly lower for the vaginal route as compared with the abdominal route (86 minutes vs 102 minutes, P < .001). No intraoperative complications were noted both in the study and control groups or the control group. Surgical bleeding (expressed by hemoglobin loss) was not significantly different between the two groups. In the postoperative period, we found a higher incidence of fever (30.5% vs 16.6%, P < .05) and demand for analgesics (86% vs 66%, P < .05) in the abdominal group as compared with the vaginal group. Significant advantages of vaginal hysterectomy were a reduction in the hospital stay (3 days vs 4 days, P < .001) and cost. CONCLUSION: These results should lead to the choice of vaginal hysterectomy as a valid alternative to the abdominal hysterectomy, even for enlarged uteri.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose.To explore how patients with persistent unexplained pain interpret and utilise the biopsychosocial model. This might have an impact on the outcome from treatment programmes that adopts a biopsychosocial approach. Method.We conducted three interviews with 20 patients attending a pain management programme for persistent unexplained back pain; prior to attending the course, immediately following the course and at 1 year. We used the methods of grounded theory. Results.Patients battled through several dialectic tensions in an attempt to legitimise their pain: First, patients wanted a medical diagnosis but also recognised that psychosocial factors contributed to their pain. Second, although the outward appearance of pain was important to legitimacy, it was also important not to appear 'too ill'. Third, meeting others with unexplained pain reinforced credibility, but patients also described how they were not 'like the others'. Finally, although holding on to one's self was important, patients also described an acceptance of loss. Conclusions.These dialectic tensions are likely to have an impact on a person's decision to embrace the biopsychosocial model, and might therefore effect their outcome.

      " Abstract: Natural and anthropic disasters produce relevant economic and environmental losses at a global level. Many countries have adopted a risk management cycle to limit these losses. Agenda 2030 defined specific Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and relative targets dedicated to disaster risk reduction. Planned actions can pertain to the context “before” or “after” a disastrous event. The United Nations recommend a risk-informed approach for achieving the SDGs by working on anticipation and prevention. Planning with training and exercises, referring to transport systems in emergency conditions, can limit disaster impacts and strongly support the pursuit of sustainability. This research focuses on actions and methodologies for increasing preparedness levels “before” a disastrous event, to improve the capabilities of managers and people by increasing awareness of the effects of planned actions. Transport system models (TSMs) play an important role in simulating the evacuation of people to reduce theoretical risk, thereby reducing theoretical exposure. In this work, a method is presented that allows us to investigate how this theoretical reduction can become effective, through training and exercises. The paper proposes a general framework of training and exercises for risk reduction based on a given transportation planning model. The framework supports ex ante evaluations of exposure reduction produced by an evacuation plan. The obtained results show that the effectiveness of the planned actions increases with different levels of exercise implementation. The progressive implementation of exercises contributes to achieving the risk reductions estimated at the evacuation planning stage. The TSM in the mitigation phase is the basis for the development of specific quantitative evacuation plans, that must be implemented in the preparedness phase by means of training and exercises to test the planned actions in terms of reducing the exposure risk component. Some exercises implemented worldwide verify the proposed framework by means of some empirical evidence. The results and discussions reported in this paper can be useful for researchers, decisionmakers, and society by offering a contribution to the growing knowledge about risk and the potential actions and their relative effects on reducing it. © 2024 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The aim of the present study was to measure contrast sensitivity curves for angular frequencies in the range between 2 and 96 cycles/360° in older human adult volunteers and to compare these measurements with the more usual contrast sensitivity functions for sine-wave gratings. All subjects were free of identifiable ocular disease and had normal acuity. We measured the contrast thresholds for young adults (N = 6; age range, 20-26 years) and older adults (N = 6; age range, 60-67 years) using the psychophysical forced-choice method. In this paradigm the volunteers had to choose the stimulus containing a test frequency at low contrast (e.g., either a sine-wave grating or an angular frequency stimulus), or another neutral stimulus at mean luminance (without any contrast). Older adults presented a loss in contrast sensitivity at high and medium angular frequencies compared to the young adults (i.e., from 8 to 96 cycles/360°). Contrary to expectation, contrast sensitivity at low angular frequencies, i.e., 2 and 4 cycles/360°, was better for the older group than for the younger group. On the other hand, contrast sensitivity for sine-wave gratings at 3 and 4 cpd was higher for young adults as expected. These results suggest age-related changes in the contrast sensitivity function for angular frequencies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Unlike most other branches of industry the German cement industry is heavily dependent on local raw material deposits. However, the legal options for guaranteeing long-term raw material supplies have been neglected by the lawmakers. Whereas nature conservation has now been elevated to a national objective and European directives will ensure its future security, policy makers and administrators are increasingly losing sight of the necessity of guaranteeing long-term raw material supplies. Legal implementation of the guarantees of raw material supply in Germany is characterized by fragmentation of the relevant laws. There is no federal law on raw material supply and no efficient administrative planning procedure. At least the new Raumordnungsgesetz (law concerning regional planning) contains a principle according to which the conditions shall be created \"for precautionary measures to guarantee supply, orderly exploration and exploitation of geographically fixed raw materials deposits\". However, the implementation of this principle of \"guaranteeing supplies of raw materials\" is imposed on the federal states which in the past have accorded different levels of priority to this task, threatening to render it liable to regional or local planning, despite the need to cover greater areas. By contrast, nature conservation has gained political and legal weight, forcing the interests of raw material supplies on the defensive. The directive on Fauna and Flora Habitats recently adopted into German law has contributed greatly to this situation. A new federal act concerning long-term raw material supply and unifying the fragmented state law could make the necessary administrative planning easier. Regardless of this, companies operating in this area must fashion an active, forward-looking policy for guaranteeing raw material supplies. Decision makers in politics, administration and social institutions must be given a better understanding of the economic importance of the cement industry. The companies have to develop a planning strategy based on consensus. Exploitation of raw materials needs to be understood as a temporary use of natural resources which secures employment and opens up new long-term options for nature conservation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: A common denial trend that occurs with \"outpatient medical benefit drugs\"(ie, medications covered by a medical benefit plan and administered in an outpatient visit) is payers not requiring or permitting prior authorization (PA) proactively, yet denying the drug after administration for medical necessity. In this situation, a preemptive strategy of complying with payer-mandated requirements is critical for revenue protection. To address this need, our institution incorporated a medical necessity review into its existing closed-loop, pharmacy-managed precertification and denials management program. Summary: Referrals for targeted payers and high-cost medical benefit drugs not eligible for PA and deemed high risk for denial were incorporated into the review. Payer medical policies were evaluated and clinical documentation assessed to confirm alignment. This descriptive report outlines the medical necessity workflow as a component of the larger precertification process, details the decision-making process when performing the review, and delineates the roles and responsibilities for involved team members. A total of 526 drug orders were evaluated from September 2018 to August 2019, with 146 interventions completed. Of the 761 individual claims affected by proactive medical necessity review, 99.2% resulted in payment and less than 1% resulted in revenue loss, safeguarding more than 5.3 million in annual institutional drug reimbursement. At the time of analysis, there were only 3 cases of revenue loss. Conclusion: Our institution's pharmacy-managed medical necessity review program for high-cost outpatient drugs safeguards reimbursement for therapies not eligible for payer PA.

      " Abstract: Liquid Pb-16Li eutectic alloy is the tritium breeding material in several breeding blanket concepts for European DEMO reactor, which are the Helium-Cooled Lithium-Lead (HCLL), the Water-Cooled Lithium-Lead (WCLL) and the Dual-Coolant Lithium-Lead (DCLL). RAFM (Reduced-Activation Ferritic/Martensitic) steels are considered as structural materials for breeding blankets in fusion reactors and EUROFER steel (9Cr-1.1W-0.2 V) is the European current choice for DEMO. Moreover, the WCLL European Test Blanket Module (TBM) to be installed in ITER will be manufactured in EUROFER. Here, the chemical compatibility of EUROFER in Pb-16Li is a major issue due to the dissolution of the material at high temperature in the liquid metal. In this work the corrosion of EUROFER in static Pb-16Li melt was investigated at 550 °C up to 8000 h of exposure to approximate low-flow WCLL blanket conditions. SEM-EDX analysis were performed on corroded samples to assess morphology and compositional changes occurring during the exposure. The corrosion was numerically evaluated by weight loss on samples exposed to various exposure times (2000, 4000 and 8000 h) and the corrosion rate for one year of exposure (8760 h) was extrapolated. The analysis by SEM-EDX showed that EUROFER mostly dissolved uniformly with a depletion of Cr and an enrichment of W at the near interface. The analysis of the weight loss provided an extrapolation of the corrosion rate of 18 μm/yr at 550 °C. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: Despite Bangladesh's great strides in formulating disaster management policies following the principles of good governance, the degree to which these policies have successfully been implemented at the local level remains largely unknown. The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to examine the roles and effectiveness of local-level governance and disaster management institutions, and (2) to identify barriers to the implementation of national policies and Disaster-Risk-Reduction (DRR) guidelines at the local community level. Design/methodology/approach: Between January 2014 and June 2015 we carried out an empirical investigation in two coastal communities in Bangladesh. We employed a qualitative research and Case Study approach, using techniques from the Participatory Rural Appraisal toolbox to collect data from local community members as well as government and NGO officials. Findings: Our study revealed that interactive disaster governance, decentralization of disaster management, and compliance by local-level institutions with good governance principles and national policy guidelines can be extremely effective in reducing disaster-loss and damages. According to coastal community members, the local governments have generally failed to uphold good governance principles, and triangulated data confirm that the region at large suffers from rampant corruption, political favoritism, lack of transparency and accountability and minimal inclusion of local inhabitants in decision-making – all of which have severely impeded the successful implementation of national disaster-management policies. Research limitations/implications: While considerable research on good governance has been pursued, our understanding of good disaster governance and their criteria is still poor. In addition, although numerous national disaster management policy and good governance initiatives have been taken in Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, the nature and extent of their local level implementation are not well known. This study contributes to these research gaps, with identification of further research agenda in these areas. Practical implications: The study focuses on good disaster governance and management issues and practices, their strengths and limitations in the context of cyclone and storm surges along coastal Bangladesh. It offers specific good disaster governance criteria for improving multi-level successful implementation. The paper deals with International Sendai Framework that called for enhancement of local level community resilience to disasters. Thus, it contributes to numerous policy and practice areas relating to good disaster governance. Social implications: Good disaster governance would benefit not only from future disaster losses but also from improved prevention and mitigation of natural hazards impact, benefiting society at large. Improvement in knowledge and practice in disaster-risk-reduction through good governance and effective management would ensure local community development and human wellbeing at the national level. Originality/value: The failure of local-level government institutions to effectively implement national disaster management and resilience-building policies is largely attributable to a lack of financial and human resources, rampant corruption, a lack of accountability and transparency and the exclusion of local inhabitants from decision-making processes. Our study identified the specific manifestations of these failures in coastal communities in Bangladesh. These results underscore the vital need to address the wide gap between national DRR goals and the on-the-ground realities of policy implementation to successfully enhance the country's resilience to climate change-induced disasters. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

This model makes no assumptions about the curvature of utility and does not assume a built-in asymmetry in gains and losses. Nonetheless it is able to generate a type of loss aversion and can explain behavioral anomalies related to reference dependence. In addition, the model makes a number of novel predictions that differentiate it from existing accounts of reference dependence and can easily be extended to predict instances of choice set dependence and anchoring effects.

Data from 280 higher education students (63.2% females) aged between 18 and 27. years were analysed. Several eating behaviour dimensions (emotional and external eating, flexible and rigid restraint, binge eating, and eating self-efficacy) were assessed, and eating styles were derived through cluster analysis. BMI for current, desired and maximum self-reported weights and the differences between desired and current BMI and between maximum and current BMI were calculated. Women scored higher in emotional eating and restraint, whereas men showed higher eating self-efficacy. Men had higher current, desired and maximum BMI. Cluster analysis showed three eating styles in both male and female subsamples: \"Overeating\", \"High self-efficacy\" and \"High restraint\". High self-efficacy women showed lower BMI values than the others, and restrictive women had higher lost BMI. High self-efficacy men showed lower desired BMI than overeaters, and lower maximum and lost BMI than highly restrictive ones. Restrictive women and men differ on important eating behaviour features, which may be the cause of differences in the associations with BMI.

      " Abstract: The postoperative results in 392 otosclerotic ears were analyzed. Stapedotomy with wire Teflon piston does not increase the risk of postoperative fistula formation in comparison to stapedectomy with tissue graft sealing. Stapedotomy with a 0.4mm wire Teflon piston yields poorer results in the lower frequencies 3 weeks postoperatively but results as good as those of 0.6 mm stapedotomy at 3 months and 1 year follow-up. The advantage of 0.4mm stapedotomy is to permit creation of the desired fenestra into the footplate and placement of the prosthesis before violating the integrity of the incudostapedial joint and of the stapedial arch. Stapedotomy with the 0.4 mm wire Teflon piston is the operation of choice for otosclerosis, since it is less traumatic to the inner ear and achieves better results than stapedectomy. © 2009, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Treatment of solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura is surgical resection. Post-operative surveillance is recommended to identify early recurrent disease. Case presentation: We present a rare case of a 76-year-old female patient with no previous pulmonary history who presented with progressive dyspnea, fatigue, and involuntary weight loss. On chest X-ray and computed chest tomography scan, she was found to have a 16.7 cm × 12.8 cm × 10.1 cm bulky mass occupying the left hemithorax with associated compressive atelectasis of the lung. She underwent a computed tomography guided biopsy that revealed the mass to be a solitary fibrous tumor. The patient underwent left muscle sparing lateral thoracotomy with complete resection of the tumor. Post procedure, the left lung fully expanded. 18 months post-resection, she developed a 3.3 cm × 1.7 cm tumor along the left internal thoracic artery lymph node chain which was histologically identical to the resected tumor. The patient is currently being treated with bevacizumab and temozolomide. Conclusion: Solitary fibrous tumors are very rare pleural tumors.

      " Abstract: Hemiarthroplasty is a surgical choice for super-aged patients with a high surgical risk and a sedentary lifestyle. The direct superior approach (DSA), a minimally invasive modification of the posterior approach, is rarely studied in hemiarthroplasty. The aim of the present study was to compare the clinical outcomes in elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures undergoing hemiarthroplasty via DSA with the conventional posterolateral approach (PLA). A total of 48 elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures who underwent hemiarthroplasty between February 2020 and March 2021 were retrospectively included in the study. Of them, 24 patients (mean age 84.54 ± 2.11 years) were treated with hemiarthroplasty via DSA (DSA group), while the other 24 patients (mean age 84.92 ± 2.15 years) were treated with hemiarthroplasty via PLA (PLA group). Clinical outcomes, perioperative data, and complications were recorded. There were no obvious differences in the baseline characteristics between the DSA and PLA groups, including age, gender, body mass index, Garden type, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and hematocrit. Perioperative data showed that the length of the incision in the DSA group was smaller than that in the PLA group (p < 0.001). However, the duration of the operation and blood loss in the DSA group were longer and higher than those in the PLA group, respectively (p < 0.001). In addition, the DSA group had a shorter hospitalization time than the PLA group (p < 0.001). The visual analog scale score and Harris score 1 month postoperatively in the DSA group were better than those in the PLA group (p < 0.001). Moreover, there were no significant differences between the two groups in Harris score (for assessment dysfunction) 6 months postoperatively (p > 0.05). DSA is less invasive and has better clinical outcomes, which can allow an early return to daily living activities in elderly patients with displaced femoral neck fractures undergoing hemiarthroplasty. 2023 Hu, Xu, Li, Jiang, Shao, Shan, Yang, Wan and Shuang.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Rational choice theory in criminology is based on a model of decision-making, expected utility theory (EUT), that research in psychology and economics has shown to be descriptively inaccurate for many types of human decisions. Because of its ability to account for intuitive reasoning and anomalies in crime decisions, prospect theory (PT) may be a viable alternative to EUT for explaining criminal choices. The present study tests several hypotheses derived from PT about the effects of framing, reference dependence, and decision weights in crime decisions. We present findings from a series of survey-based experiments conducted with three different samples. The results support our hypotheses derived from EUT, but not those from PT. We find that although initial wealth, criminal benefits, and arrest risk impact offender decision-making, sanction-cost frames and gains/losses from monetary reference points have little if any effect.

This article builds a DOPF model with discrete and continuous variables, and then proposes the iterative method based on the master and sub-problems obtained from the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD). Firstly, the power output of conventional generators and the reactive power of the wind farm are modeled as the continuous decision variables, and the transformer taps ratio is built as a discrete decision variable. Secondly, the objective function is to minimize the total power generation cost and network loss. Thirdly, the DOPF problem is decomposed into the master problem and sub-problems by fixing a complex variable, which reduces the complexity of DOPF. Then, the proposed algorithm is used to solve the master and subproblems. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed method has advantages in terms of reducing computational time and enhancing accuracy. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

      " Abstract: The wear behavior of AZ91 alloy was investigated by considering different parameters, such as load (10−50 N), sliding speed (160−220 mm/s) and sliding distance (250−1000 m). It was found that wear volume loss increased as load increased for all sliding distances and some sliding speeds. For sliding speed of 220 mm/s and sliding distance of 1000 m, the wear volume losses under loads of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 N were calculated to be 15.0, 19.0, 24.3, 33.9 and 37.4 mm3 respectively. Worn surfaces show that abrasion and oxidation were present at a load of 10 N, which changes into delamination at a load of 50 N. ANOVA results show that the contributions of load, sliding distance and sliding speed were 12.99%, 83.04% and 3.97%, respectively. The artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regressor (SVR) and random forest (RF) methods were applied for the prediction of wear volume loss of AZ91 alloy. The correlation coefficient (R2) values of SVR, RF and ANN for the test were 0.9245, 0.9800 and 0.9845, respectively.

      " Abstract: Synopsis Epoetin (recombinant human erythropoietin) is a sialoglycoprotein hormone that appears to be immunologically and biologically equivalent to the endogenous compound, enhancing erythropoiesis dose-proportionally. The therapeutic efficacy of epoetin in thetreatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure has been established, with almost all patients responding with increases in haematocrit and haemoglobin levels, and improvements in quality of life. Some patients demonstrate relative epoetin resistance and require a higher dosage to achieve target haemoglobin and haematocrit levels. Maintenance of an adequate iron supply is essential and iron supplementation is recommended if serum ferritin is below 100 to 150 μg/L or transferrin saturation is less than 20%. The incidence of serious adverse effects may be reduced by maintaining a moderate rate of increase in the haematocrit with close monitoring of blood pressure and dialysis efficacy. Individual titration of epoetin dosage is recommended, with increases made in small increments to achieve haematocrit and haemoglobin levels of 30 to 33% and 10 to 12 g/dl, respectively, although the optimal haematocrit for each patient should be individually determined. Some patients will also require a modest increase in heparin dosage because of a possible increase in clotting tendency. Hypertension is the most common adverse effect in patients with chronic renal failure, occurring partially as a result of increasing blood viscosity and peripheral vascular resistance with the correction of anaemia. Maintenance epoetin therapy has been given for more than 2 years without a decrease in responsiveness and does not appear to adversely affect the outcome of renal transplantation. Thus, epoetin represents a significant therapeutic advance in the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure and should be considered a first option for these patients. Its potential value in the treatment of anaemia associated with other disorders and in facilitating autologous blood donation remains to be fully determined. Pharmacodynamic Studies Epoetin (recombinant human erythropoietin) stimulates proliferation and differentiation of committed erythroid progenitors dose-proportionally, with increases in reticulocyte count followed by rises in haematocrit and haemoglobin levels. In chronic haemodialysis patients red cell mass also increases but cell lifespan may remain considerably reduced. Tissue iron stores are mobilised during epoetin therapy, and iron supplementation to maintain erythropoiesis is recommended when serum ferritin is < 100 to 150 μg/L and/or transferrin saturation is < 20%; therapy has also been associated with modest increases in platelet and monocyte counts in some studies although these remain within normal limits. A reduction in bleeding times and improved platelet function have been correlated with rises in haematocrit in epoetin recipients receiving chronic haemodialysis, suggesting an improvement in the haemostatic defect found in these patients. Blood pressure may increase in epoetin recipients, particularly during induction therapy; however, limited evidence suggests that during maintenance epoetin therapy, some degree of haemodynamic adaptation to the increased haematocrit may occur. Improvements in left ventricular function and cardiac output appear to be less likely in patients with preexisting hypertension or in those who develop hypertension during epoetin therapy. Treatment of anaemic predialysis patients with epoetin has been successful, with improvements in exercise capacity similar to those observed in chronic haemodialysis patients, and although limited studies in animal models have suggested epoetin therapy may accelerate the progression of chronic renal failure, this has not been found clinically. Pharmacokinetic Studies The pharmacokinetics of epoetin when administered by intravenous, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal routes have been investigated, although published studies to date have been limited. Peak serum concentrations are observed immediately after intravenous epoetin administration, with concentrations of 3000 to 5000 mU/ml reported after single doses of 150 U/kg. Intravenous epoetin has a half-life of about 8 to 10 hours in chronic haemodialysis patients following single dose administration but this decreases to about 6 hours with repeated doses. In predialysis patients, the half-life of epoetin following repeated intravenous administration may be slightly reduced compared with that in patients receiving chronic haemodialysis. Peak serum concentrations are achieved 5 to 18 hours after subcutaneous epoetin administration and are maintained for several hours. There appears to be no difference in pharmacodynamic effects compared with intravenous administration despite the reduced bioavailability of subcutaneously administered drug. The pharmacokinetics of epoetin after intraperitoneal administration require further investigation. Although the sites of metabolism have not been established, evidence suggests the majority of a dose of epoetin is hepatically eliminated. Renal excretion plays a small role with up to 10% of erythropoietin excreted unchanged in the urine of normal volunteers. Therapeutic Trials Epoetin has been primarily investigated in short term uncontrolled trials as a treatment for anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in haemodialysis patients. Almost all patients have responded, with initial increases in haematocrit observed within 1 to 3 weeks and the rate of rise being dose proportional. Target haematocrit levels, which have varied between 30 and 40% in different studies, may be achieved within 4 to 6 weeks. Improvements in patient quality of life have included improved exercise tolerance, mood, sleep/wake patterns and sexual function. In controlled studies, epoetin recipients have shown significant increases in haematocrit and haemoglobin levels compared with pretreatment levels and with similar patients receiving androgen therapy, placebo or no treatment. Long term maintenance therapy remains to be fully evaluated but, in the experience reported to date, loss of responsiveness has not been observed and confirmed adverse effects on the outcome of renal transplantation have not been reported. Although most studies have used intravenous administration, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal routes also appear effective. Studies in patients with anaemia associated with chronic renal failure not requiring dialysis indicate that epoetin is also beneficial in this situation. Epoetin is also being evaluated for the treatment of anaemia associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), rheumatoid arthritis, prematurity, Gaucher’s disease, in sickle cell anaemia and in autologous blood donation. Adverse Effects Hypertension, occasionally with associated seizures, appears to be the major adverse effect in patients with chronic renal failure, and blood pressure should be closely monitored with prompt institution or dose adjustment of antihypertensive therapy as required. Vascular thrombotic events, particularly at dialysis access sites, have also been noted in epoetin recipients and some patients require a modest increase in heparin dosage. The incidence of cardiovascular and thrombotic adverse events directly attributable to epoetin therapy has not been fully determined, but does not appear to be above background levels in patients with chronic renal failure. Changes in electrolyte levels before dialysis have also been observed but adverse sequelae may be largely avoided by maintaining dialysis efficacy and dietary compliance. Other serious adverse effects are relatively uncommon. Significant cardiovascular or thrombotic adverse events associated with epoetin therapy were not observed in AIDS patients with anaemia associated with zidovudine (azidothymidine) therapy or in patients receiving epoetin to facilitate blood donation for later autologous transfusion. Dosage and Administration Although dosage is determined primarily by patient response, it is recommended that a relatively low epoetin dosage be employed initially (for example 50 to 100 U/kg intravenously 3 times weekly), increasing in small increments if significant rises in reticulocyte count, haematocrit and/or haemoglobin levels are not observed within 4 weeks. Epoetin dosage should be reduced if the haematocrit increases more than 4 points in any 2-week period. A target haematocrit of 30 to 33% and/or a target haemoglobin level of 10 to 12 g/dl is suggested, with maintenance therapy adjusted accordingly. However, the optimal haematocrit level for each patient should be determined individually. Epoetin is usually administered at the end of each dialysis session in long term haemodialysis patients. Subcutaneous epoetin administration appears to maintain target haemoglobin/haematocrit values at a dosage similar to that required intravenously, and may become the administration route of choice, particularly in patients not receiving haemodialysis. Intraperitoneal administration appears to require dosages similar to, or greater than, those used intravenously. Relative resistance to epoetin has been observed in patients with reduced iron stores, or with aluminium intoxication, osteitis fibrosa, infection or inflammation, but is usually overcome with iron supplementation or dosage increases, respectively. © 1989, ADIS Press Limited.

      " Abstract: Abstract.  7 patients completed 2 years of observation following initial therapy. Triplicate probing measurements were used to identify sites with ≥ 1 mm of probing attachment change between any 2 of the following time points; immediately pre‐instrumentation; immediately post‐instrumentation; 3 months; 12 months and 24 months. 24% of sites lost probing attachment directly due to instrumentation. 12% of sites lost probing attachment at 24 months compared to pre‐instrumentation, but over 1/3 of these lost attachment at the time of instrumentation. 47 sites lost probing attachment from post‐instrumentation to 24 months. 22 of these sites were shallow buccal or lingual sites and their attachment apparatus may have remodelled. The initially deeper of these sites displayed other clinical features more consistent with inflammatory periodontitis. Sites that initially gained probing attachment due to treatment but which later lost were identified. These sites may have had a reversal of the enhanced epithelial adaption. 17 other patients were monitored over a period of 31/2 years and sites losing probing attachment were identified using linear analysis of regression. The diagnostic predictability of clinical signs to reveal probing attachment loss at 31/2 years was calculated. In general, predictability values improved with increasing time interval. Increase in probing depth, particularly if combined with a high frequency of bleeding, showed the highest predictability. The effect of therapy on probing attachment levels should be considered in the identification of sites with probing attachment loss. Persistent bleeding, combined with high residual probing depths or increase in probing depth, may be a useful adjunct to probing attachment loss in identifying diseased sites.

      " Abstract: Primary familial brain calcification is a monogenic disease characterized by bilateral calcifications in the basal ganglia and other brain regions, and commonly presents motor, psychiatric, and cognitive symptoms. Currently, four autosomal dominant (SLC20A2, PDGFRB, PDGFB, XPR1) and one autosomal recessive (MYORG) causative genes have been identified. Compared with patients with autosomal dominant primary familial brain calcification, patients with the recessive form of the disease present with more severe clinical and imaging phenotypes, and deserve more clinical and research attention. Biallelic mutations in MYORG cannot explain all autosomal recessive primary familial brain calcification cases, indicating the existence of novel autosomal recessive genes. Using homozygosity mapping and whole genome sequencing, we detected a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.140delT, p.L48*) in the JAM2 gene in a consanguineous family with two affected siblings diagnosed with primary familial brain calcification. Further genetic screening in a cohort of 398 probands detected a homozygous start codon mutation (c.1A4G, p.M1?) and compound heterozygous mutations [c.504G4C, p.W168C and c.(67+1_68-1)_(394+1_395-1), p.Y23_V131delinsL], respectively, in two unrelated families. The clinical phenotypes of the four patients included parkinsonism (3/4), dysarthria (3/4), seizures (1/4), and probable asymptomatic (1/4), with diverse onset ages. All patients presented with severe calcifications in the cortex in addition to extensive calcifications in multiple brain areas (lenticular nuclei, caudate nuclei, thalamus, cerebellar hemispheres, ± brainstem; total calcification scores: 43–77). JAM2 encodes junctional adhesion molecule 2, which is highly expressed in neurovascular unit-related cell types (endothelial cells and astrocytes) and is predominantly localized on the plasma membrane. It may be important in cell-cell adhesion and maintaining homeostasis in the CNS. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, truncated His-tagged JAM2 proteins were detected by western blot following transfection of p.Y23_V131delinsL mutant plasmid, while no protein was detected following transfection of p.L48* or p.1M? mutant plasmids. In immunofluorescence experiments, the p.W168C mutant JAM2 protein failed to translocate to the plasma membrane. We speculated that mutant JAM2 protein resulted in impaired cell-cell adhesion functions and reduced integrity of the neurovascular unit. This is similar to the mechanisms of other causative genes for primary familial brain calcification or brain calcification syndromes (e.g. PDGFRB, PDGFB, MYORG, JAM3, and OCLN), all of which are highly expressed and functionally important in the neurovascular unit. Our study identifies a novel causative gene for primary familial brain calcification, whose vital function and high expression in the neurovascular unit further supports impairment of the neurovascular unit as the root of primary familial brain calcification pathogenesis. © The Author(s) (2019).

      " Abstract: Purpose - This is about the authors' son James' life. The purpose of this paper is to share a story ofmisfortune and a battle to find answers in which the greatest enemy was ignorance. Such experiences are not uncommon. It is the authors hope that sharing this will make some small contribution to bringing about change. Design/methodology/approach - The authors discuss the experiences of care placements, and the battle to understand \"challenging behaviour\". Findings - Reflecting upon James' experiences of the care system, it is clear that the system is fragmented and operates in silos that do not work together. Decision makers were all too often individuals not qualified to assess James' needs and therefore implement appropriate solutions. The outcome was repeated failure which resulted in the view that he was a lost cause. Originality/value - Such cruelty as James has experienced should be recognised and banished forever. © Emerald Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Perfecting one's swing has long been the golfer's dream. Thermo-Plastic carbon composite golf club shafts now meet the player halfway-placing a larger range of swing styles in the \"perfect\" category. When selecting a club from among the woods and irons, today's golfer has a new option- thermoplastics. Manufacture of the Thermo-Composite™ golf club shaft begins at the Taunton, Massachusetts, facility of Phoenixx TPC with a prepreg tape that has the graphite:resin ratio of 65:35. Phoenixx uses either linear polyphenylene sulphide (PPS) - Fortron® 0214B1 (by Ticona of Summit, New Jersey) - or polyamide 6 as the matrix resin. Various suppliers, including Hexcel and Toray, provide the carbon fibre reinforcement. Phoenixx, in turn, provides the thermoplastic prepreg tape to makers of industrial components-blades and vanes, bicycle components, and other products. When it began making the shafts in 1998, ease of manufacture was a factor in Phoenixx's choice of thermoplastic. Because it can reheat, reform and recycle this material, its production is feasible. The company can achieve consistency while processing with pultruded tape, due to the strength and stiffness of the PPS. Also, processing with helps when it is time to comply with air pollution restrictions. Yet another advantage is storage and shipping without the need to freeze thermoplastic. The resulting long shelf life and pot life reduce inventory loss due to out-of-date material and simplify inventory control.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The transition from comprehensive school to either an academic or a vocational track and from academic track to tertiary education are the key educational transitions during adolescence and young adulthood in many European educational systems. The present chapter approaches engagement and disengagement during these key educational transitions in the context of the 4-C (channelling, choice, co-regulation, compensation) life-span model of motivation and phase-adequate engagement model. In accordance with the life-span model of motivation and the phase-adequate engagement model, school transitions are triggers that channel the engagement and disengagement processes. The former process reflects school-related engagement, whereas disengagement is a key element of the school-burnout process. Engagement in the school context is defined as a positive, fulfilling work-related state of mind characterized by vigor and energy, dedication, and absorption. School burnout comprises three dimensions in terms of exhaustion due to school demands: a cynical and detached attitude toward the school, feelings of inadequacy as a student, and disengagement. Cynicism is manifest in an indifferent or distal attitude toward school work in general, a loss of interest in it, and not seeing it as meaningful. Inadequacy refers to a diminished sense of competence, achievement, and accomplishment as a student. Copyright © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

Based on the results of statistical analysis for each forage type and grazing pressure, GLEAMS performed better than WEPP, although either model did not predict sediment loss within an acceptable level. Because it was determined that grazing pressure had no significant impact on runoff and erosion from the experiment plots, the data for each forage were pooled over the same grazing pressure and the correlation between observed and simulated data were analyzed. This analysis showed that overall, predicted runoff values for both WEPP and GLEAMS had linear relationship to observed data. When sediment loss was analyzed, GLEAMS predicted value showed significant correlation with observed data, while WEPP predicted values did not.

      " Abstract: To make a significant contribution to halt global biodiversity losses, a worldwide breaking down of the IPBES findings at national scales is indispensable. So far, in some world regions and countries, this process is at the very beginning. Iran is a country with many different ecosystem types and high biodiversity. Still, the concept of ecosystem services (ES) has not yet been introduced as the main concept for policy and decision-making. We investigated the implementation of IPBES-oriented ES and biodiversity assessments for this country with desktop research. Based on a thorough literature review of Iranian publications, we answered this question “How can the IPBES framework be implemented in Iran?”. Our finding showed that there is a need to address the status of ES in the ecosystems of Iran using internationally accepted methods and frameworks. In order to facilitate the implementation of IPBES, we offer a main strategy as evaluation of ES for development programs in Iran. Based on the result, several organizations can contribute to IPBES capacity-building. Additionally, Iranian NGOs and local communities presenting the deliverables, activities and outputs to target audiences are under development to ensure implementation of comprehensive ES projects. Thus, we can improve communications and outreach for target stakeholders in ES projects in Iran. Based on this, we suggest the establishment of an Iranian stakeholders network (ISN) using a web-based infrastructure for ES assessment performance, participatory exercises, data sharing and information management in Iran. It seems that almost none of the stakeholders are aware of ES concepts, theories and policies, and this is a fundamental challenge in the implementation of the IPBES framework in Iran. Advanced work on policy support tools, methodologies, scenarios and models needs to develop a policy support web portal. In Iran, some non-governmental companies have sufficient capacity to perform it. The following organizations can help implement the strategy in different stages: Environmental organizations, local governments, science and technology ministry, power ministry, agricultural organizations, natural resources organizations, universities and research institutes. Also, local knowledge could be recognized and implemented as a participatory mechanism for strengthening the knowledge foundations of ES assessment in Iran. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Calves fed >0.7 kg of dry matter from milk replacer (MR) typically have greater growth preweaning but lower growth postweaning. This is partially explained by lower digestibility of starter due to less development of the rumen at and after weaning; however, it is unclear when digestibility matures postweaning to levels typical of mature ruminants. Thus, we fed Holstein calves (initially 2 to 3 d of age) 3 MR programs (MOD = 0.66 kg daily for 39 d, and then 0.33 kg daily for 3 d, n = 15 calves; HIMOD = 0.88 kg daily for 5 d, then 1.1 kg daily for 23 d, then 0.66 kg daily for 18 d, and then 0.33 kg daily for 3 d, n = 16 calves; HI = 0.88 kg daily for 5 d, then 1.1 kg daily for 37 d, and then 0.56 kg daily for 7 d, n = 15 calves). The MR consisted of 28% crude protein and 20% fat and was reconstituted to 14% solids and fed at 0630 and 1400 h daily. A 39% starch textured starter (19% crude protein) was fed free-choice for the first 56 d of a nursery trial with calves in individual pens. From 56 to 112 d, calves were grouped by MR program into pens of 3 to 4 calves and offered a starter with the same ingredient composition blended with 5% chopped grass hay for ad libitum consumption. Digestion was estimated at 11 and 16 wk. Measurements in the first and second 56 d were analyzed separately in a completely randomized design using repeated measurements when applicable. Preplanned contrasts of MOD versus HIMOD and MOD versus HI were used to separate means. Milk replacer dry matter intake was 26.6, 42.4, and 48.7 kg in calves fed MOD, HIMOD, and HI, respectively. Starter intake was less for calves fed HIMOD and HI versus MOD from 3 to 8 wk. Efficiency of metabolizable energy and protein used for body weight gain did not differ among programs. During the second 56 d, body weight gain and hip width changes were greater for calves fed MOD than HI. Total 112-d body weight gain and total hip width changes were 101.4, 101.3, and 101.7 kg, and 9.0, 9.1, and 8.7 cm for MOD, HIMOD, and HI, respectively. Digestibility of all nutrients except starch were greater at 16 versus 11 wk of age. Digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber were less for HI versus MOD at 11 wk of age explaining much of the why postweaning body weight gain advantages were lost postweaning in calves fed the HI program. Feeding more than 0.66 kg of dry matter intake from a MR during the preweaning phase did not increase total body weight or hip width gain from 0 to 4 mo of age. © 2016 American Dairy Science Association\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Critical exploration of family members' experience of the body of their deceased relative after a death in palliative care have been limited. To address this gap, we drew on semi-structured interviews at 6 months post loss with 58 family members bereaved after a death in palliative care, as part of a larger, longitudinal study conducted between 2016 and 2018. Narrative thematic analysis elucidated themes within and across participants' accounts of their experiences of the body. Social constructionist perspectives underpin recognition of the processes of grieving family members. Within an overarching theme of social meanings of the dead, five themes pertained to individual, relational, and contextual dimensions of interactions with the body, including: a dual sense of the body still holding the person and as just a body; family's experiences of the body both at home and in formal care settings; expectations around the right amount of time to be with and leave the body. Accounts also revealed their sense of knowing or not knowing what to do with the dead and elements of preparation of the body and management of the family and body by professional caregivers, with differences for deaths at home and deaths in formal settings. Findings highlight the importance of facilitating family and individual preferences, and options around care, place, and time with the body.

      " Abstract: Purpose: Ejaculatory function remains a major concern for patients with low stage nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of the testis. Whereas, it has been extensively studied in patients undergoing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, preservation of ejaculatory function on surveillance protocols has not been studied. Materials and Methods: To appropriately compare ejaculatory function for surveillance protocols to primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection, we constructed a decision analysis model mimicking the standard treatment algorithm for stage 1 nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis. The primary clinical payoff for this study is ejaculatory function. Results: Based on this model, we established that a primary nerve sparing retroperitoneal dissection must be performed with a 96.8% ejaculatory function rate to be recommended as the appropriate therapy. However, if a highly skilled surgeon routinely performs post-chemotherapy dissection with an ejaculatory function rate of 69.2% or greater, surveillance should be offered as the primary treatment modality. This result simply demonstrates a high skill level to allow the surgeon to salvage ejaculatory function in post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection settings. If this level cannot be achieved, primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection is the best choice. If we account for a 10% loss of ejaculatory function from primary chemotherapy, the minimum ejaculatory function rate for primary retroperitoneal dissection decreases to 95.7%. In the post-chemotherapy setting an 85.7% ejaculatory function rate must be achieved for surveillance to be considered the optimal choice. Clearly, less surgical rigor is needed with a primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection when correcting for the effects of chemotherapy on ejaculatory function. Despite this fact, 1-way sensitivity analysis revealed that our model is insensitive to the ejaculatory function effects of chemotherapy. Furthermore, if the likelihood of recurrence on surveillance is greater than 16%, primary nerve sparing retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should again be recommended. Conclusions: Thus, to maximize ejaculatory function for patients with stage 1 nonseminomatous germ cell tumor a nerve sparing primary retroperitoneal lymph node dissection should always be performed, unless the likelihood of recurrence on surveillance is low or the surgical skill level allows for a highly successful post chemotherapy nerve sparing dissection.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Due to the private ownerships of various resource and equipment in a microgrid, it is essential to design a proper power trading strategy for a mutually satisfying partnership among suppliers and users. This paper proposes a novel discounted min-consensus algorithm to discover the optimal electrical power trading route with minimal power loss in dc microgrids. The proposed distributed algorithm only requires information exchange among neighbors based on a peer-to-peer communication protocol, which is robust to topology changes and enables parallel data processing to achieve fast decision-making. The convergence and optimality of the proposed discounted min-consensus algorithm are guaranteed by rigorous analysis. Simulation results of the 10-bus, 68-bus, and 1062-bus power systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed optimal routing strategy for electrical power trading. Moreover, the proposed novel distributed algorithm sheds light on applying distributed control and optimization approaches to solve problems arising in artificial intelligence. © 2019 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Breastfeeding is a natural contraceptive against another pregnancy. The longer the mother nurses, the longer she delays the return of fertility. A natural mechanism triggered by breastfeeding interrupted Ms. El-Hady's monthly cycle of ovulation and menstruation. Depending on how long and how often she suckles her child, this infertility, termed lactational amenorrhea, could last as long as 2 years. This traditional method of spacing births offers protection against pregnancy to more women than all other methods of contraception combined, according to family planning researchers. With growing trends away from breastfeeding, the traditional practice is losing its impact on fertility. Not many women in Egypt use modern contraceptives. There is little understanding of lactational amenorrhea, but researchers are giving it more attention as they continue to search for effective family planning methods appropriate to the needs and circumstances of the rural population. They know that the effect is only temporary and varies from woman to woman. Ms. El-Hady has been amenorrheic for 15 months, but other women experience much shorter periods of amenorrhea, and some none at all. The secretion of milk is promoted by a hormone called prolactin that the anterior pituitary gland produces in large quantities during pregnancy. The frequency and duration of breastfeeding appear to determine the length of amenorrhea, although the mother's nutrition and any other type of contraceptive used may also play a role. Each month for 2 years, Dr. Olfat Darwish, professor of nutrition at the University of Alexandria's High Institute of Public Health, has visited 260 rural mothers and 290 urban mothers to gather data on diet, breastfeeding practices, state of amenorrhea, and use of contraception. The length of the breastfeeding period was found to affect the duration of amenorrhea. Early weaning brought an earlier return of ovulation and menstruation, and thus of fertility. The nutritional status of the mothers did not appear to affect the length of the period of amenorrhea. An understanding of how the mechanism operates and what its limitations are will enable family planners to offer women an additional contraceptive choice.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynaecological cancers in developed countries. Its incidence has increased 20% over the last decade and the death rate has increased >100% over the past two decades. Current models for prediction of prognosis and treatment response are suboptimal, and as such biomarkers to support clinical decision-making and contribute to individualised treatment are needed. In this study, we show that the E3-ubiquitin ligase PIR2/RNF144B is a potential targetable biomarker in endometrial cancer. At transcript level, it is expressed both in normal endometrium and tumour samples, but at protein level, it is expressed in tumours only. By using endometrial cancer cell lines, we demonstrated that PIR2/RNF144B is stabilised via phosphorylation downstream of GSK3β and this is necessary for the proliferation of endometrial cancer cells, in the absence of oestrogenic growth stimuli. Here, inactivation of GSK3β activity is associated with loss of PIR2/RNF144B protein and consequent inhibition of cell proliferation. Our results, therefore, substantiate PIR2/RNF144B as a novel candidate for targeted therapy in endometrial cancer. © 2018 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Due to the influence of decoherence, the quantum state probably evolves from the initial pure state to the mixed state, resulting in loss of fidelity, coherence and purity, which is deteriorating for quantum information transmission. Thus, in quantum engineering, quantum control should not only realize the transfer and track of quantum states through manipulation of the external electromagnetic field but also enhance the robustness against decoherence. In this paper, we aim to design a control law to steer the system into the sliding mode domain and maintain it in that domain when bounded uncertainties exist in the system Hamiltonian. We first define the required control performance by fidelity, degree of coherence and purity in terms of the uncertainty of the Hamiltonian in Markovian open quantum system. By characterizing the required robustness using a sliding mode domain, a sampled-data design method is introduced for decoherence control in the quantum system. Furthermore, utilizing the sampled data, a control scheme has been designed on the basis of sliding mode control, and the choice of sampling operator and driving of quantum state during the sampling by the Lyapunov control method are discussed. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Widespread adoption of renewable energy technologies will arguably benefit from the availability of economically viable distributed thermal power conversion systems. For this reason, considerable efforts have been dedicated in recent years to R&D over mini-organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power plants, thus with a power capacity approximately in the 3-50 kW range. The application of these systems for waste heat recovery from diesel engines of long-haul trucks stands out because of the possibility of achieving economy of production. Many technical challenges need to be solved, as the system must be sufficiently efficient, light, and compact. The design paradigm is therefore completely different from that of conventional stationary ORC power plants of much larger capacity. A high speed turbine is arguably the expander of choice, if high conversion efficiency is targeted, thus high maximum cycle temperature. Given the lack of knowledge on the design of these turbines, which depends on a large number of constraints, a novel optimal design method integrating the preliminary design of the thermodynamic cycle and that of the turbine has been developed. The method is applicable to radial inflow, axial and radial outflow turbines, and to superheated and supercritical cycle configurations. After a limited number of working fluids are selected, the feasible design space is explored by means of thermodynamic cycle design calculations integrated with a simplified turbine design procedure, whereby the isentropic expansion efficiency is prescribed. Starting from the resulting design space, optimal preliminary designs are obtained by combining cycle calculations with a 1D mean-line code, subject to constraints. The application of the procedure is illustrated for a test case: the design of turbines to be tested in a new experimental setup named organic rankine cycle hybrid integrated device (ORCHID) which is being constructed at the Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands. The first turbine selected for further design and construction employs siloxane MM (hexamethyldisiloxane, C6H18OSi2), supercritical cycle, and the radial inflow configuration. The main preliminary design specifications are power output equal to 11.6 kW, turbine inlet temperature equal to 300°C, maximum cycle pressure equal to 19.9 bar, expansion ratio equal to 72, rotational speed equal to 90 krpm, inlet diameter equal to 75 mm, minimum blade height equal to 2 mm, degree of reaction equal to 0.44, and estimated total-to-static efficiency equal to 77.3%. Results of the design calculations are affected by considerable uncertainty related to the loss correlations employed for the preliminary turbine design, as they have not been validated yet for this highly unconventional supersonic and transonic mini turbine. Future work will be dedicated to the extension of the method to encompass the preliminary design of heat exchangers and the off-design operation of the system.

      " Abstract: Insect courtship and mating depend on integration of olfactory, visual, and tactile cues. Compared to other insects, Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm, has relatively simple sexual behaviors as it cannot fly. Here by using CRISPR/Cas9 and electrophysiological techniques we found that courtship and mating behaviors are regulated in male silk moths by mutating genes in the sex determination cascade belonging to two conserved pathways. Loss of Bmdsx gene expression significantly reduced the peripheral perception of the major pheromone component bombykol by reducing expression of the product of the BmOR1 gene which completely blocked courtship in adult males. Interestingly, we found that mating behavior was regulated independently by another sexual differentiation gene, Bmfru. Loss of Bmfru completely blocked mating, but males displayed normal courtship behavior. Lack of Bmfru expression significantly reduced the perception of the minor pheromone component bombykal due to the down regulation of BmOR3 expression; further, functional analysis revealed that loss of the product of BmOR3 played a key role in terminating male mating behavior. Our results suggest that Bmdsx and Bmfru are at the base of the two primary pathways that regulate olfactory-based sexual behavior. © 2020 Xu et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

Previous studies have shown that reading performance in peripheral vision can improve with extensive practice on a trigram letter-recognition task. The present study compared training on this task with training on two other character-based tasks (lexical-decision and Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) reading) which might plausibly produce more improvement in peripheral reading speed. Twenty-eight normally-sighted young adults were trained at 10° in the lower visual field in a pre/post design. All three training methods produced significant improvements in reading speed, with average gains of 39% for lexical-decision, 54% for trigram letter-recognition, and 72% for RSVP training. Although the RSVP training was most effective, the lexical-decision task has the advantage of easy self administration making it more practical for home-based training. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

      " Abstract: Structural (or social) balance is regarded as a fundamental social process. It has been used to explain how the feelings, attitudes and beliefs, which the social actors have towards each other, promotes the formation of stable (but not necessarily conflict free) social groups. While balance theory has a rich and long history, it has lost favor in recent times. The empirical work has taken one of two forms. Most empirical work on social balance has focused on dyads and triples, and findings have been inconsistent. The remaining studies focus on the structure of the group as a whole. Results here have been inconsistent also. One major problem is that the first line of work is based only on the source ideas of Heider while the second has been based only on the ideas of Cartwright and Harary. Some of the inconsistencies may be due to this empirical split where the two streams of ideas do not inform each other. We propose a new theoretical model for social balance in the form of an agent-based simulation model. The results we present account for several of the inconsistencies found in the literature. The model simulates distinct but interdependent social actors making positive and negative selections of each other in efforts to reach balanced cognitive states. The design variables for the simulations are group size, degree of contentiousness of a group and the mode of communicating choices regarding the existence and sign of social ties. The group level balance mechanism used by the dynamic model is based on the idea of partition balance, as proposed by Doreian and Mrvar [Soc. Netw. 18 (1996) 149]. Actor selections, over time, generate networks that partition group members into stable, balanced subsets at equilibrium or near equilibrium. The design variables have complicated impacts on the number of actor choices made to reach balance, the level of group imbalance, the number of actors with balanced images and the number of plus-sets formed. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

      " Abstract: The banana root borer, Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a major pest in many banana (Musa spp.)- producing regions of the world, causing yield losses of up to 100%. The aims of this study were to define the spatial distribution pattern of C. sordidus in banana plantations, to determine the probability distribution model that best describes the sampling data, and to develop a sequential sampling plan for this pest. Aggregation was investigated using aggregation indices and theoretical frequency distributions. To quantify the number of insects, 80 traps were distributed in a commercial banana plantation with an area of 4 ha and inspections were performed every 2 wk from 2005 to 2008. The sequential sampling plan was based on Wald’s sequential probability ratio test. The calculated indices indicated moderate aggregation, with a common k parameter of the negative binomial distribution equal to 3.29. The best model for predicting the spatial distribution of the insects was the negative binomial distribution, which fit 93% of the inspections, followed by the Neyman Type A distribution, which fit 90% of the surveys, and Poisson’s distribution, which fit only one survey. A sequential sampling plan was generated with Type I and II error rates of 5%, for which 19 was the maximum expected number of samples required to reach a decision for an infestation mean of approximately 3.7 insects per trap. The validation showed that the constructed plan is reliable and provides correct recommendations for decision-making in pest control. © 2016 by the American Society of Agronomy.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Pivmecillinam (amdinocillin pivoxil) is the recommended first-choice antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections (UTIs) in Denmark. The frequency of mutation to mecillinam (MEC) resistance is described as high in vitro; however, treatment of UTI has a good clinical response and prevalence of mecillinam resistance in Escherichia coli remains low despite many years of use. We describe occurrence of in vivo mecillinam resistance in a clinical isolate of ESBL-producing E. coli following pivmecillinam treatment. The identified phenotypic differences in the mecillinam resistant isolate compared with the original mecillinam susceptible isolate were a full-length LPS with O-antigen (O25), mecillinam resistance and a lower MIC for ceftazidime. Regarding genotype, the resistant isolate differed with a mutation in blaCTX-M-15 to blaCTX-M-127, loss of a part of a plasmid and a genomic island, respectively, and insertion of a transposase in wbbL, causing the rough phenotype. The observed mecillinam resistance is expected to be caused by the mutation in blaCTX-M-15 with additional contribute from the serotype shift. We continue to recommend the use of pivmecillinam as first-line treatment for UTI. © 2019 The Authors. MicrobiologyOpen published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The standard size of bougie for laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is not yet established. Therefore, a systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted to assess the weight loss effects and associated complications of LSG for patients with morbid obesity, based on different bougie sizes. A total of 15 studies were reviewed in this systemic review and network meta-analysis (2,848 participants), including RCTs and retrospective studies in PubMed, and Embase until September 1, 2020. The effectiveness of different bougie calibration sizes was assessed based on excess weight loss (EWL), total complications, and staple line leak. Within this network meta-analysis, S-sized (≤ 32 Fr.) and M-sized (33–36 Fr.) bougies had similar effects and were associated with the highest EWL improvement among all different bougie sizes (S-sized: standardized mean difference [SMD], 10.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] − 5.59 to − 26.63, surface under the cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA], 0.78; and M-sized: SMD, 10.16; 95% CI − 3.04–23.37; SUCRA, 0.75). M-sized bougie was associated with the lowest incidence of total complications (M-sized: odds ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.16–1.11; SUCRA, 0.92).

      " Abstract: It is well recognized that batch effect in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data remains a big challenge when integrating different datasets. Here, we proposed deepMNN, a novel deep learning-based method to correct batch effect in scRNA-seq data. We first searched mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) pairs across different batches in a principal component analysis (PCA) subspace. Subsequently, a batch correction network was constructed by stacking two residual blocks and further applied for the removal of batch effects. The loss function of deepMNN was defined as the sum of a batch loss and a weighted regularization loss. The batch loss was used to compute the distance between cells in MNN pairs in the PCA subspace, while the regularization loss was to make the output of the network similar to the input. The experiment results showed that deepMNN can successfully remove batch effects across datasets with identical cell types, datasets with non-identical cell types, datasets with multiple batches, and large-scale datasets as well. We compared the performance of deepMNN with state-of-the-art batch correction methods, including the widely used methods of Harmony, Scanorama, and Seurat V4 as well as the recently developed deep learning-based methods of MMD-ResNet and scGen. The results demonstrated that deepMNN achieved a better or comparable performance in terms of both qualitative analysis using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots and quantitative metrics such as batch and cell entropies, ARI F1 score, and ASW F1 score under various scenarios. Additionally, deepMNN allowed for integrating scRNA-seq datasets with multiple batches in one step. Furthermore, deepMNN ran much faster than the other methods for large-scale datasets. These characteristics of deepMNN made it have the potential to be a new choice for large-scale single-cell gene expression data analysis. © Copyright © 2021 Zou, Zhang, Zhou, Jiang, Yang, Jin and Bai.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Cardiac surgery is a major consumer of blood products, and hemodilution increases transfusion requirements during cardiac surgery under CPB. As intraoperative parenteral fluids contribute to hemodilution, we evaluated the hypothesis that intraoperative fluid restriction reduces packed red-cell (PRC) use, especially in transfusion-prone adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery.Methods: 192 patients were randomly assigned to restrictive (group A, 100 pts), or liberal (group B, 92 pts) intraoperative intravenous fluid administration. All operations were conducted by the same team (same surgeon and perfusionist). After anesthesia induction, intravenous fluids were turned off in Group A (fluid restriction) patients, who only received fluids if directed by protocol. In contrast, intravenous fluid administration was unrestricted in group B. Transfusion decisions were made by the attending anesthesiologist, based on identical transfusion guidelines for both groups.Results: 137 of 192 patients received 289 PRC units in total. Age, sex, weight, height, BMI, BSA, LVEF, CPB duration and surgery duration did not differ between groups. Fluid balance was less positive in Group A. Fewer group A patients (62/100) required transfusion compared to group B (75/92, p < 0.04). Group A patients received fewer PRC units (113) compared to group B (176; p < 0.0001). Intraoperatively, the number of transfused units and transfused patients was lower in group A (31 u in 19 pts vs. 111 u in 62 pts; p < 0.001). Transfusions in ICU did not differ significantly between groups. Transfused patients had higher age, lower weight, height, BSA and preoperative hematocrit, but no difference in BMI or discharge hematocrit. Group B (p < 0.005) and female gender (p < 0.001) were associated with higher transfusion probability. Logistic regression identified group and preoperative hematocrit as significant predictors of transfusion.Conclusions: Our data suggest that fluid restriction reduces intraoperative PRC transfusions without significantly increasing postoperative transfusions in cardiac surgery; this effect is more pronounced in transfusion-prone patients.Trial registration: NCT00600704, at the United States National Institutes of Health. © 2010 Vretzakis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: On a gambling task that models real-life decisions, patients with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VM) opt for choices that yield high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. In this study, we addressed three possibilities that may account for this behaviour: (i) hypersensitivity to reward; (ii) insensitivity to punishment; and (iii) insensitivity to future consequences, such that behaviour is always guided by immediate prospects. For this purpose, we designed a variant of the original gambling task in which the advantageous decks yielded high immediate punishment but even higher future reward. The disadvantageous decks yielded low immediate punishment but even lower future reward. We measured the skin conductance responses (SCRs) of subjects after they had received a reward or punishment. Patients with VM lesions opted for the disadvantageous decks in both the original and variant versions of the gambling task. The SCRs of VM lesion patients after they had received a reward or punishment were not significantly different from those of controls. In a second experiment, we investigated whether increasing the delayed punishment in the disadvantageous decks of the original task or decreasing the delayed reward in the disadvantageous decks of the variant task would shift the behaviour of VM lesion patients towards an advantageous strategy. Both manipulations failed to shift the behaviour of VM lesion patients away from the disadvantageous decks. These results suggest that patients with VM lesions are insensitive to future consequences, positive or negative, and are primarily guided by immediate prospects. This 'myopia for the future' in VM lesion patients persists in the face of severe adverse consequences, i.e. rising future punishment or declining future reward.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The viability of applying Sensorineural Acuity Level (SAL) audiometry to auditory brain stem response (ABR) testing was investigated using 38 subjects with normal hearing, conductive, sensorineural, and mixed hearing losses. The stimuli were clicks, 4000, 2000, and 1000 Hz tone-pips. After ABR thresholds (ABRJ were obtained, bone-conducted noise was used to mask the response to a stimulus 5 dB above ABR threshold (ABRt + 5). Estimates of behavioral bone-conduction thresholds were made by observing the amount of noise needed to mask ABR, + 5. Estimates of behavioral air-conduction thresholds were based upon ABRt. Results indicated that ABR, was within fl0 dB of behavioral air-conduction threshold across subject groups at least 74% of the time for all tone-pip stimuli. ABRt was within k 15 dB of the pure-tone average of 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz 75% of the time when click stimuli were used. Derived bone-conduction thresholds were within f 10 dB of the actual bone-conduction threshold at least 73% of the time for all stimuli. It was concluded that, when used in a conservative manner, the application of SAL audiometry to ABR testing may increase the reliability and confidence with which decisions are made concerning the type and degree of hearing loss in difficult-to-test patients. © 1983 by The Williams & Wilkins Co.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aim: Although the pilonidal sinus disease is commonly treated with surgical methods, search for optimal surgical procedures and minimally invasive methods continues. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inverted 'ᗡ' technique which provides a tension-free closure with minimal tissue loss, by comparing with the classical open surgery technique. Material and Methods: Sixty-five patients, 37 (56.9%) male and 28 (43.1%) female, with a mean age of 15.85±1.82 years, admitted between January 2014 and October 2020 and underwent inverted 'ᗡ' surgery and classical midline open surgery were retrospectively evaluated. Results: As an early postoperative complication, bleeding was observed in 2 (7.4%) patients in inverted 'ᗡ' group and 3 (11.1%) patients had wound infection. The same complications were 4 (10.5%) and 4 (10.5%) in classical group, respectively. The time to return to full activities was statistically different between two groups (10.36±0.43 versus 11.30±0.93 days, p<0.001). During the follow-up period, 1 (3.7%) recurrence in the inverted 'ᗡ' group and 9 (23.7%) recurrences in the classical group were statistically significant (p=0.037). Conclusion: The present technique aims to remove the pathological tissue that causes sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease by the subcutaneous surgical work area under the flap created through the 'ᗡ' incision and to close it without tension, away from the midline without tissue loss. We believe that the operation involving the 'ᗡ' incision and primary suture method should be considered as the first choice in the pediatric patient group because of being a simple and effective surgical technique for sacrococcygeal pilonidal disease treatment. © 2021, Duzce University Medical School.

      " Abstract: The past decade has witnessed the success of transformed domain methods for image saliency prediction. However, it is intractable to develop a transformed domain method for video saliency prediction, due to the limited choices on spatio-temporal transforms. In this paper, we propose learning the transform from training data, rather than the predefined transform in the existing methods. Specifically, we develop a novel deep Complex-valued network with learnable Transform (DeepCT) for video saliency prediction. The architecture of DeepCT includes the Complex-valued Transform Module (CTM), inverse CTM (iCTM) and Complex-valued Stacked Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory network (CS-ConvLSTM). In the CTM and iCTM, multi-scale pyramid structures are introduced, as we find that transforms at multiple receptive scales can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. To make the CTM and iCTM “invertible”, we further propose the cycle consistency loss in training DeepCT, which is composed of frame reconstruction loss and complex feature reconstruction loss. Additionally, the CS-ConvLSTM is developed to learn the temporal saliency transition across video frames. Finally, the experimental results show that our DeepCT method outperforms other 13 state-of-the-art methods for video saliency prediction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Many transplant centers require that patients maintain a BMI below 40 kg/m2 in order to be eligible for listing, rendering many morbidly obese patients with end-stage liver disease unable to access liver transplantation as a method of treatment. In order to determine the safest and most efficacious weight loss regimen in this challenging population, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), and diet and exercise were modeled to assess their impact on life expectancy in morbidly obese patients with cirrhosis. A Markov state transition model was developed to assess the survival benefit of undergoing RYGB, AGB, or 1 year of diet and exercise in morbidly obese patients with compensated cirrhosis. A base case analysis of no weight loss intervention in a 45-year-old patient with compensated cirrhosis and a BMI of 45 kg/m2 revealed an average survival of 7.93 years. The average survival for the weight loss simulations was 9.14, 8.84, and 8.16 years for RYGB, AGB, and diet and exercise, respectively. In morbidly obese patients with compensated cirrhosis, RYGB allows patients to lose more weight more rapidly than is probable with either AGB or diet and exercise, thus having the greatest impact on survival. © 2013 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract.\u001b[0m :\n",

If not possible, conservative therapy is frequently the next option, leaving the guide wire in place. This case describes the consequence of such an approach 9 months after initial percutaneous coronary intervention. The guide wire migrated through the abdominal cavity and finally perforated the heart. We therefore defend a more aggressive approach if a guide wire is locked in or lost.

      " Abstract: Indirect effects resulting from natural disasters, such as the follow-on consequences of initial destruction, are attracting growing attention. This is because economic losses in the aftermath of disaster events have escalated in recent years and are expected to continue to rise in the future. Despite this, the primary focus of most countries’ disaster risk management approaches remains centered on mitigating the direct effects of such events, with little attention being paid to strategies aimed explicitly at reducing indirect effects. As a result, there are limited practical solutions available for reducing these indirect damages. Most efforts remain theoretical, lacking real-world testing of frameworks specifically designed to reduce indirect risks. To address this gap, this paper aims to illuminate the issue by proposing and empirically testing how existing risk management frameworks designed for direct risks could be expanded to encompass indirect effects as well. In doing so, we create and use a framework to manage indirect risks in a collaborative process for dealing with major flood risk in Austria. We test specific challenges and explore ways to integrate the management of these indirect risks in a complex real-world scenario. Our findings suggest that linking indirect and direct risk management can be achieved with relatively modest effort. A precise systems definition proves particularly beneficial in this regard, as it can link disaster risk related dimensions with non-disaster related targets. This approach thereby opens up the possibility to explicitly include multiple dividends in the decision-making process about indirect risk management strategies. © 2024 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

Both physical and socioeconomic variables were considered, and the comparison between physical vulnerability and economic vulnerability was conducted to identify effects of socioeconomic variables on coastal susceptibility to sea level rise. The assessment was carried out at shoreline segments scale as well as at county-level scale, and the results were as follows: The combination of geomorphology and terrain plays the determinant role, since the gently sloped coasts with softer substances are always both physical and economic susceptible to the projected inundation scenario; potential displaced population and GDP loss have more influence on economic vulnerability than reclamation density in that the most intensively reclaimed areas are not always high vulnerable, while the areas that may suffer from the largest potential displaced population and GDP loss are always high vulnerable; the method employed in this study is sensitive in identifying the relative difference in economic vulnerability; moreover, it is capable of handling the issues caused by mutual offset effects between land-controlling impacts and marine-controlling impacts.

An agile project contains planned processes as well as iterations. In global competitive areas, achieving agility in outsourcing processes enables the companies to cope with changes and dynamic issues. This paper introduces an integrated cognitive map-based intuitionistic fuzzy multiple criteria decision aid to rank agile outsourcing provider alternatives and then determine the best performing one. Intuitionistic fuzzy sets are employed for dealing with uncertain and vague data along with the loss of information that may be occurred in numerical operations with fuzzy numbers. Intuitionistic fuzzy cognitive map tool is used to weight the evaluation criteria that are interrelated with each other with causal links. The most appropriate agile outsourcing provider alternative is identified via intuitionistic fuzzy complex proportional assessment technique, which aims to obtain a solution relative to the ideal solution. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed intuitionistic fuzzy decision aid, a case study is conducted in Turkish white goods industry. As a comparative study, a scenario analysis is provided to understand the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on agile provider evaluation/selection decision.

They prove that Pareto optimality, ordinal invariance, ordinal symmetry, and IIA characterize this solution. A feature of their work is that attention is restricted to a domain of social choice problems with an infinite set of basic allocations. We introduce an alternative approach to solving finite social choice problems using a new notion called the Ordinal Egalitarian (OE) bargaining solution. This suggests the middle ranked allocation (or a lottery over the two middle ranked allocations) of the Pareto set as an outcome. We show that the OE solution is characterized by weak credible optimality, ordinal symmetry and independence of redundant alternatives. We conclude by arguing that what allows us to make progress on this problem is that with finite choice sets, the counting metric is a natural and fully ordinal way to measure gains and losses to agents seeking to solve bargaining problems. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Based on recent developments and the predicted future advancement of lighting tech-nologies, researchers are now questioning the extent to which daylight is effective in lowering the overall energy consumption of buildings. As light-emitting diode (LED) luminaires are highly energy efficient, the amount of power consumed for lighting purposes can be reduced, even in situations where the lighting system is at its full power. It has already been demonstrated that LED-lighting technologies can facilitate significant energy savings through minimizing window size (the main source of heat loss in buildings), and there is considerable potential for developing the LEDs’ source efficacy and lighting-product efficiency to ultimately achieve levels of efficacy of approximately 350 lumens per Watt (lm/W). For building designs to be sustainable in the future, it is critical that the windows-to-wall ratio (WWR) is optimized to minimize both heating and cooling loads, as well as the total energy consumed by the building for lighting, according to the efficiency of the LED, while still maintaining a suitable lighting level for occupants. This research examines the influence of the WWR on the total amount of energy consumed by standard buildings in Jordan using various LED luminaires (existing and projected efficiencies). DesignBuilder software was utilized to analyze the effect of LED-technology development on optimizing the WWR for a typical residential structure in Jordan. The research presents beneficial recommendations with respect to optimizing the WWR for primary decision-makers in the design of residential buildings with enhanced energy efficiency, considering the losses and gains associated with solar heat and light to capitalize on solar energy with no adverse impacts by windows size. The outcomes suggest a WWR of 17% could be achieved by typical residential buildings in Jordan that have extremely efficient LED lighting systems (350 lm/W), which is more than 50% less than the existing level of 40% recommended by multiple standards. Additionally, this study highlighted that when the efficiency of LED technologies increases, the energy demand of the building will be reduced because of lower energy usage combined with heat gain resulting from the LED efficiency. © 2021 by the authors.

Aimed at measuring OCER, the current paper proposes an approach in which the achievements of environmental control implemented by a production unit are considered. We quantify and define the achievements as «desirable» environmental outputs. In this way, for a production unit, producing normal desirable outputs and reaching environmental outputs is a tradeoff. OCER is measured by calculating a maximum amount of increasable normal outputs when production units do not need to produce any environmental outputs. Directional distance functions and data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques are used to calculate OCER. The approach is applied to an empirical illustration based on Taiwan's port industry covering the period 2001-2007. It is found that the industry incurred opportunity costs due to environmental regulations equivalent to 1.8% of total revenue it creates.

Excess iodine as well as iodine deficiency may promote thyroid cancer. Therefore, knowledge of iodine content and distribution within thyroid cancer tissue is of interest. X-ray fluorescence analysis (XRF) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) are two methods that can be used to assess iodine content in thyroid tissue. With both techniques, choice of sample preparation affects the results. Aldehyde fixatives are required for SIMS analysis while a freezing method might be satisfactory for XRF analysis. The aims of the present study were primarily to evaluate a simple freezing technique for preserving samples for XRF analysis and also to use XRF to evaluate the efficacy of using aldehyde fixatives to prepare samples for SIMS analysis. Ten porcine thyroids were sectioned into four pieces that were either frozen or fixed in formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, or a modified Karnovsky fixative. The frozen samples were assessed for iodine content with XRF after 1 and 2 months, and the fixed samples were analyzed for iodine content after 1 week.

Methods: A cross-sectional study of office workers, heavy manual workers not exposed to HTV and workers with hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Sensory perception was measured in the digits by SWM using a forced-choice method to determine variability by sex, age, hand and digit. Frequency distributions were used to determine limit values and linear weighted kappa for intra-digit variability. Poisson regression was used to explore the relationship between sensory perception by SWM and abnormalities of thermal and vibration perception in the hands of workers with HAVS. Results: The sensory perception threshold of office workers did not vary by hand or digit. It was significantly lower in women < 30 than women aged ≥ 30 years. The 95th percentile for heavy manual workers was 1.00 (95% CI 0.60–1.00) and significantly higher than for office workers at 0.16 (95% CI 0.16–0.16). Heavy manual workers > 50 years had the highest threshold at 1.40 (95% CI 1.00–2.00). Weighted kappa for reliability was 0.63 (95% CI 0.53–0.70). A mean SWM threshold of ≥ 1.0 gram-force had a 79% sensitivity and 64% specificity for detecting abnormalities of thermal and vibration perception in the ipsilateral index and little fingers of workers with HAVS.

Methods: Data were collected through focus group discussions in 12 villages with four in Bassila (semi-arid Sudano-Guinean region) and eight in Boukoumbé (arid Sudanian region). Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 180 farmers (90 in each region). Species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index were estimated based on presence-absence data obtained from the focus group discussions using species accumulation curves. Results: Our results indicated that 115 species belonging to 48 families and 92 genera were used to address food security. Overall, wild species represent 61% of edible plants collected (60% in the semi-arid area and 54% in the arid area). About 25% of wild edible plants were under domestication. Edible species richness and diversity in the semi-arid area were significantly higher than in the arid area. However, farmers in the arid area have developed advanced resource-conserving practices compared to their counterparts in the semi-arid area where slash-and-burn cultivation is still ongoing, resulting in natural resources degradation and loss of biodiversity. There is no significant difference between the two areas for cultivated species richness. The interplay of socio-cultural attributes and agroecological conditions explains the diversity of food plants selected by communities. Conclusions: We conclude that if food security has to be addressed, the production and consumption policies must be re-oriented toward the recognition of the place of wild edible plants. For this to happen we suggest a number of policy and strategic decisions as well as research and development actions such as a thorough documentation of wild edible plants and their contribution to household diet, promotion of the ''bringing into cultivation\" practices, strengthening of livestock-crop integration. © Segnon and Achigan-Dako; licensee BioMed Central.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach is very rare. Its pathogenesis is unclear and the treatment strategy is controversial. We report an agressive primary squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach with liver and lung metastases in a 55-year-old man. The patient presented with a 1-month history of abdominal pain, vomiting and weight loss. Abdominal ultrasound revealed multiple liver metastases. Endoscopic examination showed two tumour masses on the fundus of the stomach. Biopsy of the lesions revealed squamous cell carcinoma of the stomach. Chest x-ray showed multiple large pulmonary nodules highly suggestive of pulmonary metastases. The patient died ten days after he was admitted because of progression of the tumour and before any therapeutic decision. © 2015, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

      " Abstract: Objective: This study aimed to report pediatric cochlear reimplantation data focusing on failure of the device and to assess surgical challenges and functional outcomes. Methods: Retrospective case review from 1990 to 2012. Tertiary referral academic center. A retrospective review of medical and surgical records, audiologic results, and report of the manufacturer's analysis was performed. The causes of revision cochlear implantation were divided into hard failure and soft failure. Results compared speech perception in open set or closed set words before and after revision surgery with cochlear implant only. Results: During the study period, 877 cochlear implantations were performed. Our reimplantation rate for failure of the device is 5.7% (50 of 877). The main reasons for hard failure were loss of hermeticity and cracked casing following head trauma. Surgical difficulties might be due to neo-osteogenesis related to the use of bone dust. Initial atraumatic insertion is important to ensure that revision surgeries are less problematic. In postmeningitis deafness, initial choice of electrode array is of utmost importance. We would suggest a plain shape and a larger diameter array, to ensure sufficient subsequent insertion. Post-reimplantation audiologic results were the same or better than preoperative levels in 86% of cases. Conclusion: Failure might be difficult to diagnose in children with limited language skills. The surgical team and patients should be aware of the surgical difficulties that can be encountered, especially in cases of meningitis or initial traumatic insertion. Auditory performances after reimplantation are the same or better in most cases. © The Author(s) 2014.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the nonsurgical treatment of choice for children with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, CPAP limitations include difficulty with adherence and midface hypoplasia risk. We, therefore, sought to assess the effect of warm humidified air delivered via open nasal cannula (HFNC) on OSA in children in the sleep laboratory and at home. Methods: A retrospective review was performed among children recommended treatment of OSA with HFNC. Reasons for HFNC recommendation included poor surgical candidacy, residual OSA following surgery, and CPAP intolerance. Children underwent both diagnostic and HFNC titration sleep studies and were prescribed HFNC for home use. Standard sleep architecture, arousals, and apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) were assessed with the evaluation of reported adherence and complications over 12 months of treatment. Results: Twenty-two children (average 12.8 months, 95% confidence interval [95% CI: 7.0, 18.6]) with OSA (obstructive AHI [OAHI] range: 4.8-89.2 events/h) underwent HFNC titration with significant reduction in OAHI (28.9 events/h [17.6, 40.2] vs 2.6 [1.1, 4.0]; P <.001) (mean [95% CI]). Nineteen patients received home HFNC treatment. By 12 months, four patients were lost to follow-up and OSA resolved in three patients (16%). Of 12 remaining patients, 7 (58%) continued therapy while 5 (42%) discontinued due to intolerance. The most common treatment complication was cannula dislodgement. Additional complications included skin irritation, dry mucus membranes, restlessness, oxygen desaturation, and increased central apneas. Conclusion: HFNC offers a treatment alternative to CPAP in infants and young children with OSA and was well tolerated at home in our study. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Two experiments were conducted to assess the effects of dietary supplementation of acidifier on growthperformance, caecum microflora and nutrient and energy digestibility of broilers. In Experiment 1, 840 1-d-old maleArbor Acres broilers were randomly distributed into 7 dietary treatments with 12 replicates: 1) T1, Negative, controldiet without acidifier or antibiotics; 2) T2, Positive, Negative + antibiotics; 3) T3, Positive + 1 kg/tons acidifier; 4) T4,Positive + 2 kg/tons acidifier; 5) T5, Negative + 1 kg/tons acidifier; 6) T6, Negative + 2 kg/tons acidifier; 7) T7,Negative + 3 kg/tons acidifier.Addition of acidifier linearly increased (P=0.030) ADG and decreased (P=0.015) FCR in diets without antibiotics inthe starter phase and linearly reduced (P=0.041) FCR in the grower phase. Supplementation of acidifier decreased(P=0.014) the number of Clostridium perfringens and increased (P=0.007) the number of Lactobacillus in the caecum.The number of Lactobacillus was linearly (P< 0.001) and quadratically (P< 0.001) increased as the concentration ofacidifier increased.In Experiment 2, 216 21-d-old male Arbor Acres broilers were randomly distributed into 7 dietary treatments with 9replicates. Endogenous losses were obtained from another 27 broilers. Supplementation of acidifier Pro GIT SF3increased (P< 0.05) apparent digestibility of OM and CP. It also linearly increased (P< 0.05) apparent and totaldigestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and gross energy and increased (P< 0.05) the apparent andtrue metabolisable energy of the diet in the non-antibiotic diets.In conclusion, acidifier was effective in improving performance of broilers especially in diets without feedantibiotics. Acidifier also had beneficial effects on the composition of the microflora in the caecum and was aseffective as antibiotics in improving nutrient digestibility and energy value in broilers.

      " Abstract: The land-use/cover (LUC) change (LUCC) in small-scale basins can strongly impact regional environments and developments, and understanding the spatio-temporal characteristics of LUCC is important for sustainable development planning. This study explored the spatio-temporal characteristics of China’s Fuxian Lake Basin in 2017–2067, which may provide decision-making support for ecological and environmental protection measures. Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI images combined with a cellular automata–Markov model were used to simulate and forecast LUCC, and expand analysis and reduce analysis methods were applied to explore the spatio-temporal patterns of LUCC in this basin. The results showed that in 2017–2067: (1) arable land, forestland and water would be expected to expand; (2) garden, grassland, building region, road, structure, artificial piling and digging land, and desert and bare surface would contract; (3) the rate of arable land expansion in 2032–2037 and the rate of grassland loss in 2057–2062 would be the largest changes, reaching 1.670 and 0.856 km2/year, respectively and (4) the expansion and contraction of different LUCC classes were closely related to the “Four Retire Three Return” policy implemented by the local government. Therefore, the protection measures for environment should be set in advance according to the forecasting results of this study. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

      " Abstract: Purpose Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition in Acre, Brazil (MINA-Brazil) is a longitudinal, prospective population-based birth cohort, set-up to understand the effects of early environmental exposures and maternal lifestyle choices on growth and development of the Amazonian children. Participants Mother-baby pairs (n=1246) were enrolled at delivery from July 2015 to June 2016 in Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, Brazil. Mothers of 43.7% of the cohort were recruited in the study during pregnancy from February 2015 to January 2016. Study visits took place during pregnancy, delivery, at 1 month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after delivery. In addition to clinical and epidemiological data, samples collected by the MINA-Brazil study include plasma, serum and extracted DNA from blood and faeces, which are stored in a biobank. Findings to date Key baseline reports found a high prevalence of gestational night blindness (11.5%; 95% CI 9.97% to 13.25%) and maternal anaemia (39.4%; 95% CI 36.84% to 41.95%) at delivery. Antenatal malaria episodes (74.6% of Plasmodium vivax) were diagnosed in 8.0% of the women and were associated with an average reduction in birth weight z-scores of 0.35 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.57) and in birth length z-scores of 0.31 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.54), compared with malaria-free pregnancies. At 2-year follow-up, data collection strategies combined telephone calls, WhatsApp, social media community and home visits to minimise losses of follow-up (retention rate of 79.5%). Future plans A 5-year follow-up visit is planned in 2021 with similar interviews and biospecimens collection. The findings from this prospective cohort will provide novel insights into the roles of prenatal and postnatal factors in determining early childhood development in an Amazonian population. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

      " Abstract: As an effective tool for three-way decisions (3WD) problems, decision-theoretic rough sets (DTRSs) have raised increasing attention recently. In view of the advantages of q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic variables (q-ROULVs) in depicting uncertain information, a new DTRSs model based on q-ROULVs is proposed to solve three-way group decision-making (3WGDM) problems. Firstly, the loss function of DTRSs is depicted by q-ROULVs and a q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic DTRSs model is constructed subsequently. Secondly, to aggregate different experts' evaluation results on loss function in group decision-making (GDM) scenario, the q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic geometric Heronian mean (q-ROULGHM) operator and the q-rung orthopair uncertain linguistic weighted geometric Heronian mean (q-ROULWGHM) operator are presented. Related properties of the proposed operators are investigated. Thirdly, to compare the expected loss of each alternative, a new score function of q-ROULVs is defined and the corresponding decision rules for 3WGDM are deduced. Finally, an illustrative example of venture capital in high-tech projects is provided to verify the rationality and effectiveness of our method.

      " Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between psychopathy and its underlying traits and financial risk and time preferences. Design/methodology/approach: The authors measure risk and time preferences using both the cumulative prospect theory and quasi-hyperbolic time discounting in a sample of business majors. The Psychopathic Personality Inventory – Revised test is then used to measure the global psychopathy and eight primary and two secondary traits of the sample of business majors. The measures of psychopathy are used as explanatory variables to model variation in subjects’ time and risk preferences. Findings: The authors find that the overall score on the continuum of psychopathy is positively related to the linearity of the cumulative prospective utility function. A breakdown of psychopathy into its secondary and primary traits shows a more complex relation. For example, the secondary trait of self-centered impulsivity is statistically significant in models of financial risk preference determinants under the cumulative prospect theory. The authors find that the primary traits of self-centered impulsivity and stress immunity are related to a higher time preference discount rate under quasi-hyperbolic time preferences.

      " Abstract: Background: Reduction in length of stay has several advantages, including healthcare costs, patient choice, and minimizing hospital acquired infections. Additionally, length of stay is a surrogate marker of rate of recovery from the physiological insult of anaesthesia and surgery and complications thereof. A well-documented short-term benefit of laparoscopic compared to open colorectal resection is reduced length of stay. Methods: This was a review of prospectively collected data on all laparoscopic colorectal resections performed in our unit. We analyzed patients having primary colorectal anastomosis, to assess the effect of conversion compared to completion laparoscopically. Furthermore we compared those with or without diverting stoma, for the effect of stoma formation on postoperative length of stay (LOS). Results: Two hundred and thirteen patients had a colorectal resection. Of these 133 (62%) were left-sided or rectal resections. Resection with primary colorectal anastomosis was undertaken in 112 patients. A defunctioning stoma was performed in 13/112 (12%), and 32/112 (29%) were converted as the procedure could not be completed laparoscopically. Conversion was not significantly associated with increased LOS with weighted median of 6.5 and 6 days for conversion and no conversion, respectively. However, stoma formation significantly increased LOS to a median of 10 days compared with a median of 6 days in patients without a stoma (p = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U). Conclusions: The need for conversion, if performed in a timely and appropriate manner, has little impact on patient outcome compared to those completed laparoscopically, with no significant increase in LOS in our experience. In contrast, a diverting stoma does prolong LOS and some of the benefits of laparoscopic surgery may be lost unless patients requiring a stoma are identified preoperatively and have intensive pre- and postoperative stoma training. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose. The purpose of the article is to develop the theoretical and methodological foundations for the study of return migration policy based on its information support, including regression analysis and authors’ sociological research on return intentions of Ukrainian migrants. Methodology / approach. The mathematical tools were used for the assessment of Ukraine’s economical losses, related to migration. With the help of the sociological method (survey) migrants’ intentions and main motives to return were investigated. Stepwise regression model was built for identification of main factors of Ukrainian population’s international migration. Besides, general scientific methods were used in the study, such as: analysis, generalization, systematization, tabular and graphical. Results. Analysis showed the lack of statistical and sociological information on international migration (particularly return migration) of Ukrainian population. It substantiates the need for improving the system of information provision of migration policy. The results of the survey of the migrants from the Carpathian region of Ukraine (conducted in 2020) show low level of their readiness to return. According to the answers to the questionnaire, there are two main circumstances that could motivate migrants to return: high level of wages and general improving of economic situation in Ukraine. Due to the regression model it was found that the emigration of the population is influenced by the following factors: average monthly wages, gross regional product per capita, foreign direct investment per economically active person and the share of the population with incomes below the subsistence level. The article provides main benefits and ways of implementation of the return migration policy. Particularly, circular migration is considered as a good way to slow down losses of human resources. It is beneficial for all institutional units of the migration process. Originality / scientific novelty. The methodology for the consequences of international migration study is improved. In particular, the formula for determination of migration losses through the calculation of economic activity losses is proposed and calculated for the first time. The theoretical foundation of return migration policy is developed. In particular, the model of return migration process on the individual level is elaborated. The sociological tool for the return migration investigation is developed and tested. Practical value / implications. The practical recommendations for the human resources conservation are worked out. The questions for the survey, developed by the authors, could be used in further investigations in this issue. The model of return migration process is useful for developing a comprehensive return migration policy, which could support migrants at all stages of this process: decisions making, movement and reintegration. © 2022, Institute of Eastern European Research and Consulting.

      " Abstract: Previous studies suggest the physical structure of a habitat has profound effects on intraspecific competition and spacing behaviour among small mammals. We compared habitat preferences and the exploratory behaviour and aggressive territorial defence of male house mice in three types of enclosure differing only in their degree of structural complexity. Each enclosure contained a nestbox placed in one corner, a central food hopper and 10 house bricks. The bricks were either placed around the outer walls (open enclosures), lined up across the middle (wall enclosures) or scattered separately across the floor (complex enclosures). In pairwise choice tests, mice showed a strong preference for wall or complex enclosures over open enclosures but no preference between wall and complex enclosures. They were more active throughout the enclosure with complex structuring and stayed near the side walls in open enclosures. Residents in open enclosures initially showed a lower rate of attack and duration of pursuit when faced with an intruder but not when faced with a second intruder. In complex enclosures, nearly all encounters ended because the residents continued pursuit but lost track of the intruder. This occurred in only half of intruder pursuits in open and wall enclosures. Our results suggest that mice prefer areas containing physical structure because this provides a degree of protection from predators but territories with complex physical structuring appear to be much more difficult to defend. Complex areas may thus support a higher density of mice than open areas or those with more simply aligned physical structuring. © 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: Misfit in the conical implant-abutment interface plays an important role on the mechanical behavior of the implant when masticatory forces are applied. The origin of the misfit adopted in this work is a conical angle difference between implant and abutment, which can be due to a combination of design decisions and manufacturing tolerances. The goal of this work was to investigate the effects of the implant-abutment conical angle difference in the following mechanical features: interfacial microgap, preload loss on the bolt, stress level in the bone, and abutment removal force and/or torque. Materials and Methods: A simplified three-dimensional nonlinear monoparametric finite element model of an OsseoSpeed TX 4.5 S 9-mm implant (Astra Tech) with a tapered implant-abutment interface was built to evaluate the variability of the mechanical features cited above with the conical angle difference, keeping constant the overall geometry, load and boundary conditions, material properties, frictional behavior, and mesh structure. Results: As the conical angle difference increased, the following effects were observed: the microgap decreased and remained almost constant for values over a given positive angle difference, the stress level in the bone increased sensitively, the removal force and/or torque needed to separate the abutment from the implant varied slightly, and the bolt preload loss increased. Conclusions: In light of the results provided, the conical angle difference in the implant-abutment interface had a significant influence on the overall mechanical behavior of the implant. Among the four mechanical features considered, the interfacial microgap and the bone stress were demonstrated to be the most sensitive to the conical angle difference, and therefore the most relevant when selecting an optimum value in the design process of a conical interface. © 2013 by Quintessence Publishing Co Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Subregions of the frontal cortex including the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) are implicated in rule learning, although changes in structural connectivity underlying rule learning are poorly understood. We imaged OFC axonal projections to dmPFC during training in a multiple choice foraging task and used a reinforcement learning model to quantify explore-exploit strategy use and prediction error magnitude. Here we show that rule training, but not experience of reward alone, enhances OFC bouton plasticity. Baseline bouton density and gains during training correlate with rule exploitation, while bouton loss correlates with exploration and scales with the magnitude of experienced prediction errors. We conclude that rule learning sculpts frontal cortex interconnectivity and adjusts a thermostat for the explore-exploit balance.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: High temperature superconducting (HTS) generators are being considered for large offshore direct-drive (DD) wind turbines as they are expected to be lightweight and compact. However, short circuit torques of an HTS generator with integral-slot distributed windings (ISDWs) are too high for wind turbine constructions, mainly due to the large magnetic air gap. Fractional-slot concentrated windings (FSCWs) can be considered to address this issue since their high leakage inductance can limit short circuit currents and torques. Unlike ISDWs, FSCWs produce great contents of space harmonics that induce excessive losses in rotor components. Multi-layer and stator-shifting windings have been proposed to effectively reduce such losses. Based on a conventional 12-slot 10-pole configuration, this paper evaluates the effects of multi-layer and stator-shifting FSCWs on torque production and loss reduction in a 10 MW DD HTS generator. The examined losses include eddy current losses in the rotor shields and AC losses in the HTS field winding. This paper also checks if these FSCW schemes maintain the advantage of achieving a low short circuit torque. The results show that a 6-phase stator-shifting winding is the best choice for applying FSCWs to HTS generators. © 2002-2011 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: High-alcohol-drinking rats, given access to 10% ethanol, expressed an alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) only after multiple deprivations. In alcohol-preferring (P) rats, concurrent access to multiple ethanol concentrations combined with repeated cycles of EtOH access and deprivation produced excessive ethanol drinking. The current study was undertaken to examine the effects of repeated alcohol deprivations with concurrent access to multiple concentrations of ethanol on ethanol intake of HAD replicate lines of rats. HAD-1 and HAD-2 rats received access to 10, 20 and 30% (v/v) ethanol for 6 weeks. Rats from each replicate line were assigned to: (1) a non-deprived group; (2) a group initially deprived of ethanol for 2 weeks; or (3) a group initially deprived for 8 weeks. Following the restoration of the ethanol solutions, cycle of 2 weeks of ethanol exposure and 2 weeks of alcohol deprivation was repeated three times for a total of four deprivations. Following the initial ethanol deprivation period, deprived groups significantly increased ethanol intakes during the initial 24-hour re-exposure period. Multiple deprivations increased ethanol intakes, shifted preference to higher ethanol concentrations and prolonged the duration of the elevated ethanol intakes for up to 5 days. In addition, repeated deprivations increased ethanol intake in the first 2-hour re-exposure period as high as 5-7 g/kg (which are equivalent to amounts consumed in 24 hours by HAD rats), and produced blood ethanol levels in excess of 150 mg%. The results indicate that HAD rats exhibit 'loss-of-control' of alcohol drinking with repeated deprivations when multiple ethanol concentrations are available. © 2008 The Authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper reports an experiment examining the effect of age and protein supplementation on growth and fertility of Shorthorn-Devon cross heifers grazing natural pastures in the summer rainfall, subtropical environment of the Upper Clarence valley, north-eastern New South Wales. Heifers born over the period October to January 1963-64 were weaned in June 1964 and allotted at random within age groups (by month of birth) to a supplemented or non-supplemented treatment. The supplemented heifers were given linseed meal during the dry winter period each year from 1964 to 1966 inclusive (May-June to September-October). They were weighed each month and joined with bulls in the early summer of 1965 (2 years) and 1966 (3 years). They were examined for pregnancy in the autumn, and their calves were identified at birth. Supplemented heifers gained weight throughout and non-supplemented heifers generally lost weight in the winter periods. At two years fertility was closely related to liveweight at joining in supplemented heifers, but not in others. Heifers born in January gave the poorest reproductive performance, as the two supplemented ones that became pregnant in 1965 died at calving, and two-thirds of the non-supplemented ones were still empty after joining as 3-year-olds. The advantage of high 2-year-old fertility gained by heifers born in October and November, due to their greater size at joining, was partly offset by low fertility when lactating the following year. It is concluded that a decision as to whether a heifer should be supplemented during a period of nutritional stress prior to joining ought to be based on the probability of her reaching a prescribed target weight at joining as a result of receiving the supplement. The target weight for lactating heifers was at least 100 Ib higher than for dry hdfers. The results also indicate specific areas for further research. © 1968, CSIRO.

      " Abstract: Purpose. Cortical visual impairment (CVI) is a leading cause of bilateral vision impairment. Because many patients with CVI cannot perform an optotype test, their acuity is often measured with a grating stimulus using a preferential looking (PL) test or the visual-evoked potential (VEP) recording. The purpose of this study is to determine the relationship among VEP vernier acuity, VEP grating acuity, and behavioral grating acuity in patients with CVI. Methods. Sweep VEP vernier acuity, sweep VEP grating acuity, and behavioral grating acuity (measured with PL cards) were measured in 29 patients with CVI. The patients ranged in age from 3.2 to 22.7 years (mean: 12.3; SD: 5.3). Because the measures of vernier acuity and grating acuity have different units, the results were expressed as the log deficit (with normal being 30 cycles per degrees and 0.5 arc min, respectively). Results. VEP grating acuity loss and VEP vernier acuity loss were significantly related (r = 0.70) with a slope of 1.31, indicating that indicating that on average, vernier acuity showed a 0.2 log unit deficit compared with VEP grating acuity. Behavioral grating acuity loss and VEP grating acuity loss were also significantly related (r = 0.64) with a slope of 1.55, indicating that behavioral acuity was more reduced (by ∼0.3 log unit). VEP vernier acuity loss and behavioral grating acuity loss were significantly related (r = 0.66) with a slope of 0.85, indicating that behavioral acuity and VEP vernier acuity showed a similar magnitude of reduction. A Bland-Altman comparison between the VEP vernier acuity method and the behavioral acuity method showed a flat slope (0.30), indicating that the two measures produce similar visual acuity measures across the range of acuity levels. Conclusions. In patients with CVI, VEP vernier acuity showed greater deficits than VEP grating acuity and was more similar to the behavioral measures of grating acuity. © 2009 American Academy of Optometry.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This article presents a compact precision free-space microwave measurement setup with a choice of three dielectric lenses to tailor the antenna focal plane characteristics for extracting complex dielectric permittivity of small samples. Custom designed spot-focusing horn antenna pairs were used to achieve a compact setup with antenna separation distance, 2f l : 4λ c-8λ c and focal spot size, fs : 1λ c-1.5λ c , where λ c is the wavelength at center frequency. Using the compact free-space setup, relative complex permittivity (j) was extracted over 8-12 GHz for low-and high-loss dielectrics with lateral dimensions, 3.3 λ c× 3.3λ c and 10 λ c × 10 λ c. For large materials under test (MUTs), i.e., 10 λ c × 10 λ c , measurement accuracy in dielectric constant, Δ% was <0.65% and ≤1.14% for low-and high-loss dielectrics, respectively. For smaller MUTs ( 3.3 λ c × 3.3 λ c ), Δ % was <0.89% and ≤2.29% for low-and high-loss MUTs, respectively. The error in loss tangent ( Δ) varied over 0.002-0.016 and 0.015-0.056 for large ( 10 λ c × 10 λ c ) and small MUTs ( 3.3 λ c × 3.3 λ c ), respectively. For large MUTs, biconvex lens pair with the smallest f-s ( 1 λ c ) and f-l ( 4 λ c ) among the three lenses yielded the best accuracy in dielectric constant due to tight field focusing at the focal plane. The plano-convex lens pair yielded the best accuracy in loss tangent for large MUTs due to slow variation in the phase of the local plane wave. By tailoring antenna focal plane characteristics, a compact free-space setup that is 6×-10× smaller than the classical setup for handling MUTs that are 1/5th of the size used in classical setup is demonstrated without compromising the measurement accuracy.  © 1963-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In optimizing passively Q-switched lasers, there is a unique choice of output coupler and unsaturated absorber transmission which maximizes the laser output energy and efficiency for each three-way combination of laser gain medium, absorber medium, and pump intensity (i.e., inversion density). In the present paper, we generalize and solve the three coupled differential equations which describe the passively Q-switched laser to obtain closed form solutions for key laser parameters such as the output energy and pulsewidth. We then apply the Lagrange multiplier technique to determine the optimum mirror reflectivities and unsaturated absorber transmissions as a function of two dimensionless variables. The first variable, z, corresponds to the ratio of the logarithmic round-trip small signal gain to the round-trip dissipative (nonuseful) optical loss and is identical to that which was used in previous treatments to optimize the rapidly Q-switched laser. The second variable, α, is unique to the passively Q-switched laser and is equal to the saturation energy density of the amplifying medium divided by the saturation energy density of the absorber. It is largely determined by the ration of the absorber to stimulated emission cross sections, but also depends on the speed of relaxation mechanisms in the amplifying and absorbing media relative to the resonator photon decay time. Several design curves, valid for all four level amplifying and absorbing media, are then generated. These permit the design of an optimum passively Q-switched laser and an estimate of its key performance parameters to be obtained quickly with the aid of a simple hand calculator. In the limit of large α (>10), the design curves are virtually indistinguishable from the rapidly Q-switched case. The curves can also be used to perform rapid tradeoff studies of different absorbing materials. The theory can also be applied to CW-pumped, repetitively Q-switched systems through a simple multiplicative factor for the laser gain. The theory is applied to the analysis of a passively Q-switched Nd: YAG laser previously reported in the literature and shown to give excellent agreement with the experimental results. © 1995, IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Great crested newts Triturus cristatus are a European protected species whose conservation depends on the provision and protection of their breeding habitat. The species is in decline internationally, partly due to loss of suitable breeding habitat (European Environment Agency, 2019). A habitat suitability index (HSI) developed in 2000 is extensively used in great crested newt conservation to assess breeding habitat quality in the UK. Here, we introduce a new HSI with an improved ability to reflect T. cristatus presence/absence in UK ponds. This proposed HSI is easier to use, requires less data and predicts T. cristatus presence/absence better than the previous index. To inform the new index, we used a dual approach to identify the relative importance of environmental criteria to predict T. cristatus presence/absence. Firstly, we conducted a survey of 288 HSI users to assess the perceived strengths and limitations of the existing index. Secondly, we analysed national datasets of T. cristatus presence/absence and associated environmental data. Using these findings, we then tested various index modifications. The final modifications of the new HSI include (i) using an arithmetic (instead of geometric) mean, to reduce calculation errors and allow compensation between variables; (ii) excluding water quality and waterfowl impact, as these lacked significant power to predict T. cristatus presence/absence and were deemed inaccurate by HSI users; and (iii) changing the scoring relationship for pond area to better reflect current data and provide scores for ponds over 2000m2. We compared scores from the new and original HSIs using an independent dataset for validation, showing that the new HSI better reflects T. cristatus presence/absence (larger effect sizes and R-squared values) in comparison to the old HSI. Adopting this improved HSI will enable more effective conservation of the protected species via better-informed decision-making and monitoring. © 2024, British Herpetological Society.

      " Abstract: Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected access to health and social services globally, leading to delays in accessing appropriate care. However, while there is a growing base of research into service access for the general population, there remains scarce information on the implications of the pandemic on disabled people. This article describes issues with health and disability support access for people with impaired vision in Aotearoa New Zealand (Aotearoa). Methods: Applying an Interpretive Description methodology, 62 interviews were conducted with disabled people; 10 of these individuals identified as having impaired vision. Findings were analyzed thematically for the entire group of 62, representing varied impairment groups, and then for the 10 who had impaired vision. Results: Five key themes arose from the interviews, including transportation difficulties, mental distress, loss of community, loss of physical contact and signals, and general loss of support. Participants identified that this loss of support occurred at multiple levels, meaning that the disability and healthcare system as a whole was ill-equipped to manage their needs. Participants reported a lag-time in accessing care, meaning that the effects of the pandemic are still felt due to a lack of available support and resources. Discussion: This article remains one of a few studies to look at the implications of the pandemic on access to health and disability services for those with impaired vision. It highlights that despite Aotearoa's good track record in managing the pandemic, groups were forgotten and marginalized by the collective response to managing COVID-19. Implications for Practitioners: Blindness professionals must be aware of the possible disadvantages and impacts of pandemics and other disasters on people with impaired vision and their access to health and disability services.

      " Abstract: The combination of spatial structure and non-linear population dynamics can promote the persistence of coupled populations, even when the average population growth rate of the patches seen in isolation would predict otherwise. This phenomenon has generally been conceptualized and investigated through the movement of individuals among patches that each holds many individuals, as in metapopulation models. However, population persistence can likewise increase as the result of individuals moving among sites (e.g. breeding territories) within in a single patch. Here I examine the latter: individuals making small-scale informed decisions with respect to where to breed can promote population persistence in poor environments. Based on a simple algebraic model, I demonstrate information thresholds, and predict that greater information use is required for population persistence under lower spatial heterogeneity in habitat quality, all else equal. Second, I implement an individual-based model to explore prior experience and prospecting on conspecific success within a more complex, and spatially heterogeneous environment. Uniquely, I jointly examine the effects of simulated habitat loss, spatial heterogeneity prior to habitat, and variation in information gathering on population persistence. I find that habitat loss accelerates population quasi-extinction risk; however, information use reduces extinction probabilities in proportion to the level of information gathering. Per capita reproductive success declines with number of breeding sites, suggesting that information-mediated Allee effects may contribute to extinction risk. In conclusion, my study suggests that populations in a changing world may be increasingly vulnerable to extinction where patch size and spatial heterogeneity constrain the effectiveness of information-use strategies. © 2016 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Trajectory prediction is imperative in the operation of autonomous vehicles because it aids in understanding the surrounding environment through perception fusion of multiple sensors and high-accuracy localisation. Furthermore, the output of algorithms used for trajectory prediction is used in decision making and path planning. However, the accuracy of trajectory prediction is dependent on the perception system particularly when low-cost sensors are used or severe weather conditions are encountered. Data-dependent and task-dependent aleatoric uncertainty affects the trajectory prediction task. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a network for trajectory prediction that integrates the temporal pattern attention and the graph convolutional sequence encoding to address the data-dependent uncertainty caused by observation noise and machine-perceptual errors. Furthermore, an adaptive weight loss function was developed to address the training difficulties caused by loss-dominated tasks (task-dependent aleatoric uncertainty) in a trajectory prediction network. The results of our experiment indicate a 20% improvement in predictive performance over existing methods under a 5-s prediction horizon. Furthermore, an experiment comparing robustness to heteroscedastic uncertainty confirmed that the proposed method improves trajectory prediction robustness against observation noise and perceptual errors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study focuses on the construction of a questionnaire for measuring metacognitive knowledge, metacognitive regulation and metacognitive responsiveness among students in higher education and the subsequent process of testing to determine its validity.PurposeThe aim of the study was to construct an original instrument for measuring features of metacognition, henceforth referred to as the Awareness of Independent Learning Inventory (AILI), and further to establish the similarities and differences between this model and existing instruments for measuring metacognition.SampleThe AILI questionnaire was distributed to 1058 students in various types of Teacher Training Institutes in the Netherlands and Belgium. The abridged English version of the questionnaire was administered to another sample of 729 students reading Economics and Business Administration at the University of Maastricht in the south of the Netherlands.Design and methodsThe AILI instrument was constructed on the basis of a facet design along two dimensions: components of metacognition and topics of concern to students in higher education. The data gathered with the instrument was analyzed by means of a generalisability study and a decision study, respectively. The validity of the instrument was investigated by using confirmatory factor analysis.ResultsThe generalisability study showed that the reliability of the instrument was satisfactory. The decision study revealed that the number of items included in the questionnaire could be reduced substantially by leaving out two components of one of the dimensions in the facet design, without losing too much generalisability. The validity study showed that there was a considerable level of congruity between parts of the AILI questionnaire and the relevant parts of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ).ConclusionsThe AILI questionnaire is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring metacognitive knowledge, regulation and responsiveness.

A management challenge arises not only because of the lack of understanding of soil erosion processes and lack of data, but also due to difficulties in the application of soil erosion model. The objectives here are to measure erosion rates and sediment yields in a watershed in West Java using the Agricultural Non-point Source Pollution (AGNPS) model, to document rates of erosion from forestry and agroforestry land uses in the basin, and to compare soil erosion rates calculated by the AGNPS and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) model. The method was to use both primary and secondary data as inputs to the AGNPS and USLE models, as well as field observations to compare the outputs from the two model with conditions in the field. The AGNPS model measured about half of the erosion rate predicted by the USLE. However the AGNPS output appears to be more realistic. The erosion rates of the study area (2592 ha; 6.402 acres) were 95 and 103 ton/acre/yr (8,480 and 9,205 ton/acre/yr) in 1991 and 1992. The sediment yields were 99,630 ha/year (246,000 ton/yr) in 1991, and 108,135 ha (267,000 ton/yr) in 1992. The t-test regarding soil erosion in forested and agroforestry areas demonstrates that the difference in soil erosion rates is not statistically significant (α =0.05).

Prospect theory predicts that when individuals must choose between such alternatives, they will either (a) be biased toward the risk-free alternative in a gain frame (i.e., when they perceive both prospects as gains), or (b) be biased toward the risky alternative in a loss frame. The decision of the plaintiff to either continue negotiations or go to trial is typically done in a gain frame; the defendant has to choose between losses. Thus, it was hypothesized that plaintiffs are risk aversive and defendants risk seeking in negotiations. Alternatively, it was hypothesized that parties who expect to prevail at trial are risk aversive, and parties who expect to lose are risk seeking. In four experiments, with both laymen and law students as subjects, the first hypothesis received some support, and the second hypothesis was strongly supported. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.\u001b[0m :\n",

Best practice guidelines recommend the use of exercise to slow the rate of bone loss, to maintain muscle strength and physical function, and to prevent falls and further fractures. However, treatment effects are often small and difficult to sustain and adherence, or the extent to which patients engage in treatment, has been identified as an important issue by many studies. Our hypothesis is that integrating adherence intervention strategies with an exercise intervention will be beneficial. We will compare physiotherapy exercise rehabilitation with adherence support versus physiotherapy exercise rehabilitation alone in terms of effects on (A) physical function, quality of life and fear of falling and (B) exercise self-efficacy and adherence.

      " Abstract: This study uses a stated choice experiment and drawings of four different type-environments to assess how various security-promoting factors in the built physical environment influence valuation of walking time when accessing public transport. Valuations that can be applied for evaluating policies to improve perceived security are obtained. Consistent results are achieved, indicating that the method is promising for incorporating aspects in the physical environment in the welfare analysis. The results indicate a systematic variation in value of walk time in different physical environments and it is more dependent of the physical environment for women than for men. This paper thereby contributes to the literature by showing that results by social sciences can be verified using methods and theories traditionally used in transport and welfare analysis and may therefore be incorporated in standard CBA. A contribution of this study is the insight that the perception of insecurity involved in accessing the public transport system is a welfare loss that can be quantified. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aim To determine the outcomes of Aurolab aqueous drainage implant (AADI) placed in the superotemporal versus the inferonasal quadrant in adult eyes with refractory glaucoma. Methods This was a retrospective study of eyes that had AADI placement and completed a minimum of 2-year follow-up. The choice of the quadrant was at the surgeon's discretion and mainly depended on the amount of scarring and conjunctival mobility. The cumulative failure rate of the AADI was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) >21 mm Hg or not reduced by 20% below baseline on two consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months, IOP ≤5 mm Hg on two consecutive follow-up visits after 3 months, reoperation for glaucoma or a complication, or loss of light perception vision. Results We included 84 eyes with AADI in the inferonasal quadrant versus 69 eyes in the superotemporal quadrant. A significant drop in IOP was seen in both groups (18.4±10.4 mm Hg in the inferonasal group vs 17.7±11.1 mm Hg in the superotemporal group; p=0.63) at 3-month follow-up and this was maintained until last follow-up. Best-corrected visual acuity, IOP, number of IOP-lowering medications and complications were similar between the two groups at all time points. The cumulative success rate at 2-year follow-up without IOP-lowering medications was 57.1% (47.1%-68.1%) in the inferonasal group and 50.7% (39.8%-63.1%) in the superotemporal group (p=0.47). Conclusions Inferonasal AADI placement appears to be an equally safe and effective surgical option compared with superotemporal AADI placement and may be helpful in certain clinical situations. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

      " Abstract: Water scarcity and carbon emissions are two of the most pressing issues facing the world. Water rights trading (WRT) and carbon emissions trading (CET) can alleviate pressure on resources and the environment and promote sustainable development. However, the relationship between water scarcity and carbon emissions results in a complex water-carbon nexus between sectors. To explore the mechanisms of interaction among related sectors in the context of WRT and CET, this study built a tripartite evolutionary game model that includes the agriculture, industry, and forestry sectors (AIFSs) to simulate the strategic evolution process and interactions between stakeholders based on replicated dynamic equations. Four cities in the Dongjiang River Basin (DRB) in southern China were analyzed to quantify the influence of key parameters on the strategic evolution process and reveal the relationship between sectors under the effect of WRT and CET. The results indicated that There is a significant impact of agricultural net benefits in the DRB on the choice of AIFS strategy, which in turn leads to better WRT that promotes the mutual coupling of AIFS strategies. In addition, strategy coupling brings higher relative returns and risks to the game system, and multiple markets enable AIFS to hedge losses that may result from single market failures in the mutual game. Furthermore, AIFS' behavioral strategies are not necessarily aligned with market expectations, which has implications for us as we guide the development of WRT and CET. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The inverted pendulum is a popular model for describing bipedal dynamic walking. The operating point of the walker can be specified by the combination of initial mid-stance velocity (v 0) and step angle () chosen for a given walk. In this paper, using basic mechanics, a framework of physical constraints that limit the choice of operating points is proposed. The constraint lines thus obtained delimit the allowable region of operation of the walker in the v 0- plane. A given average forward velocity can be achieved by several combinations of v 0 and . Only one of these combinations results in the minimum mechanical power consumption and can be considered the optimum operating point for the given . This paper proposes a method for obtaining this optimal operating point based on tangency of the power and velocity contours. Putting together all such operating points for various , a family of optimum operating points, called the optimal locus, is obtained. For the energy loss and internal energy models chosen, the optimal locus obtained has a largely constant step angle with increasing speed but tapers off at non-dimensional speeds close to unity. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Methods: one hundred patients undergoing LAR-TME with proximal diverting stoma were analysed between 2013 and 2016. Postoperative CRP and PCT levels were measured on the 3rd and 6th postoperative days. results: There were 11 clinical leaks with a negative impact in univariate analysis on AL of male gender, larger and stenotic tumours, intraoperative blood loss > 200 mL, need for perioperative blood transfusion, postoperative anaemia and operating time exceeding 180 minutes. Upon multivariate analysis, only perioperative blood transfusion was an independent AL risk factor. Recorded CRP was higher in AL patients when compared with non-AL cases on both the 3rd postoperative day (152.4 mg/L vs 93 mg/L, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the 6th postoperative day (130.5 mg/L vs 68.2 mg/L; P < 0.0001). PCT levels also significantly differed between AL and non-AL cases on the 3rd postoperative day (0.5 ng/mL vs 0.2 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001) and the 6th postoperative day (1.16 ng/mL vs 0.1 ng/mL, respectively; P < 0.0001). Both CRP and PCT showed high negative predictive values (NPV) for the diagnosis of AL on both postoperative days. conclusion: Following low restorative proctectomy, high NPV of CRP and PCT measurements for the diagnosis of anastomotic leaks may assist decision-making for early hospital discharge.

Rats were tested after 6-hydroxydopamine or vehicle infusions into the ACC in a T maze cost-benefit task in which the rats could choose either to climb a barrier to obtain a high reward in one arm or run into the other arm without a barrier to obtain a low reward. Results demonstrate that infusions of 6-hydroxydopamine induced a near total loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive fibers in the ACC. Unlike sham-lesioned rats, 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats exhibited a reduced preference for the high-cost-high-reward response option when given the choice of obtaining a low reward with little effort.

      " Abstract: Given the growing severity of particulate matter (PM) and greenhouse gas pollution, the Korean government recently began supporting the use of eco-friendly vehicles, such as electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. However, the uptake of these vehicles has been slower than anticipated because of the high purchase price and lack of infrastructure. Therefore, the Korean government has eased restrictions on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) vehicles to encourage the vast majority of consumers to purchase LPG vehicles, expecting that they will serve as a stepping stone to switch from internal combustion engine vehicles to their eco-friendly counterparts. However, there have been only a few studies on consumer preferences for LPG vehicles in consideration of this amendment. To analyze consumer preferences for all fuel types, including LPG, this study used a discrete choice experiment combined with a reference-dependent model. The results showed a loss aversion tendency and asymmetric preferences among consumers with regard to vehicle choice. Based on these results, a simulation analysis was conducted to predict the future market share and PM pollution level. The findings indicated that the government's LPG vehicle deregulation policy could achieve positive PM reduction effects in the short term but none in the long term. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The presence of a predator can result in the alteration, loss or reversal of a mating preference. Under predation risk, females often change their initial preference for conspicuous males, favouring less flashy males to reduce the risk of being detected by predators. Previous studies on predator-induced plasticity in mate preferences have given females a choice between more and less conspicuous conspecific males. However, in species that naturally hybridize, it is also possible that females might choose an inconspicuous heterospecific male over a conspicuous conspecific male under predation risk. Our study addresses this question using the green swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri) and the southern platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), which are sympatric in the wild. We hypothesized that X. helleri females would prefer the sworded conspecific males in the absence of a predator but favour the less conspicuous, swordless, heterospecific males in the presence of a predator. Contrary to our expectation, females associated more with the heterospecific male than the conspecific male in the control (no predator) treatment, and they were non-choosy in the predator treatment. This might reflect that females were attracted to the novel male phenotype when there was no risk of predation but became more neophobic after predator exposure. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, our results suggest that predation pressure may affect female preferences for conspecific versus heterospecific males. We also found striking within-population, between-individual variation in behavioural plasticity: females differed in the strength and direction of their preferences, as well as in the extent to which they altered their preferences in response to changes in perceived predation risk. Such variation in female preferences for heterospecific males could potentially lead to temporal and spatial variation in hybridization rates in the wild. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Accurate short-term load forecasting is of great significance in improving the dispatching efficiency of power grids, ensuring the safe and reliable operation of power grids, and guiding power systems to formulate reasonable production plans and reduce waste of resources. However, the traditional short-term load forecasting method has limited nonlinear mapping ability and weak generalization ability to unknown data, and it is prone to the loss of time series information, further suggesting that its forecasting accuracy can still be improved. This study presents a short-term power load forecasting method based on Bagging- stochastic configuration networks (SCNs). First, the missing values in the original data are filled with the average values. Second, the influencing factors, such as the weather- and week-type data, are coded. Then, combined with the data of influencing factors after coding, the Bagging-SCNs integration algorithm is used to predict the short-term load. Finally, by taking the daily load data of Quanzhou City, Zhejiang Province as an example, the program of the abovementioned method is compiled in Python language and then compared with the long short-term memory neural network algorithm and the single-SCNs algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed method for medium- and short-term load forecasting has a high forecasting accuracy and a significant effect on improving the accuracy of load forecasting.  © 2024 Pang et al.

      " Abstract: Importance: Laryngomalacia, the most common congenital anomaly of the infant airway, can lead to poor feeding and failure to thrive. The decision to perform the standard surgical treatment, supraglottoplasty, is often based upon a sustained period of poor weight gain or weight loss. Objective: To characterize patterns of growth in infants with laryngomalacia, preceding and following supraglottoplasty. Design: Retrospective chart review. Bioinformatics techniques were used to procure data from a clinical data warehouse based on the HL7 Reference Information Model consisting of all infants who underwent supraglottoplasty from June 1, 2005 to October 31, 2013. Height and weight measurements were obtained from 76 operated patients allowing for characterization of growth changes from the time of surgery to an average of 9 months following surgery. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the following variables for correlations with changes in weight, height and body mass index percentiles: patient age at surgery, preoperative weight, gender, and ethnic background. Setting: Academic pediatric tertiary medical center. Participants: Patients under 2 years of age at the time of surgery, who underwent supraglottoplasty for laryngomalacia, with height and weight measurements recorded within 3 months preceding surgery and greater than 3 months following surgery. Intervention: Supraglottoplasty. Main outcomes and measures: Change in weight, height and body mass index (BMI) percentile from pre-op to post-op. Results: BMI increased from a mean of 15.4 to 18.0 and BMI percentile from a mean of 34 to 51 from pre-op to post-op. The largest BMI percentile increases were observed in infants that were 3 months or younger at the time of surgery, as well as in those under 12 months of age, who were in the lowest BMI quintile. Conclusions and relevance: Infants who underwent supraglottoplasty tended to be small in weight and stature, and gained weight after surgery. Most of the weight gain occurred within 6 months of surgery. The largest increases in BMI percentile were observed in infants who were younger and smaller at the time of surgery while the infants older than 18 months had no significant gain. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: Diagnosis and treatment of Ménière’s disease remains a significant challenge because of our inability to understand what is occurring on a molecular level. MicroRNA (miRNA) perilymph profiling is a safe methodology and may serve as a “liquid biopsy” equivalent. We used machine learning (ML) to evaluate miRNA expression profiles of various inner ear pathologies to predict diagnosis of Ménière’s disease. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary academic hospital. Subjects and Methods: Perilymph was collected during labyrinthectomy (Ménière’s disease, n = 5), stapedotomy (otosclerosis, n = 5), and cochlear implantation (sensorineural hearing loss [SNHL], n = 9). miRNA was isolated and analyzed with the Affymetrix miRNA 4.0 array. Various ML classification models were evaluated with an 80/20 train/test split and cross-validation. Permutation feature importance was performed to understand miRNAs that were critical to the classification models. Results: In terms of miRNA profiles for conductive hearing loss versus Ménière’s, 4 models were able to differentiate and identify the 2 disease classes with 100% accuracy. The top-performing models used the same miRNAs in their decision classification model but with different weighted values. All candidate models for SNHL versus Ménière’s performed significantly worse, with the best models achieving 66% accuracy. Ménière’s models showed unique features distinct from SNHL. Conclusions: We can use ML to build Ménière’s-specific prediction models using miRNA profile alone. However, ML models were less accurate in predicting SNHL from Ménière’s, likely from overlap of miRNA biomarkers. The power of this technique is that it identifies biomarkers without knowledge of the pathophysiology, potentially leading to identification of novel biomarkers and diagnostic tests. © American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2020.\u001b[0m :\n",

Expendability, cost, maintenance, availability of software, and performance characteristics are such problems considered by the decision. The precise estimation of the pertinent data is one of the vital phases in DM systems. This paper presents a fuzzy MCDM-based cluster head (CH) selection and hybrid routing protocol to solve the most common issues. In this research article, the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (GIFSS) approach is utilized to select the optimal CH, and hybrid shark smell optimization (SSO), and a genetic algorithm (GA) is introduced for the effective routing. Initially, the wireless sensor network (WSN) system and energy models are designed, and then the nodes are grouped into several clusters. Next, based on the GIFSS, the CH nodes are selected, and finally, an effective routing is placed based on the hybrid optimizations. The implementation is performed on the NS2 platform, and the performances are evaluated by packet delivery ratio (PDR), delay, packet loss ratio (PLR), network lifetime, bit error rate (BER), energy consumption, throughput, and jitter. The existing approaches named energy centers examining using particle swarm optimization (EC-PSO), variable dimension-based PSO (VD-PSO), energy-efficient PSO-based CH selection (PSO-ECHS), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-sugeno fuzzy (LEACH-SF), SSO, and GA are compared with the proposed strategy.

      " Abstract: Objective: To present our experience of soft tissue cover of lower one third of tibia and foot, treated by an Orthopaedic Surgeon without any special training and reliability of this flap. Patients and Methods: Eleven patients, ten males and one female, with soft tissue defect of lower one third tibia and foot requiring soft tissue cover were treated from March 1999 to February 2004. The flap was outlined at the posterior aspect of junction of upper and middle 1/3 leg. The pivot point of the pedicle was at least 5cm i.e., 3 fingers' breadth above the lateral mallelous to allow anastomosis with the peroneal artery. Skin incision was started along the line in which the fascial pedicle would be taken. The subdermal layer was dissected to expose the sural nerve, accompanying superficial sural vessels and short saphenous vein. The subcutaneous fascial pedicle was elevated, with a width of 2cm to include the nerve and these vessels. At the proximal margin of the flap, the nerve and the vessels were ligated and severed. The skin island was elevated with the deep fascia. The donor site defect was closed directly when the flap was less than 3cm wide. A larger donor site defect along with the pedicle was covered with a split thickness skin graft. Results: All flaps except one survived. Most flaps showed slight venous congestion which cleared in a few days. There was no loss of split skin graft. Conclusion: Distally based Sural artery flap remains the choice for reconstruction of soft tissue defects of lower 1/3 tibia and foot.

      " Abstract: In this essay I respond to Cristyn Davies and Kerry Robinson's research on queer families by remarking on the distance GLBTQI people have travelled in the last half century. I raise critical questions about the potential gains and possible losses that may result from bringing heretofore subjugated knowledges into the school curriculum. Drawing on my own biography, I also interrogate the radical edge that our outsider status once allowed us, the rapid normalization of gay life, and the foreclosure of options which that normalization has brought. Finally, I pose a distinction between nontraditional and queer families as a prompt to further investigation of how vectors of identity such as class, race, ethnicity, and religion intersect with the choices people make about constructing families and raising children.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper aims to study the vulnerability of the network to sequential cascading failures attacks where the attack strategy integrates network theory and discounted reward with Markov decision process (MDP) in the target selection process. A control strategy is designed to maximize the attack's long-term expected reward while reducing the attack sequence duration. The attack model identifies the most suitable targets by prediction through a Markov process for predicting the propagation and consequences of the failure. The state transition probabilities through a hidden failure model embedded in an independent edge-dependent network evolution model is estimated. Value iteration algorithms are used to identify targets at every attack stage. Target selection is updated depending on network changes. The results provide an optimal attack strategy based on network congestion with maximum damage, considering congestion as a cascade propagation mechanism. Reward functions based on increasing congestion and immediate power loss are compared. Strategies designed with network congestion as the attack reward function produce more vulnerability of the network to sequential attacks. © 2013 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper considers a pricing competition and cooperation problem in a two-echelon supply chain with one common manufacturer and duopoly retailers. Six decentralized game models are built to examine how pricing strategies (Bertrand and collusion) and power structures (manufacturer-dominant, retailers-dominant and non-dominant) affect supply chain members' performance. Specifically, without loss of generality, we rewrite our models as systems including only two parameters (retail substitutability and asymmetric parameter which represents the non-price difference between the two retailers) by standardizing prices and quantities. It is found that, regardless of the power structures, the two retailers' collusion behaviors will increase the sales prices and reduce the quantities of the product. The results demonstrate that whether the duopoly retailers benefit from their collusion behaviors depends on the power structures and the two parameters. We also state the conditions under which the manufacturer is better off giving up its power and making decision simultaneously with the two retailers even if it can move first.

      " Abstract: Glenoid bone loss is a difficult surgical issue that must be adequately addressed during total shoulder arthroplasty. As this is a complex problem with multiple surgical options, complete preoperative evaluation and planning is required. The ultimate goal for surgical management of glenoid bone loss is to re-establish a congruent articulating surface to interact against the humeral prosthesis in an anatomic position. Various surgical techniques have been described to achieve this goal. They include eccentric reaming, various bone grafts (structural versus cancellous), custom-design implants, and soft tissue interposition arthroplasty. In some cases, recreating a concentric glenoid surface without a prosthesis may prove to be the most rational option. All techniques should be considered carefully on an individual basis, as no single method will result in a satisfactory condition for all patients. This article will outline these surgical options, and attempt to formulate a rational approach in the management of glenoid bone loss during total shoulder arthroplasty.

      " Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of TP53 mutations is associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients allografted for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), leading some to question the benefit of an allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) for this patient group, although this has not been studied in a large cohort. METHODS: A total of 780 patients with AML in first complete remission, with either intermediate- or adverse-risk cytogenetics, whose TP53 mutation status was reported, were included in this study from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. RESULTS: Two-year overall survival (OS) was impaired in patients (n = 179) with evidence of a TP53 mutation at diagnosis (35.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26.7–43.7) as compared to the cohort without (n = 601) (64%; 95% CI, 59.1–68.4; P =.001). In patients with mutant TP53 AML with no evidence of either chromosome 17p loss (17p–) and/or complex karyotype (CK) (n = 53, 29.6%), 2-year OS was 65.2% (95% CI, 48.4–77.6). This was not significantly different to patients without TP53 mutations. In patients with mutant TP53 AML with either 17p– and/or CK (n = 126, 70.4%), the OS was lower (24.6%; 95% CI, 16.2–34; P =.001). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the adverse prognostic effect of TP53 mutations in AML following an allo-SCT is not evident in patients with neither co-occurring 17p– and/or CK, and these data inform decisions regarding allo-SCT in patients with TP53 mutant AML. © 2022 The Authors.

      " Abstract: The aim of this study is to examine the possible locations where heat recovery can occur in a triple-pressure cogeneration combined cycle power plant and calculate the amount of waste heat that can be recovered. To complete this objective, an adjusted cycle layout is created and the energy system is analyzed from both thermodynamic and exergetic viewpoints. Furthermore, the Total Revenue Requirement (TRR) method and thermoeconomic analysis are used to determine the price of products produced. The optimization results are displayed in a Pareto chart diagram, utilizing a new model with two objective functions - power cost and product heat. This method allows for identifying the best operating point for these types of power plants, accounting for electricity and heat prices across various regions. The implications of this study for the energy sector are significant as it highlights how waste heat recovery plays a crucial role in cogeneration combined cycle power plants. By pinpointing potential heat recovery locations and determining how much waste heat can be recovered, valuable insights are gained that can inform both design and operation decisions for these power plants. Additionally, using the TRR method and thermoeconomic analysis provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the economic feasibility of this type of system. © 2023 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

The incidences of primary and secondary drug failures in each group and the numbers of patients satisfactorily maintained on each of the hypoglycaemic agents throughout the first year proved remarkably similar. In 61 of the successfully treated patients who were studied by crossover to the other drug and observed for a further year the mean blood glucose concentrations at the end of the year were roughly comparable, but the mean weight response was a small loss of 1.5 ±3.8 kg with metformin but a gain of 4.6±3.9 kg with chlorpropamide. Thus for non-obese, maturity-onset diabetics whose disease cannot be controlled by diet and who require oral treatment sulphonylureas and biguanides are equally effective, the choice depending on whether the patient is underweight and the severity of symptoms. © 1977, British Medical Journal Publishing Group.

      " Abstract: Dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) projections are often put forth to aid resource managers in climate change-related decision making. However, interpreting model results and understanding their uncertainty can be difficult. Sources of uncertainty include embedded assumptions about atmospheric CO2 levels, uncertain climate projections driving DGVMs, and DGVM algorithm selection. For western Oregon and Washington, we implemented an Environmental Evaluation Modeling System (EEMS) decision support model using MC2 DGVM results to characterize biomass loss risk. MC2 results were driven by climate projections from 20 General Circulation Models (GCMs) and Earth System Models (ESMs), under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5, with and without assumed fire suppression, for three different time periods. We produced maps of mean, minimum, and maximum biomass loss risk and uncertainty for each RCP / +/- fire suppression / time period. We characterized the uncertainty due to RCP, fire suppression, and climate projection choice. Finally, we evaluated whether fire or climate maladaptation mortality was the dominant driver of risk for each model run. The risk of biomass loss generally increases in current high biomass areas within the study region through time. The pattern of increased risk is generally south to north and upslope into the Coast and Cascade mountain ranges and along the coast. Uncertainty from climate future choice is greater than that attributable to RCP or +/- fire suppression. Fire dominates as the driving factor for biomass loss risk in more model runs than mortality. This method of interpreting DGVM results and the associated uncertainty provides managers with data in a form directly applicable to their concerns and should prove helpful in adaptive management planning. © 2019 Sheehan, Bachelet.\u001b[0m :\n",

Early results from longitudinal studies show some interesting case studies in which the emissions confirm and extend audiometric results. To collect valid, reliable, long-term data on noise-exposed people, a number of factors must be considered. These factors include (1) choice of stimulus; (2) measurement of the emission, including analyzing bandwidth, absolute or relative emission level, unmeasurable emissions, and noise floor issues; (3) probe fit and ensuring a good stimulus waveform and spectrum; and (4) middle-ear pressure. Emissions can be used in a clinical setting if the test-retest reliability is established for the protocol, equipment, testers, and clinical population of interest.

      " Abstract: If the decision is made not to apply a toroidal chamfer to tungsten monoblocks at ITER divertor vertical targets, exposed leading edges will arise as a result of assembly tolerances between adjacent plasma-facing components. Then, the advantage of glancing magnetic field angles for spreading plasma heat flux on top surfaces is lost at the misaligned edges with an interaction occurring at near normal incidence, which can drive melting for the expected inter-ELM heat fluxes. A dedicated experiment has been performed on the COMPASS tokamak to thoroughly study power deposition on misaligned edges using inner-wall limited discharges on a special graphite tile presenting gaps and leading edges directly viewed by a high resolution infra-red camera. The parallel power flux deducted from the unperturbed measurement far from the gap is fully consistent with the observed temperature increase at the leading edge, respecting the power balance. All the power flowing into the gap is deposited at the leading edge and no mitigation factor is required to explain the thermal response. Particle-in-cell simulations show that the ion Larmor smoothing effect is weak and that the power deposition on misaligned edges is well described by the optical approximation because of an electron dominated regime associated with non-ambipolar parallel current flow. © 2016 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The actual cost of CR equipment, maintenance contracts, and the estimated cost for data storage were compared with the potential savings that could result from eliminating film, decreasing the number of librarians and lost radiographs, and improving technologists' efficiency. RESULTS: After the 1st year, net cash flow from use of soft-copy CR interpretation is projected to result in a slight savings for the radiology department but not enough to offset the capital equipment purchase price. CONCLUSION: Soft-copy CR ICU imaging will not result in a cost savings.

The optimal design problems are solved by using the method of the planning of experiments. The optimization procedure is divided into the following stages: choice of control parameters and establishment of the domain of search, elaboration of plans of experiment for the chosen number of reference points, execution of the experiment, determination of simple mathematical models from the experimental data, design of the structure on the basis of the mathematical models discovered, and finally verification experiments at the point of the optimal solution. Vibration and damping analysis is performed by using a sandwich plate finite elements based on a broken line model. Damping properties of the core and face layers of the plate are taken into account in the optimal design. Modal loss factors are computed using the method of complex eigenvalues or the energy method. Frequencies and modal loss factors of the plate are constraints in the optimal design problem. There are also constraints on geometrical parameters and the bending stiffness of the plate. The mass of the plate is the objective function. Design parameters are the thickness of the plate layers. In the points of experiments computer simulation using FEM is carried out. Using this information, simple mathematical models for frequencies and modal loss factors for the plate are determined. These simple mathematical functions are used as constraints in the nonlinear programming problem, which is solved by random search and the penalty function method. Numerical examples of the optimal design of clamped sandwich and simply supported laminated composite plates are presented. A significant improvement of damping properties of a sandwich plate is observed in comparison with a simple plate of equal natural frequencies. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aquaculture is a diverse food production system, and a high species diversity in aquaculture can make the global food system more resilient. Species diversification could facilitate aquaculture growth through multiple mechanisms and increase the sector's resilience and long-term sustainability. Facing increasing challenges from climate change, disease outbreaks, market fluctuations, and other disturbances, species diversification has become a widely recognized and endorsed development strategy in the policy and scientific communities for the growth and resilience of the aquaculture sector. However, many attempts to establish new species have yielded little long-term success, and the private sector often concentrates efforts on the most advantageous species for rapid growth. This paper presents a comprehensive assessment of aquaculture species diversification at the global, regional (more than 30 country groups), and national (nearly 200 countries) levels, covering the period 1950 to 2020 with a focus on 1990 to 2020. The assessment employs the concept of “effective number of species” as a measure of diversity and uses two sub-indicators to assess within-group versus between-group diversity. The indicator system reveals detailed patterns of species diversity and uncovers different driving forces of species diversification. Additionally, the study maps the status and trends of species diversity to offer a refined perspective on species diversity profiles and diversification patterns. The findings reveal that beneath high species diversity in world aquaculture lies generally low diversity at the national level; nearly half of national aquaculture has no within-group or between-group diversity. Furthermore, species diversification has been losing momentum in recent decades, and concentration has become a more prominent development pathway, with a tendency to drive aquaculture towards a low-diversity system similar to terrestrial farming. Public interventions are crucial to promote species diversification in aquaculture for the sector's resilience and long-term sustainability. It is important to not only reduce the cost of species diversification for the private sector but also to dedicate more public efforts towards increasing its benefits and viability. While diverse diversification patterns among national aquaculture indicate no one-style-fits-all species diversification pathway, a country may draw guidance from others' experiences, especially since countries with similar species diversity profiles or diversification patterns tend to cluster geographically. Evidence-based policymaking and sector management regarding species diversification entail collaborative efforts among policymakers, scientists, and the aquaculture community to expand and refine assessment frameworks, improve data availability and quality, and efficiently utilize information, knowledge, and insights generated by these assessments to inform decision making at various levels. © 2023\u001b[0m :\n",

The sensor is very simply fabricated by splicing ARRW and FRSS based on Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI). The FRSS interference dip is sensitive to external RI and temperature changes, whereas the ARRW structure's loss dip is only sensitive to external temperature. As a result, this sensor can be used to measure both RI and temperature simultaneously. The sensor's maximum RI sensitivity is 108.61 nm/RIU and its maximum temperature sensitivity is 19 pm/ °C in the experiment. This sensor is a good choice when it is necessary to measure RI and temperature at the same time due to its compact size, high sensitivity, low cost, and good stability.  © 2009-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general modeling framework for operational risk management of financial firms. We consider operational risk events as shocks to a financial firm's value process and then study capital investments under preventive and corrective controls to mitigate risk losses. The optimal decisions are made in three scenarios: (i) preventive control only, (ii) corrective control only, and (iii) joint controls. We characterize the optimal control policies within a general modeling framework that comprises these three scenarios and then discuss an exponential risk reduction function. We conclude our work with an application of our model to a data set from a commercial bank. We find that, through a proper investment strategy, we can achieve a significant performance improvement, especially when the risk severity level is high. Moreover, with controls, the value of the firm tends to increase relative to the value of the firm without controls. Hence, the controls are essentially smoothing out the jump losses and increasing the value of the firm. At the bank we analyze we find that with a joint control strategy the bank can achieve profit increases from 7.45% to 11.62% when the risk reduction efficiencies of the two controls are high. In general, our modeling framework, which combines a typical operational risk process with stochastic control, may suggest a new research direction in operations management and operational risk management.

      " Abstract: Background Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common type of congenital heart abnormality with perimembranous VSD (pmVSD) accounting for ∼70% of all VSD. Nowadays, transcatheter closure is the first choice for suitable pmVSD. However, there was no report about closing the large oval-shaped VSD percutaneously. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Case summary A 34-year-old male with known VSD was referred for transcatheter closure after failed attempts in other hospital. Patient had been diagnosed with VSD at a young age, but he was lost to follow-up. He presented with shortness of breath due to heart failure and pulmonary hypertension. The initial measurement of the defect was 6–7 mm by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and LV angiography. However, re-measurement using TEE and 3D echocardiography revealed that the VSD is oval with diameters of 18 mm × 6 mm. Initially, device No. 12/14 was used, but it was dislodged on two attempts. The operator then decided to upsize the device size to No. 16/18 that was successful. The patient’s condition was good, and 6 months follow-up after the procedure showed good outcomes without any residual defect or arrhythmia. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

      " Abstract: Expansion joints are used as a special connection equipment between adjacent buildings to accommodate the relative motions generated by wind, thermal, or earthquake loads, but they often exhibit damage during severe earthquakes. The level of damage and safety factors required to avoid loss of function are not well considered in current design practices. The objective of this paper is to provide quantitative information on the seismic damage probability of common expansion joints and the associated repair costs. The designer and engineer can refer to this information as a basis for decision making in the selection of expansion joints. Four common types of expansion joints are considered: high- and standard-performance floor and wall expansion joints, whose damage states have been evaluated recently by the authors through shaking table tests. First, the fragility functions of expansion joints for seven damage patterns are developed utilizing the test results. Next, the vulnerability of expansion joints installed between adjacent building models is assessed via incremental dynamic analysis. The recommended level of safety factor to ensure the function of expansion joints is discussed. Finally, a procedure for cost-effective selection of expansion joints is introduced, where case studies are examined using buildings with different characteristics. The presented results are deemed to be beneficial for improving the design practice of expansion joints and for reducing future seismic loss. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Tillage and pesticide management are important factors controlling pesticide losses from agricultural watersheds. In this research, tillage activities were mapped from Landsat TM and MODIS data and were used in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate atrazine concentrations in the St. Joseph River in northeastern Indiana. The calibrated and validated model proved to be crucial in making early warning predictions and decisions on atrazine pollution. Average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values of 0.56 and 0.70 were obtained for daily and monthly stream flow calibration, respectively, while those for validation were 0.55 and 0.79, respectively. The best NSE values ranged from 0.06 to 0.42 for daily atrazine calibrations at four locations within the watershed and from 0.01 to 0.29 during validation. Daily and monthly R 2 values at the St. Joseph watershed outlet during the atrazine validation were 0.35 and 0.63, respectively. Although NSE values for some water quality stations were poor, predicted atrazine concentrations compared reasonably well to measured trends at the watershed outlet. Pollution peaks in simulated atrazine concentrations were also within days of measured atrazine concentrations. The research showed that the temporal and spatial trend of tillage activities, which influences the timing and location of atrazine applications, together with application amounts have significant impact on critical areas and concentration levels of atrazine pollution. Uncertainties in observed data could also affect the model outcome. The results showed the potential application in early warning prediction of atrazine pollution and can be used to make appropriate management decisions to mitigate this problem. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: We aimed to determine if a non-contrast screening MRI is cost-effective compared to a full MRI protocol with contrast for the evaluation of vestibular schwannomas. Methods: A decision tree was constructed to evaluate full MRI and screening MRI strategies for patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. If a patient were to have a positive screening MRI, s/he received a full MRI. Vestibular schwannoma prevalence, MRI specificity and sensitivity, and gadolinium anaphylaxis incidence were obtained through literature review. Institutional charge data were obtained using representative patient cohorts. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were completed to determine CE model threshold points for MRI performance characteristics and charges. Results: The mean charge for a full MRI with contrast was significantly higher than a screening MRI ($4089 ± 1086 versus $2872 ± 741; p < 0.05). The screening MRI protocol was more cost-effective than a full MRI protocol with a willingness-to-pay from $0 to 20,000 USD. Sensitivity analyses determined that the screening protocol dominated when the screening MRI charge was less than $4678, and the imaging specificity exceeded 78.2%. The screening MRI protocol also dominated when vestibular schwannoma prevalence was varied between 0 and 1000 in 10,000 people. Conclusion: A screening MRI protocol is more cost-effective than a full MRI with contrast in the diagnostic evaluation of a vestibular schwannoma. A screening MRI likely also confers benefits of shorter exam time and no contrast use. Further investigation is needed to confirm the relative performance of screening protocols for vestibular schwannomas. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

The allowable soil losses were calculated within the risk limits of 0. 01 < r < 0. 1. The lower and upper limits of the allowable soil loss were determined for the soils of different thicknesses. To compare the rates of the soil erosion, one uses the erosion index: the ratio between the actual erosion rate and its maximum allowable value. The actual erosion rate is determined from erosion equations, in which the integrated parameters of the soil loss tolerance include the permissible flow velocity and data on the climatic and soil conditions. From the estimated allowable soil erosion rates, criteria of decision making can be formulated for substantiating the strategy of soil conservation or restoration. © 2013 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Along with high temperature effects, an analysis is made of alterations of mud constituents because of the most frequent contaminations due to the presence of clays, anhydrites and gypsum. High temperatures undoubtedly favour the alteration of some products in mud and speed up particular chemical reactions. This brings about the flocculation of solid matter and the consequent variation of rheological properties. Different kinds of mud and additives suitable for high-temperature operations have been investigated. An account is given, finally, on the costs of drilling muds in different operational conditions. The frequent fractures and cracks of geological formations under examination are borne in mind, and the problem of circulation losses is accordingly dealt with in order to indicate filling-up systems of current use. © 1971.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Dactylogyrus vastator is a hermaphroditic monogenean ectoparasite that attacks fish gills and can rapidly infect entire fish stocks causing economic losses. Chemotherapy is still the first choice among drugs used for the treatment of monogenean infections. However, these chemo-drugs are expensive and may have severe side effects. Hence, there is a need to find out alternative and eco-friendly therapeutics to control and treat these parasitic diseases in fish. Therefore, the present study was conducted to assess the use of dietary Tridax procumbens leaves extract (TPLE) as a functional feed additive to control this possible parasitic infection. Four isonitrogenous diets (300 g/kg crude protein) were prepared to contain 0.0 (control), 2, 4, or 6 g TPLE/kg diet. Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, juveniles (4.6 ± 0.06 g) were fed one of the experimental diets up to apparent satiation thrice a day for 8 weeks. After that, fish from each treatment were exposed to D. vastator solution (40 individual/L) and closely monitored for any fish mortality for 14 days. It is noted that dietary TPLE levels significantly promoted the fish growth and feed consumption but feed conversion ratio and fish survival were not affected. Additionally, dietary TPLE levels significantly enhanced villi length/width and absorption area of fish intestine. Dietary TPLE significantly elevated the antioxidant and immunity responses. Also, post-challenge mortality in TPLE-fed fish was significantly reduced in a directly proportional manner. The lowest fish mortality (10.0%) was observed in fish fed a diet containing 6 g TPLE/kg diet, while highest mortality (36.7%) was recorded in the control fish group. The current study concluded that dietary TPLE has no harm effect on fish welfare and stimulated fish performance, intestinal morphometry, antioxidant, and immunity responses of Nile tilapia as well as its resistance to D. vastator infection with optimum levels of 4–6 g/kg diet. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The primary goal of an exploratory oncology clinical trial is to identify an effective drug for further development. To expedite the drug development process and increase the chance of finding active tumor indications where the treatment works, multiple tumor cohorts are often investigated simultaneously in a basket trial. In this article, we propose a generalized framework of an optimal basket trial design in the exploratory setting where tumor indications can be homogeneous (objective response rates of all indications are the same under both the null and alternative hypotheses) or heterogeneous (objective response rates are not the same under at least one of the null or alternative hypotheses). The proposed design prunes the inactive tumor indication in Stage 1 and pools the remaining tumor indications at the end of Stage 2 to evaluate the overall effectiveness of whether the treatment works in at least one tumor indication. The design parameters are optimized to minimize the expected sample size while explicitly controlling the global Type I and Type II error rates. In addition, we consider reallocating the planned Stage 2 sample size of pruned indications to achieve a higher power when the total planned sample size is fixed.

      " Abstract: Toward the world of Internet of Things, people utilize knowledge from sensor streams in various kinds of smart applications. The number of sensing devices is rapidly increasing along with the amount of sensing data. Consequently, a bottleneck problem at the local gateway has attracted high concern. An example scenario is smart elderly houses in rural areas where each house installs thousands of sensors and all connect to resource-limited and unstable 2G/3G networks. The bottleneck state can incur unacceptable latency and loss of significant data due to the limited waiting-queue. Orthogonally to the existing solutions, we propose a two-tier prioritization system to enhance information quality, indicated by VoI, at the local gateway. The proposed system has been designed to support several requirements with several conflicting criteria over shared sensing streams. Our approach adopts Multicriteria Decision Analysis technique to merge requirements and to assess the VoI. We introduce the framework that can reduce the computational cost by precalculation. Through a case study of building management systems, we have shown that our merge algorithm can provide 0.995 cosine-similarity for representing all user requirements and the evaluation approach can obtain satisfaction values around 3 times higher than the naïve strategies for the top-list data. © 2017 Sunyanan Choochotkaew et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, it is unknown if workers are able to lay in queen cells immediately after queen loss during an episode of emergency queen rearing. In this study we experimentally de-queened colonies and determined the maternity of larvae and pupae that were reared as queens. This allowed us to determine how soon after queen loss workers contribute to the production of new queens. We were further interested to see if workers would preferentially raise new queens from queen-laid brood if this was introduced later. We performed our manipulations in two different settings: an apiary setting where colonies were situated close together and a more natural situation in which the colonies were well separated. This allowed us to determine how the vicinity of other colonies affects the presence of parasites. We found that workers do indeed contribute to queen cell production immediately after the loss of their queen, thus demonstrating that some workers either have activated ovaries even when their colony has a queen or are able to activate their ovaries extremely rapidly. Queen-laid brood introduced days after queen loss was ignored, showing that workers do not prefer to raise new queens from queen brood when given a choice. We also detected non-natal parasitism of queen cells in both settings. We therefore conclude that some A. m. capensis genotypes specialize in parasitizing queen cells. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Even though propeller anemometers are found to give outputs which deviate from the desired cosine relationship by an amount which varies with wind speed, their overall performance is consistent with many atmospheric requirements. Their output per unit wind speed is a function of angle of attack, such that when used as sensors of the vertical or horizontal cross-wind components in the atmosphere, calibration factors may differ by as much as 30 % from those obtained in a normal wind-tunnel calibration procedure (in which wind velocity is parallel to the anemometer shaft). These characteristics are sufficiently important that great care should be taken in using these devices in u-v-w orthogonal arrays. For use in eddy-correlation equipment, it appears that it is best to vane-mount the horizontal sensor to ensure that the appropriate calibration factor is employed. The response lengths of propeller anemometers also vary with angle of attack. Near θ=0 °, the axially-referred response length appears to depend linearly on cos θ, but near θ=90 ° a dependence on cos1/2θ fits the data. No strong effect of wind speed is found. Due to their limited response characteristics, these anemometers give rise to underestimates of the Reynolds stress measured near the surface. The extent of the loss is about 8 % when anemometers in good condition are employed at a height of 5m. Operation at a greater height would allow this error to be reduced. After exposure in the atmosphere for some time, the anemometers tend to respond more slowly and greater losses (of the order 25 %) can occur. Some improvement in performance is possible by the choice of a suitable spatial separation of the sensors. © 1972 D. Reidel Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the neoliberal era, competing to host global sporting events has become a prominent urban promotion strategy, and with a few exceptions, the scholarly focus has been on the western experience. In contrast, this paper focuses on the south experience with specific reference to the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. A common argument is that such sporting events provide global marketing opportunities that can attract foreign investment, which may serve as catalysts for development. A key goal is to promote the status and power of the post-colonial nation-state (although ironically ceding sovereignty to entities like FIFA for the duration of events). While there are some benefits, especially in terms of infrastructure development, the Indian, Brazilian and South African experience suggests that the privileged tend to benefit at the expense of the poor, and socio-economic inequalities were exacerbated. These points are illustrated in this paper with reference to evictions, loss of livelihoods and violations of human rights. Disturbingly, the cost of constructing new sports’ facilities and associated infrastructure escalated phenomenally from the original bid-document estimates, without any public oversight, and some are destined to be white elephants. The mega-events were largely organised and funded by the governments in consultation with the private sector, with little or no accountability to citizens, although such decisions had major implications in terms of the diversion of public spending priorities from more urgent social needs such as housing, healthcare and education. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.\u001b[0m :\n",

Despite the amount of effort put in determining the potential geographic extent of these pests, their environmental suitability maps have not yet been well established. Using MaxEnt model, the potential distribution of the pests has been defined on a global scale. The results show that large areas of the globe, important for production of palms, are suitable for and potentially susceptible to these pests. The main determinants for O. monoceros distribution were; temperature annual range, followed by land cover, and precipitation seasonality. The major determinants for O. rhinoceros were; temperature annual range, followed by precipitation of wettest month, and elevation. The area under the curve values of 0.976 and 0.975, and True skill statistic values of 0.90 and 0.88, were obtained for O. monoceros and O. rhinoceros, respectively. The global simulated areas for O. rhinoceros (1279.00 × 104 km2) were more than that of O. monoceros (610.72 × 104 km2). Our findings inform decision-making and the development of quarantine measures against the two most important pests of palms. © 2022, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Context based entropy coding often faces the conflict of a desire for large templates and the problem of context dilution. We consider the problem of finding the quantizer Q that quantizes the K-dimensional causal context Ci = (Xi-t(1), Xi-t(2),…., Xi-t(K)) of a source symbol Xi into one of M conditioning states. A solution giving the minimum adaptive code length for a given data set is presented (when the cost of the context quantizer is neglected). The resulting context quantizers can be used for sequential coding of the sequence X0, X1, X2,…. A coding scheme based on binary decomposition and context quantization for coding the binary decisions is presented and applied to digital maps and α-plane sequences. The optimal context quantization is also used to evaluate existing heuristic context quantizations.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Fournier's gangrene is an acute and potentially lethal necrotising fasciitis that involves the scrotum and perineum. This disease can result in the loss of skin and soft tissue. To repair the scrotal and perineal defects remains a surgical challenge. Methods: Between January 2000 and December 2008, 50 patients were admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene. We retrospectively reviewed 31 of the 44 surviving patients, who needed reconstructive procedures for coverage of scrotal and perineal soft-tissue defects. The choice of reconstructive procedure was based on the size, location, severity of the defects and the availability of local tissue. The patients' age, predisposing factors, defect size and location, reconstructive procedures and outcomes were reviewed. Results: The mean age of the patients was 53.6 years (range, 20-84 years). The average size of the skin defect was 86 cm2. A total of 12 patients were treated by scrotal advancement flap coverage, nine by split-thickness skin graft, five by pudendal thigh flap, two by gracilis myocutaneous flap, one by gracilis muscle flap plus split-thickness skin graft and three by pedicle anterolateral thigh flap. The overall surgical complication rate was 16%. Conclusions: Early debridement and wound coverage in Fournier's gangrene are mandatory to allow patients to return to normal life. We set up a valuable reconstructive algorithm based on the characteristics of the defects and our 9 years of experience, which adds to the versatility of the armamentarium of the reconstructive surgeon. © 2010 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

      " Abstract: Since climate, environmental and anthropic controls affect ecosystem functioning simultaneously, wetlands are permanently changing at different spatio–temporal scales. Thus, regionalizations based not only on structural, but also on functional features of ecosystems constitute a much-needed baseline towards proper decision-making and environmental management in the context of land degradation and water management infrastructure. Our aim was to identify and characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of ecosystem functional diversity in a highly diverse and altered mosaic of wetland ecosystems and assess its environmental and anthropic controls. The characterization was based on satellite-derived functional units (FUs), involving seven rasterized traits derived from complementary time-series decomposition techniques applied to a 15-year n…. v…… d… i…. (NDVI) product (2001–2015). The study area exhibited a vast functional heterogeneity, strongly related to differing anthropic and hydro-geomorphological features. Vegetation dynamics were increasingly restricted by the precipitation regime in areas naturally or anthropically decoupled from the flood pulse, which also exhibited the lowest ecosystem functional richness. Depicted as morpho-dynamically stable, areas still subject to recurring overflow events and higher water permanence exhibited sustained NDVI values during the growing season. Our study addresses a proper case of globally widespread land degradation processes occurring across several wetland ecosystems on Earth. Particularly, development of unrestricted water management infrastructure and decouplement from the hydrologic regime suggests an ongoing loss of ecosystem functional diversity and constrained carbon gain dynamics. In this context, the spatio-temporal accuracy of our study constitutes a reliable and replicable foundation, suitable for improvement of environmental management in wetland ecosystems. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Two distinct lines of authority had developed. First, a group of House of Lords and Privy Council cases had recognised that a characteristic would only be relevant where it affected the gravity of the provocation. Secondly, a line of Court of Appeal cases had recognised a wider test, whereby a characteristic would also be relevant if it affected the defendant's ability to exercise self-control. The House of Lords has now confirmed the latter test. Consequently, in Smith itself the defendant's severe depression was relevant because it made him less able to exercise self-control. © 2001, Cambridge University Press.

      " Abstract: Information gathered from the patient history, physical examination, and advanced testing augments the decision-making process and is proposed to improve the probability of diagnostic and prognostic accuracy. However, these findings may provide inconsistent results and can lead to errors in decision-making. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between common clinical complaints and specific findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with chronic neck dysfunction. Forty-five English-speaking participants (25 female), with mean age of 52 (SD = 13.4), were evaluated by a neurosurgeon for complaints of symptoms related to the cervical spine. All participants answered a subjective questionnaire and received an MRI of the cervical spine. Cramer's V nominal correlation was performed to explore the relationship between the targeted variables. The correlation matrix calculations captured three significant findings. Evidence of spinal cord compression was significantly correlated to 1) anteroposterior canal diameter of less than or equal to 9 mm (r = .31; p<0.05) and 2) diminished subarachnoid fluid around the cord (r = .48; p<0.01). Report of loss of dexterity was significantly correlated with 3) report of lower extremity clumsiness (r = .33; p<0.05). In this study, no definitive relationships were found between the clinical complaints of neck pain, hand function, or clumsiness and specific MRI findings of spinal cord compression.

      " Abstract: Background: Losing children to follow-up is one of the major barriers identified in Ethiopia’s immunization programme. In many urban slum areas like Lideta sub-city, Addis Ababa, several demand- and supply-side factors affect the follow-up visits for routine immunization services, so this study aimed to explore the influence of linkages, a feedback mechanism, and caregiver mobility on immunization follow-up visits. Methods: The study team employed a qualitative method and conducted 30 in-depth interviews with caregivers, 26 interviews with key informants, and five focus group discussions with health officials and decision-makers. A deductive content and thematic analysis was carried out by importing the transcripts into OpenCodes, applying the a priori codes, and identifying new codes and themes. Results: The linkages among health facilities included those from hospitals to health centres, from hospitals to hospitals, and from health centres to health centres within and outside the sub-city. Using these linkages, most vaccinators transfer caregivers without providing multi-dose vial (MDV) vaccines, mainly bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) and measles-containing vaccines (MCV), “to minimize wastage” and thus successfully reduce vaccine wastage rates; yet most caregivers wasted their time, energy, and money travelling from one health facility to another. Despite some efforts to transfer caregivers using “transferal slips” and informal phone calls to vaccinators’ friends, unfortunately, there was no formally established system for obtaining feedback about the arrival of caregivers and continuation of the follow-up visits. Overall, the transfer process lacked uniformity, used various approaches, and was not systematic. Conclusions: Transferal of caregivers for the sake of minimizing wastage of MDV vaccines without checking the vaccination schedules of the receiving health facilities, using various informal types of tools and approaches, along with a poor follow-up and feedback system, were major identified challenges which cost caregivers extra money, energy, and time in getting timely immunization services. Therefore, the Federal Ministry of Health should strengthen the linkages among facilities, ensure the establishment of formal communications by developing guidelines and standardized tools – transferal slips and approaches – and initiate a fast feedback provision system using SMS text messages. © 2021, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background and Objectives: Fibrosarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma (STS) that has two peaks of incidence in pediatric patients: one in infants and young childern (infantile fibrosarcoma), another in older children (\"adult type\" fibrosarcoma). The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical features and the treatment results in patients affected by fibrosarcoma enrolled in two consecutive studies run by the STS-Italian Cooperative Group (ICG) between 1979 and 1995. Patients and Methods: Twenty-five evaluable patients were grouped according the intergroup rhabdomyosarcoma staging (IRS) system: 12 Gr I, 5 Gr II, 8 Gr III. The cut-off point between the two forms was considered the age of 2 years: 14 patients were affected by infantile and 11 by adult type of fibrosarcoma. The therapeutic guidelines were not strict and not different for the two forms: patients with initial macroscopic excision (Gr I-II) were given IVA or VAC; Gr III had VAC or VAIA and subsequent excision, if feasible. Radiation therapy (RT) was delivered in patients > 3 years with microscopic (42 Gy) and macroscopic (54 Gy) residuals. Results: Thirteen patients are alive without evidence of disease: 10 in first complete remission (CR), 7 Gr I, 1 Gr II, 2 Gr III, 3 in second CR after local relapse (LR) (2 Gr I, 1 Gr II). Two Gr I patients are alive with metastatic relapse. Nine patients died: six of progressive disease (PD) (three Gr II, three Gr III), two because of a second tumor (one Gr I, one Gr III) and one because of other causes (Gr III). One Gr III patient was lost at follow up, 2 years from diagnosis. The 10 years overall survival (OS) is 67.4% and the progression-free survival (PFS) is 52.2%. The OS for patients < 2 years is 78.6% (11 of 14), versus 51% for patients > 2 years (5 of 11). Conclusions: The complete excision at diagnosis was the treatment of choice and was related to the best outcome. Microscopical residuals were difficult to treat with chemo-radiotherapy in both forms of fibrosarcoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (CT) obtained a partial remission (PR) only in three of eight cases, while no conclusions concerning the efficacy of CT for infantile forms are possible. Patients < 2 years had a better outcome than the older ones: most of them had a tumor on extremities which was excised at diagnosis. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: In England, since 2015, there has been a formal drive to integrate pharmacists into general practice as a new healthcare service. Research efforts have offered insights into how general practice-based professionals and patients view the service, however, they took no account of community pharmacy teams' opinions. There have been anecdotal statements about opposition from community pharmacies to the service, due to fears of losing business. The aim of the current study was to identify the experiences and perceptions of community pharmacy teams regarding pharmacists' presence in general practice. Methods: The National Health Service Choices website was used to identify community pharmacies within a radius of two miles from eight West London general practices. The search resulted in 104 community pharmacies which were all contacted via telephone. Pharmacy staff who verbally expressed their interest to participate were then provided with the study's documents. Qualitative, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were conducted inside the pharmacy from which each participant was recruited. Interviews lasted 30 to 45 min and were audio-recorded. Audio-recordings were transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. Results: Forty-eight community pharmacy staff participated. Four themes were discerned: awareness (\"I knew that [pharmacists] have already been implemented [in general practice] but I haven't really followed it ⋯ where does the pharmacist role come?\"); interactions (\"I'm just so pleased that there's a pharmacist professional in the general practice ⋯ because we speak the same language!\"); patient care (\"if I was a patient knowing that there is a general practitioner and a pharmacist [in general practice], I would ⋯ think 'nothing can go wrong at the moment'\"); and funding challenges (\"if general practices take on the extra responsibility of stop smoking or flu vaccination campaigns ⋯ financially, this would affect this pharmacy\").

      " Abstract: In recent years, cyber-attacks against businesses and organizations have increased. Such attacks usually result in significant damage to the organization, such as the loss and/or leakage of sensitive and confidential information. Because email communication is an integral part of daily business operations, attackers frequently leverage email as an attack vector in order to initially penetrate the targeted organization. Email message allows the attacker to deliver dangerous content to the victim, such as malicious attachments or links to malicious websites. Existing email analysis solutions analyze only specific parts of the email using rule-based methods, while other important parts remain unanalyzed. Existing anti-virus engines primarily use signature-based detection methods, and therefore are insufficient for detecting new unknown malicious emails. Machine learning methods have been shown to be effective at detecting maliciousness in various domains and particularly in email. Previous works which used machine learning methods suggested sets of features which offer a limited perspective over the whole email message. In this paper, we propose a novel set of general descriptive features extracted from all email components (header, body, and attachments) for enhanced detection of malicious emails using machine learning methods. The proposed features are extracted just from the email itself; therefore, our features are independent, since the extraction process does not require an Internet connection or the use of external services or other tools, thereby meeting the needs of real-time detection systems. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our new novel features against sets of features suggested by previous academic work using a collection of 33,142 emails which contains 38.73% malicious and 61.27% benign emails. The results show that malicious emails can be detected effectively when using our novel features with machine learning algorithms. Moreover, our novel features enhance the detection of malicious emails when used in conjunction with features suggested by related work. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest detection rates, with an AUC of 0.929, true positive rate (TPR) of 0.947, and false positive rate (FPR) of 0.03. We also present the IDR (integrated detection rate), a new measure which helps calibrate the threshold of a machine learning classifier in order to achieve the optimal TP and FP rates, which are the most important measures for a real-time and practical cyber-security application. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered many mysteries about SARS-CoV-2, including its potential to trigger abnormal autoimmune responses. Emerging evidence suggests women may face higher risks from COVID-induced autoimmunity manifesting as persistent neurological symptoms. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying this female susceptibility is now imperative. We synthesize key insights from existing studies on how COVID-19 infection can lead to immune tolerance loss, enabling autoreactive antibodies and lymphocyte production. These antibodies and lymphocytes infiltrate the central nervous system. Female sex hormones like estrogen and X-chromosome mediated effects likely contribute to dysregulated humoral immunity and cytokine profiles among women, increasing their predisposition. COVID-19 may also disrupt the delicate immunological balance of the female microbiome. These perturbations precipitate damage to neural damage through mechanisms like demyelination, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration – consistent with the observed neurological sequelae in women. An intentional focus on elucidating sex differences in COVID-19 pathogenesis is now needed to inform prognosis assessments and tailored interventions for female patients. From clinical monitoring to evaluating emerging immunomodulatory therapies, a nuanced women-centered approach considering the hormonal status and immunobiology will be vital to ensure equitable outcomes. Overall, deeper insights into the apparent female specificity of COVID-induced autoimmunity will accelerate the development of solutions mitigating associated neurological harm.

      " Abstract: Objectives: To test the performance of new variants of models to identify people at risk of an emergency hospital admission. We compared (1) the impact of using alternative data sources (hospital inpatient, A&E, outpatient and general practitioner (GP) electronic medical records) (2) the effects of local calibration on the performance of the models and (3) the choice of population denominators. Design: Multivariate logistic regressions using person-level data adding each data set sequentially to test value of additional variables and denominators. Setting: 5 Primary Care Trusts within England. Participants: 1 836 099 people aged 18-95 registered with GPs on 31 July 2009. Main outcome measures: Models to predict hospital admission and readmission were compared in terms of the positive predictive value and sensitivity for various risk strata and with the receiver operating curve C statistic. Results: The addition of each data set showed moderate improvement in the number of patients identified with little or no loss of positive predictive value. However, even with inclusion of GP electronic medical record information, the algorithms identified only a small number of patients with no emergency hospital admissions in the previous 2 years. The model pooled across all sites performed almost as well as the models calibrated to local data from just one site. Using population denominators from GP registers led to better case finding. Conclusions: These models provide a basis for wider application in the National Health Service. Each of the models examined produces reasonably robust performance and offers some predictive value. The addition of more complex data adds some value, but we were unable to conclude that pooled models performed less well than those in individual sites. Choices about model should be linked to the intervention design.

      " Abstract: Equipment has been developed to enable KrF excimer laser ablation machining of a bisphenol A polycarbonate sample under closed thick film flowing liquid immersion. The liquid medium is easily changeable, offering the possibility of chemical modification of the material etching mechanism. Previous work usingamedium offiltered tap water has proven the ability of this equipment to control debris; however, this medium had the simultaneous consequence of modifying the primary ablation characteristics from those achieved in ambient air. De-ionized (DI) water is a chemically similar medium that displays contrasting electrostatic properties and was used in this work with the intention of modifying the adhesion mechanisms active. Use of DI water resulted in close agreement of ablation characteristics observed using filtered tap water. Etch rate and threshold displayed a marginal loss in machining efficiency by magnitudes of 11.7% and 4.3% respectively when using DI water for immersion of laser ablation compared to filtered water. This loss is proposed to be caused by increased colloidal groupingof small debris particles to form medium sized items that more completely attenuate the laser beam. As with filtered water, the etch efficiency was also found to be flow velocity dependent due to changing fluid flow-plume interaction states. The mode of debris control afforded by the use of DI water as a laser ablation immersion medium was similar to that of filtered water. But, the volume of debris deposited was significantly greater and was deposited in closer proximity to the feature. Electrostatic insulation by DI water allows greater attraction of particles to the surface due to the suppression of Yukawa forces. Moreover, the action of colloidal aggregation of particles caused DI water to deposit a proportionally large volume of medium sized debris when compared to the proportional population of medium sized debris deposited by filtered water. This work demonstrates that choice of medium offers the immersed laser ablation user control of ablation characteristics without modification of laser parameters. © 2010 Old City Publishing, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the electrical discharge machining process optimization domain, a dominant approach to optimization is the Taguchi method, which is favoured for its simplicity and low-cost implementation requirements. However, the results obtained from the Taguchi method have been criticized as susceptible to errors and wrong decisions since it is based on crisp numerical values. Unfortunately, the impact of such wrong decisions cannot be tolerated as it has a chain effect on the non-financial aspects of the organization’s practice such as loss of goodwill. To reverse this issue, research is urgently desired. This article aims to optimize and fuzzifier the electrical discharge machining process parameters using the Taguchi method and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method. This article introduces a capturing mechanism of uncertainty and imprecision aspects into the Taguchi method and the Taguchi method has been modified as a new method termed the Taguchi method fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method (T-FAHP). The T-FAHP converts the crisp numerical values into fuzzy numbers which were optimized. The optimal parametric settings and rankings of factors were determined. The optimal parametric settings, delta values, ranks and comparison results were pursued. It was found that the optimal parametric setting did not change from those of the T-AHP results. It yielded A1B1C1D1E1F1 interpreted as pulse on time (160units), pulse off time (40units), pulse current (70 units), gap voltage (20 units), wire feed (4 units) and wire tension (4 units). The ranks were led by pulse current and last by wire feed. The ranking occurred in a different order but the first and the last positions were assigned to pulse current and wire feed, respectively. For the delta values, considering Taguchi AHP against when using the Taguchi-fuzzy analytical hierarchy process, we had a reduction of 16.49% for the pulse current, an increase of 28.57%, for the pulse off time, a decrease of 55.56%, for the gap voltage, no changes, for wire feed, no changes, for wire tension, an increase of roughly 10%.

They have no compasses, so do not even have a common notion of North.

      " Abstract: Background: Glaucoma is a leading cause of avoidable blindness worldwide. Open angle glaucoma is the most common type of glaucoma. No randomised controlled trials have been conducted evaluating the effectiveness of glaucoma screening for reducing sight loss. It is unclear what the most appropriate intervention to be evaluated in any glaucoma screening trial would be. The purpose of this study was to develop the clinical components of an intervention for evaluation in a glaucoma (open angle) screening trial that would be feasible and acceptable in a UK eye-care service. Methods. A mixed-methods study, based on the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for complex interventions, integrating qualitative (semi-structured interviews with 46 UK eye-care providers, policy makers and health service commissioners), and quantitative (economic modelling) methods. Interview data were synthesised and used to revise the screening interventions compared within an existing economic model. Results: The qualitative data indicated broad based support for a glaucoma screening trial to take place in primary care, using ophthalmic trained technical assistants supported by optometry input. The precise location should be tailored to local circumstances. There was variability in opinion around the choice of screening test and target population. Integrating the interview findings with cost-effectiveness criteria reduced 189 potential components to a two test intervention including either optic nerve photography or screening mode perimetry (a measure of visual field sensitivity) with or without tonometry (a measure of intraocular pressure). It would be more cost-effective, and thus acceptable in a policy context, to target screening for open angle glaucoma to those at highest risk but for both practicality and equity arguments the optimal strategy was screening a general population cohort beginning at age forty. Conclusions: Interventions for screening for open angle glaucoma that would be feasible from a service delivery perspective were identified. Integration within an economic modelling framework explicitly highlighted the trade-off between cost-effectiveness, feasibility and equity. This study exemplifies the MRC recommendation to integrate qualitative and quantitative methods in developing complex interventions. The next step in the development pathway should encompass the views of service users. © 2011 The Glaucoma screening Platform Study group; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: A major contribution of this work is to develop an efficient hybrid technique for building energy resilience against natural disasters, which cause power outages for commercial and residential buildings. The novelty of the proposed method is the combination of Chicken Search Optimization and the Spike Neural Network learning algorithm. The buildings are designed using shared electric vehicle parking station. Buildings are modeled with peer-to-peer functionality. Electric vehicle inside the parking station are available in a variety of forms, as the commercial building utilizes parking station at day time, also the residential building mostly utilizes at midnight. These variations help vehicles to be utilized for additional hours. A building is maintained through power management options to deal with these interruptions. The choices include peer-to-peer building operation, electric vehicle charging and discharging, partial charge capability, load reduction, and load adjustment. The proposed technique makes use of building components and does not require any additional components for building energy management. The main contribution of this paper is to diminish energy costs and increase energy resilience to natural disasters. Resiliency is described as the ability to restore harmful loads while experiencing minimum power loss after successive power outages. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated using the MATLAB platform and compared to existing systems. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Tire operating temperature is of vital concern to tire engineers because it relates both service life and power loss in a tire. Operating temperature therefore is a limiting factor in the choice of construction materials for truck tires, which run at much higher temperatures than do automotive tires. The power loss as well as hysteresis can be correlated to loss tangent of the compounds both at cure and following the service life. The loss tangent is negatively affected when the system faces conditions responsible for degradation. The antireversion agent, 1,3 bis(citraconimido)methyl benzene (Perkalink 900) counteracts reversion and degradation in both truck and passenger tire tread. Perkalink 900 is found to stabilize the changes in the dynamic properties following ageing.

      " Abstract: Background: Male obesity is increasing and, despite well-established links between obesity and ill-health, men appear reluctant to engage in weight loss programmes. This reticence may reflect a general failure to recognise gender issues in weight management. Community nurses working in partnership with a community dietitian in Camelon, a deprived area of Scotland, have developed a group-based weight management programme specifically for obese men. This paper provides an evaluation of the first 4 years of the Camelon model's operation. Methods: Anonymised databases from local Men's Health Clinics and the weight management programme were consulted to determine the reach and weight loss outcomes of the Camelon model. These databases also provided the demographic and health characteristics of weight management participants. Finally, focus groups obtained the views of participants and their wives. Results: The majority (76.2%) of the obese men who enrolled in a weight management group completed the 12-week programme: of these, 44.3 % achieved ≥5% weight loss. The model's reach was 11.4% and participants were highly representative of the target population. Health risks and being described as \"obese\" were the main motivators reported for joining. Participants appreciated the flexible approach to weight management, the humour, the rapport with the nurses and other men, and found advice about positive food and exercise choices useful. Conclusion: The Camelon model offers a gender-specific intervention for obesity that could be adopted in other primary care settings. Whilst a single approach to weight management is unlikely to appeal to all men, the model engaged a significant number of a traditionally hard-to-reach population. © 2009 WPMH GmbH.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Including a diverse set of stakeholders in collaborative land use planning processes is facilitated by data and maps that communicate and inform an array of possible planning options and potential scenarios of future land use change. In northern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the African Wildlife Foundation (AWF) has engaged stakeholders and the DRC Government to lead a participatory zoning process in the Maringa-Lopori-Wamba (MLW) Landscape. To assist landscape scale macro-zoning efforts, we employed a spatial allocation decision support tool called Marxan to develop a set of three scenarios of potential human and agricultural expansion for 2050. The results offer guidance to stakeholders and assist decision-makers in determining the most suitable land for inclusion in a proposed Rural Development Zone (RDZ), designed to accommodate the expansion of agricultural activities and subsequent deforestation while considering conservation priority areas. We used data describing current patterns of human activity, including historical primary forest loss, land cover suitability for agricultural activity, and presence of important wildlife connectivity zones and protected areas to identify locations where future agricultural expansion might be encouraged. We found that future agricultural demands can be met by expansion around historically intensive agricultural areas in the eastern portion of MLW without significantly compromising conservation priority areas. Wildlife connectivity zones are most vulnerable to future agricultural expansion because of their proximity to current agricultural activity. Our results demonstrate the need to prioritize conservation action in these areas and illustrate how competing needs might be balanced in planning for both agricultural expansion and terrestrial biological conservation in this landscape. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Methods The clinical data of 548 patients with idiopathic hemifacial spasm treated by microvascular decompression surgery were retrospectively analysed. Patients were divided into 5 groups according to compression on different zones of facial nerve by offending vessels. Root exit point was compressed in 31 patients (group A), transitional zone of brainstem was compressed in 59 patients (group B), attached segment of brainstem was compressed in 47 patients (group C), distal cisternal portion was compressed in 28 patients (group D), and two or more zones were compressed in 383 patients (group E). The therapeutic effect was observed, and complete remission and partial remission were regarded as effectiveness. Results Patients were followed up for 0.5 to 2 years.

      " Abstract: What motivates growers to make changes in their business? Some growers are motivated by saving time or money, while for others, reducing environmental impacts or improving consumer perceptions is key. Growers may not always consider all of the impacts of irrigation and fertilization management on other decisions (i.e., cost, labor intensity, sustainability). Helping growers understand and modify current practices, using operation-specific information is critical to addressing this question. Models can help growers address questions specific to their operation, can demonstrate the impact of current practices, and predict the impact of changes on cost, labor, environmental benefits, etc. A disinfection model is the first in a series of models being developed to simulate what happens when irrigation water is recycled. The model series will incorporate published research data and user-supplied data to inform growers about the impacts (and benefits) of current and prospective practices. An important caveat is that models are valid only to the extent of the precision of their underlying data. Model assumptions, input parameters, and any data gaps need to be identified, and guidance for their use provided. This model series uses a system dynamics framework implemented in isee Stella® to simulate responses over time. Stella® permits the development of models with varied complexities, has both a user-friendly interface and the capacity to publish and download completed models from an Internet library. Developed models can function both independently or sequentially. The overarching goal of this model series is to help assess the impacts of current practices, and understand how various changes may impact the business, either positively or negatively. Other models under development will aid in understanding pond dynamics, irrigation and runoff dynamics, nutrient uptake and loss, pesticide movement, plant pathogen dynamics, and water treatment systems, which will use data from published research and ongoing experiments in these areas. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The purpose of this study was to identify (1) methods used to assess reactive postural control in clinical practice and (2) factors associated with regular assessment of reactive postural control. A cross-sectional survey was conducted. Three hundred and fifty-seven physiotherapists in Ontario, Canada who treated adults with balance impairments answered questions about the components of balance they assess and how they assess reactive control in their practice. Of the 273 respondents who assessed reactive postural control at least some of the time, 15.4% used a standardized measure, 79.1% used a non-standardized approach, and 5.5% used both. Forty-five methods of assessing reactive control were reported. The most common methods used were non-standardized perturbations (43.5%; 104/239 respondents) and movement observation (18.8%; 45/239). The remaining 43 methods were each used by less than 8% of respondents. Practice area had the strongest association with regular assessment of reactive postural control (>60% of the time), and respondents working with neurological disorders were more likely to regularly evaluate reactive control than those working with people with orthopedic conditions. Despite the availability of valid standardized measures to evaluate reactive postural control, respondents relied primarily on non-standardized approaches and observational assessment.

The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a prognostic nomogram to predict survival and aid physicians and patients in the decision-making process regarding treatment options. Materials and Methods Clinicopathologic variables and treatment outcomes of 239 patients who were diagnosed with MESCC and received either fluorouracil/cisplatin (FP) or capecitabine/ cisplatin (XP) as first-line chemotherapy were reviewed. A nomogram was developed as a prognostic scoring system incorporating significant clinical and laboratory variables based on a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. An independent series of 61 MESCC patients treated with FP served as an independent data set for nomogram validation. Results No difference in response rate was observed between the FP group (44.8%) and the XP group (54.2%). Similarly, no significant differences in median progression-free survival and median overall survival were observed between regimen groups. Multivariate analysis showed that poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] status≥2), weight loss (10% of the weight loss for 3 months), low albumin level (≤3.5 g/dL), and absence of previous esophagectomy at the time of chemotherapy were significantly associated with low OS in both groups (p<0.05). Based on these findings, patients were classified into favorable (score, 0 to 90), intermediate (91-134), and poor (>135) prognostic groups. The median survival for those with a favorable ECOG was 13.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.8 to 18.6 months), for intermediate 11.2 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 11.9 months), and for poor, 7.0 months (95% CI, 3.6 to 10.0 months). External validation of the nomogram in a different patient cohort yielded significantly similar findings.

One of the common ways to cope with grief is alcohol or substance intake. The course and resolution of grief vary depending upon many factors. Hypnotherapy has been useful and effective in addressing grief reactions as well as associated manifestation, such as sleep problems, depressive features, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It might be a good choice of treatment while dealing with patients having underlying issues or maladaptive coping mechanisms. This is a single case study design hypothesized to indicate maladaptive coping of increased alcohol consumption to deal with the death of a young son. The case had been treated as alcohol dependent syndrome with multiple hospitalizations without addressing underlying grief. The treatment approach was changed, and grief was addressed using hypnotherapy. Clinical hypnotherapy helped address grief and facilitated the index case to accept the loss. This resulted in minimizing hospitalizations, abstinence and improved day-to-day functioning along with the use of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the loss.

Responses to structured interviews indicated that a wide range of actions are employed to reduce flood impact, although these actions are not perceived as specific adjustments to flooding. The only widely acknowledged means of mitigating the flood threat is government action. Dependency on government action reflects the government's role in dispensing aid to flood victims. While relief programmes do reduce personal, short-term losses, they simultaneously encourage resettlement in high-risk areas. In seeking a viable, long-term management policy, the Sri Lankan government recently adopted a plan to move the municipality of Ratnapura to invulnerable high ground. In making the decision to relocate, however, the attitudes of the residents were not evaluated, and government officials seemed unconcerned that residents viewed relocation as an unacceptable solution to the problem. Although individual attitudes concerning residential satisfaction in the context of the flood hazard varied with factors such as income, length of residency and land tenure, an overwhelming number of residents adamantly maintained that they would not move to the new town. © 1984.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Gastrocolic fistula as a result of benign gastric ulcer is a rare occurrence. Fifteen cases have been reported in the literature. Most benign gastric ulcers are situated on the lesser curvature of the stomach and are, thus, not in close proximity to the transverse colon. The most common presenting symptoms are diarrhea, weight loss, and foulsmelling eructations. From this presented experience with a 49-year-old male patient, barium enema is the most reliable diagnostic study, and “block” resection of the distal stomach, fistulous tract, and segment of transverse colon is the treatment of choice. © 1972, American Medical Association.

      " Abstract: To update evidence-based best practice guidelines for obtaining informed consent from weight loss surgery (WLS) patients, with an emphasis on appropriate content and communications approaches that might enhance patient understanding of the information, we performed a systematic search of English-language literature published between April 2004 and May 2007 in MEDLINE and the Cochrane database. Keywords included WLS and informed consent, comprehension, health literacy, and patient education; and WLS and outcomes, risk, patient safety management, and effectiveness. Recommendations are based on the most current literature and the consensus of the expert panel; they were graded according to systems used in established evidence-based models. We identified over 120 titles, 38 of which were reviewed in detail. Evidence suggests that WLS outcomes, including long-term rates of relapse, vary by procedure. For some weight loss surgeries, long-term outcomes may not be known. Risks also vary by patient and provider characteristics. Informed consent should incorporate realistic projections of the short- and long-term risks, benefits, and consequences of surgery, as well as alternatives to WLS. For consent to be informed, the education process should continue until the patient demonstrates comprehension of all relevant material and concepts. Confirmation of comprehension can protect patients engaged in the process of consent for WLS. Future research should focus on the outcomes and consequences of WLS, and different approaches that facilitate patient understanding of, and decision making about, WLS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: A reduction of energy service demand is a climate mitigation option, but its effectiveness has never been quantified. We quantify the effectiveness of energy service demand reduction in the building, transport, and industry sectors using the Asia-Pacific Integrated Assessment/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model for the period 2015-2050 under various scenarios. There were two major findings. First, a 25% energy service demand reduction in the building, transport, and basic material industry sectors would reduce the GDP loss induced by climate mitigation from 4.0% to 3.0% and from 1.2% to 0.7% in 2050 under the 450ppm and 550ppm CO2 equivalent concentration stabilization scenarios, respectively. Second, the effectiveness of a reduction in the building sector's energy service demand would be higher than those of the other sectors at the same rate of the energy service demand reduction. Furthermore, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis of different socioeconomic conditions, and the climate mitigation target was found to be a key determinant of the effectiveness of energy service demand reduction measures. Therefore, more certain climate mitigation targets would be useful for the decision makers who design energy service demand reduction measures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Cover crops can have significant impacts on minimizing soil erosion by wind, which is a common problem in the arid southwest. A study was conducted at NMSU Leyendecker Plant Science Center, Las Cruces, New Mexico, to evaluate the impacts of selected summer cover crops on soil loss during wind erosion events. Four summer grass species [Japanese millet (Echinochloa esculenta), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), brown top millet (Urochloa ramosa (L.) Nguyen), and sorghum sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor × S. bicolor var. Sudanese)] were randomly assigned to four blocks under two irrigation regimes (full-irrigation and deficit-irrigation). Results showed significant effect of grasses on horizontal soil flux compared to control under both irrigation regimes. When comparing the grasses, sorghum sudan grass performed better than the other tested summer cover crops for soil surface protection from wind erosion with its higher ground coverage, higher plant density, taller plant height and higher amount of biomass, while brown top millet was least effective in terms of plant and erosion control characteristics (P≤0.05). Pearl millet and Japanese millet performed better than brown top millet, but was as effective as sorghum sudan as barriers against the wind erosion. Therefore, sorghum sudan is a prominent cover crop for summer in the arid zones of desert southwest. Producers of this region can be significantly benefited from the current research recommendations about cover crops choices for summer season.  © 2021 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

We comprehensively evaluated, repaired and refined an existing CityGML ontology to produce an improved version that could pass the necessary tests and complete unit test development. A corresponding data transformation tool, originally designed to work alongside CityGML, was extended. This allowed for the transformation of original data into a form of semantic triples. We compared various scalable technologies for this semantic data storage and chose Blazegraph™ as it provided the required geospatial search functionality. We also evaluated scalable hardware data solutions and file systems using the publicly available CityGML 2.0 data of Charlottenburg in Berlin, Germany as a working example. The structural isomorphism of the CityGML schemas and the OntoCityGML Tbox allowed the data to be transformed without loss of information. Efficient geospatial search algorithms allowed us to retrieve building data from any point in a city using coordinates. The use of named graphs and namespaces for data partitioning ensured the system performance stayed well below its capacity limits. This was achieved by evaluating scalable and dedicated data storage hardware capable of hosting expansible file systems, which strengthened the architectural foundations of the target system. © 2021\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the Monty Hall dilemma, an individual chooses between three options, only one of which will deliver a prize. After the initial choice, one of the nonchosen options is revealed as a losing option, and the individual can choose to stay with the original choice or switch to the other remaining option. Previous studies have found that most adults stay with their initial choice, although the chances of winning are 2/3 for switching and 1/3 for staying. Pigeons, college students, and preschool children were given many trials on this task to examine how their choices might change with experience. The college students began to switch on a majority of trials much sooner than the pigeons, contrary to the findings by Herbranson and Schroeder (2010) that pigeons perform better than people on this task. In all three groups, some individuals approximated the optimal strategy of switching on every trial, but most did not. Many of the preschoolers immediately showed a pattern of always switching or always staying and continued this pattern throughout the experiment. In a condition where the probability of winning was 90% after a switch, all college students and all but one pigeon learned to switch on nearly every trial. The results suggest that one main impediment to learning the optimal strategy in the Monty Hall task, even after repeated trials, is the difficulty in discriminating the different reinforcement probabilities for switching versus staying. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

Regaining a functional limb is a challenge in avulsion amputations when there is entire loss of a compartment as it happens in proximal third of forearm amputations or when the avulsion occurs through the musculotendinous junction. In these circumstances, primary repair of the long flexors or extensors is not possible and options of secondary tendon transfers do not exist due to lack of donor tendons. These factors could weigh in negatively in making the decision for replantation at the time of presentation. We are presenting a series of 5 cases of avulsion amputation of the forearm wherein the functional outcome was enhanced by secondary Free Functional Muscle transfers (FFMT) using gracilis for finger flexion. Outcome scores improved from Chen IV to II in three patients and to III in two patients. The feasibility of gaining useful outcome through secondary procedures like FFMT should serve as an encouragement to extend the indications for replantation in avulsion amputations of the forearm. © 2019\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Although different fixation techniques for the Akin osteotomy have been described in the literature, there are no many studies trying to analyze the differences between the types of fixation available. The aim of this study is to analyze if there are any differences between three types of staple fixation available in the market. Method: We present a retrospective study of 145 cases in which an Akin osteotomy was performed and fixed with three different kinds of implants staple A (28%), staple B (45%), and staple C (27%). Staple A is made out of stainless steel, and the surgeon mechanically controls the compression applied. Staple B increases the compression when heat is applied to it. Staple C has an intrinsic elastic memory that closes the osteotomy. In all cases, distal articular set angle, interphalangeal joint obliquity angle, and metatarsophalangeal angle were measured pre-operatively and 1.5 months post-operatively on dorsoplantar weight-bearing radiographs. Other details such as post-operative complications, implant migration, osteolysis, or fracture of the lateral cortex during surgery were also recorded. Results: Clinical and radiological results show no relevant differences between the three types of fixation. The mean angular corrections of DASA, interphalangeal joint obliquity angle, and metatarsophalangeal angle were 5, 12, and 21, respectively, for staple A; 4, 10, and 19, respectively, for staple B; and 7, 10, and 23, respectively, for staple C. The rates of intra-operative and post-operative complications were similar for all groups. There was one case of infection per group. We had five cases of delayed union two with staple A and three with staple C. In four cases, there was a loss of correction, two of them fixed with staple A and two with staple C. Seven cases developed a Südeck’s syndrome, four of them fixed with staple A and three with staple C. Fifteen patients suffered an uncontrolled fracture of the lateral cortex of the phalanx when performing the osteotomy (3, 8, and 4 cases fixed with staples A, B, and C, respectively), and 87.5% of the patients that developed a plantar displacement of the osteotomy had an uncontrolled fracture of the lateral cortex (p < 0.05). All three staples achieved a rigid internal fixation and minimal periosteum damage and provided a good bone-bone contact. Conclusions: According to our results, the radiological differences are minimal, and although the thermal compression staple had less complication, clinical differences were also not statistically significant. This means the choice of implant could be left to the surgeon’s preferences or made according to cost. © 2020, SICOT aisbl.\u001b[0m :\n",

A multi-state Markov model was applied in a cohort of 2126 patients to estimate impact of these factors on patients' clinical and immunological evolutions. Clinical progression and immunological deterioration shared most of their prognostic factors: male gender, intravenous drug use, weight loss, low haemoglobin level (< 110 g/l), CD8 cell count (< 500/mm3) and HIV viral load (> 5 log10 copies/ml). Highly active retroviral therapy reduced the risks of clinical progression and immune deterioration whatever patients' CD4 cell count. Risk reductions were 41-60% for protease inhibitor-based and 27-68% for non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens. Three-year transition probabilities showed that only patients with a CD4 cell count ≥ 350 CD4/mm3 could in most cases maintain their immunity.

This paper aims to analyze the impact of various CO2 emission reduction policies combinations on the economic benefits and environmental changes of the steel industry and to determine the scope of application. Design/methodology/approach: To compare the impact and applicable implementation conditions, a production decision game model that incorporates these two policies has been constructed. Short-, medium- and long-term constraints are set on the emission reduction indicators and the indicators’ changes under various scenarios are compared. Findings: In the case of a single emission reduction policy, the carbon trading (CT) mechanism is better than the carbon tax mechanism. The mixed carbon trading mechanism is superior to the mixed carbon tax mechanism in terms of total output and subsidies, but worse in terms of overall social welfare, producer surplus and macro losses. Originality/value: This paper constructs multiple emission reduction and production backgrounds and discusses the impact of the comprehensive implementation of these policies, which is practically absent in previous studies.

      " Abstract: Reducing the uncertainties surrounding the impacts of anthropogenic climate change requires vetting general circulation models (GCMs) against long records of past natural climate variability. This is particularly challenging in the tropical Pacific Ocean, where short, sparse instrumental data preclude GCM validation on multidecadal to centennial time scales. This two-part paper demonstrates the application of two statistical methodologies to a network of accurately dated tropical climate records to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) variability in the Niño-3.4 region over the past millennium. While Part I described the methods and established their validity and limitations, this paper presents several reconstructions of Niño-3.4, analyzes their sensitivity to procedural choices and input data, and compares them to climate forcing time series and previously published tropical Pacific SST reconstructions. The reconstructions herein show remarkably similar behavior at decadal to multidecadal scales, but diverge markedly on centennial scales. The amplitude of centennial variability in each reconstruction scales with the magnitude of the A.D. 1860-1995 trend in the target dataset's Niño-3.4 index, with Extended Reconstructed SST, version 3 (ERSSTv3)>the Second Hadley Centre SST dataset (HadSST2)> Kaplan SST; these discrepancies constitute a major source of uncertainty in reconstructing preinstrumental Niño-3.4 SST. Despite inevitable variance losses, the reconstructed multidecadal variability exceeds that simulated by a state-of-the-art GCM (forced and unforced) over the past millennium, while reconstructed centennial variability is incompatible with constant boundary conditions. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals a robust antiphasing between solar forcing and Niño-3.4 SST on bicentennial time scales, but not on shorter time scales. Implications for GCM representations of the tropical Pacific climate response to radiative forcing are then discussed.© 2013 American Meteorological Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In electric power generation, customers want generators with high efficiency. Nowadays, modern turbo-generators have efficiencies greater than 98%. Although this amount should not be obtained for all kind of machines, efficiency will remain one of the main parameters for customer choice. Efficiency is also linked to the life of the machine: the higher the efficiency is, the longer the machine's lifetime. During the past decade, new forms of energy production have appeared and generators have been developed to fit well into this market. For example, wind generators evolved towards permanent magnet generators having high polarity and running at low speed. Nevertheless, their structure is not fixed. An industrial company has built a prototype of such a generator which uses fractional-slot concentrated-windings (FSCW). This kind of winding is not the structure used by default in such electrical machines. Another field of interest is in autonomous generators which can be used on boats. Even if everyone has in mind large merchant ships, we must not forget smaller ships, such as fishing boats and short-range cruise ships, which spend the most of their time near the coast. This kind of ship does nothave large areas for installing the electric generation or the electric propulsion. It is the reason why, in this article, we focus on the efficiency of machines using fractional-slot concentrated-windings. In many publications which compare performances between distributed and concentrated windings, the result is almost the same. The efficiency of FSCW is not as high as the efficiency associated to the machines which are using distributed windings. Design methods have to be redrawn to integrate, as soon as possible, the loss mitigation in order to provide the best efficiency in power conversion. The following discussion, step by step, introduces the loss mitigation in every part of a machine using FSCW. To close the discussion, a design is produced and it appears that efficiency can be enhanced with suitable design methods. © 2016 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Facilitated by recent advances using CRISPR/Cas9, genome editing technologies now permit custom genetic modifications in a wide variety of organisms. Ideally, modified animals could be both efficiently made and easily identified with minimal initial screening and without introducing exogenous sequence at the locus of interest or marker mutations elsewhere. To this end, we describe a coconversion strategy, using CRISPR/Cas9 in which screening for a dominant phenotypic oligonucleotide-templated conversion event at one locus can be used to enrich for custom modifications at another unlinked locus. After the desired mutation is identified among the F1 progeny heterozygous for the dominant marker mutation, F2 animals that have lost the marker mutation are picked to obtain the desired mutation in an unmarked genetic background. We have developed such a coconversion strategy for Caenorhabditis elegans, using a number of dominant phenotypic markers. Examining the coconversion at a second (unselected) locus of interest in the marked F1 animals, we observed that 14-84% of screened animals showed homologous recombination. By reconstituting the unmarked background through segregation of the dominant marker mutation at each step, we show that custom modification events can be carried out recursively, enabling multiple mutant animals to be made. While our initial choice of a coconversion marker [rol-6(su1006)] was readily applicable in a single round of coconversion, the genetic properties of this locus were not optimal in that CRISPR-mediated deletion mutations at the unselected rol-6 locus can render a fraction of coconverted strains recalcitrant to further rounds of similar mutagenesis. An optimal marker in this sense would provide phenotypic distinctions between the desired mutant/+ class and alternative +/+, mutant/null, null/null, and null/+ genotypes. Reviewing dominant alleles from classical C. elegans genetics, we identified one mutation in dpy-10 and one mutation in sqt-1 that meet these criteria and demonstrate that these too can be used as effective conversion markers. Coconversion was observed using a variety of donor molecules at the second (unselected) locus, including oligonucleotides, PCR products, and plasmids. We note that the coconversion approach described here could be applied in any of the variety of systems where suitable coconversion markers can be identified from previous intensive genetic analyses of gain-of-function alleles. © 2014 by the Genetics Society of America.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Sha Zhu Pan (杀猪盘), or Pig-Butchering scam, is a new online romance scam that mainly targets Chinese-speaking individuals to gain emotional trust and persuade victims to invest in a fictitious website controlled by the scammer group. The substantial economic loss forced the Chinese government to launch a series of judicial campaigns against this crime. Regardless, Sha Zhu Pan has not been significantly curbed but intensified and spread from mainland China to Southeast Asia, North America, and other regions. When procuring answers to this conundrum, no empirical studies have attempted to explore judicial aspects among Sha Zhu Pan cases in China. The purpose of this paper is to utilize focal concern theory, a conceptual framework generally applies to explain sentencing disparity, to explore whether the sentencing of Sha Zhu Pan offenders is guided by legal factors outlined in Chinese sentencing guidelines. To answer this question, this study quantitatively analyzes 172 legal cases collected from China Judgments Online. Although few inconsistent findings exist, the empirical evidence reveals that the judgments in Sha Zhu Pan cases are primarily driven by the three legal elements of the focal concern theory. The outcomes expand the focal concern theory to cybercrime sentencing in a cross-cultural context while offering insights to guide future research. © The Author(s) 2023.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Branch prediction structures are increasingly used in space processors due to their crucial role in improving processor performance. Due to radiation effects such as Single Event Upset (SEU) causing system failures, it is necessary to provide protection techniques for branch prediction modules against complex spatial environments. In this paper, we proposed a simple, efficient, low-power, and fault-tolerant design scheme for L0 BTB consisting of a master-slave and a check-decision module. The strategy sets up the L0 BTB structure as a master-slave structure and adds an error check to detect single-bit errors. Experimental results show that we achieve 100% fault tolerance without a loss hit rate. The increase in resource usage is 1.1x, and the path delay increases by 8.1%, superior to other methods. The L0 BTB is a fully-associative structure and multiple entries are accessed simultaneously, which introduces significant power consumption. We added a low-power design for the master-slave module to reduce the query power consumption by 65.9%. In addition, we also applied the scheme to the RAS module. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach is an efficient, generic, fault-tolerant design scheme that can be deployed to different register files.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric's test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Criminal behavior has been associated with abnormal neural activity when people experience risks and rewards or exercise inhibition. However, neural substrates of mental representations that underlie criminal and noncriminal risk-taking in adulthood have received scant attention. We take a new approach, applying fuzzy-trace theory, to examine neural substrates of risk preferences and criminality. We extend ideas about gist (simple meaning) and verbatim (precise risk-reward tradeoffs) representations used to explain adolescent risk-taking to uncover neural correlates of developmentally inappropriate adult risk-taking. We tested predictions using a risky-choice framing task completed in the MRI scanner, and examined neural covariation with self-reported criminal and noncriminal risk-taking. As predicted, risk-taking was correlated with a behavioral pattern of risk preferences called \"reverse framing\" (preferring sure losses over a risky option and a risky option over sure gains, the opposite of typical framing biases) that has been linked to risky behavior in adolescents and is rarely observed in nondisordered adults. Experimental manipulations confirmed processing interpretations of typical framing (gist-based) and reverse-framing (verbatim-based) risk preferences. In the brain, covariation with criminal and noncriminal risk-taking was observed predominantly when subjects made reverse-framing choices. Noncriminal risk-taking behavior was associated with emotional reactivity (amygdala) and reward motivation (striatal) areas, whereas criminal behavior was associated with greater activation in temporal and parietal cortices, their junction, and insula. When subjects made more developmentally typical framing choices, reflecting nonpreferred gist processing, activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex covaried with criminal risk-taking, which may reflect cognitive effort to process gist while inhibiting preferred verbatim processing. © 2018 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the UK, there has been growing concern about young people’s understanding of sexual consent, with the views of young people themselves often lost in academic and educational policy debates. However, the focus on high rates of sexual violence has meant a lack of attention on the everyday negotiation of consensual heterosexual activity, leading to assumptions being made regarding young people’s lack of understanding of sexual consent. This paper emerges from a wider study of over 500 young people which sought to uncover their understanding of the issues. Drawing on data from workshops and the open text responses to an on-line survey the findings presented in this paper show that the majority of heterosexual young people understood the complexity of sexual consent as an embodied process, which can be difficult to define, talk about or practice uniformly. This complex understanding, in which sexual consent is a continuum rather than a dichotomy, has implications for sexual education initiatives. We argue that it is only by providing a closer understanding of how–within consensual sexual activities–young people understand and enact sexual consent through a range of embodied communication strategies that education surrounding sexual assault will become meaningful. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Those with disabilities who have lost their legs must use a prosthesis to walk. However, traditional prostheses have the disadvantage of being unable to move and support the human gait because there are no mechanisms or algorithms to control them. This makes it difficult for the wearer to walk. To overcome this problem, we developed an insole device with a wearable sensor for real-time gait phase detection based on the kNN (k-nearest neighbor) algorithm for prosthetic control. The kNN algorithm is used with the raw data obtained from the pressure sensors in the insole to predict seven walking phases, i.e., stand, heel strike, foot flat, midstance, heel off, toe-off, and swing. As a result, the predictive decision in each gait cycle to control the ankle movement of the transtibial prosthesis improves with each walk. The results in this study can provide 81.43% accuracy for gait phase detection, and can control the transtibial prosthetic effectively at the maximum walking speed of 6 km/h. Moreover, this insole device is small, lightweight and unaffected by the physical factors of the wearer. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Key account sales are important for business organizations. Understanding why some of these sales proposals fail from the buyer's perspective has organization-wide implications for improving firm performance. Extant literature lacks a clear understanding of the process-based determinants of sales failure within a key account context. Another problem with this research stream is its reliance on data from the salesperson, sales manager, and/or selling firm, which can introduce attribution biases. Our research overcomes sales failure attribution biases by collecting data from the industrial buying center's perspective. Thirty-five semi-structured interview cases were conducted with buying decision makers following failed key account sales proposals. The result of this inquiry is a model which outlines the determinants of sales failures. We identify three common drivers of sales failure: adaptability, relationship-potential, and cost considerations. Results indicate that these established constructs are more complex than previously specified, each having multiple attributes as defined by key account buyers. © Published by Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Work-related head injury is a critical public health issue due to its rising prevalence; the association with profound disruption of workers' lives; and significant economic burdens in terms of medical costs and lost wages. Efforts to understand and prevent these types of injuries have largely been dominated by epidemiological research and safety science, which has focused on identifying risk at the level of the individual worker, population group, or organizational sector. Limited research has focused on the perspectives of the workers, a key stakeholder group for informing understanding of vulnerability to work-related head injury. This study explored workers' perspectives to better understand their decision-making and how and why their injuries occurred. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured interviews with thirty-two adult workers who had sustained a work-related head injury. Workers were recruited from an urban clinic in central Ontario, Canada. Labour Process Theory informed the thematic analysis. Results: Three hazardous work conditions were identified: insufficient training; inadequate staffing; and inattention to the physical environment. In addition, professional and organizational norms were implicated in vulnerability to head injury including putting the client before the worker and the pressure to work unsafely. The findings also highlight a complex interrelationship between workers' decision-making and professional and organizational norms that produces vulnerability to head injury, a vulnerability which oftentimes is reproduced by workers' decisions to work despite hazardous conditions. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that, beyond the need to redress the inattention to hazards in the physical environment, there is a need to address norms that influence worker decision-making to improve the safety of workers. Using Labour Process Theory highlights an important social dynamic within workplace sectors that could inform future development and implementation of multi-level and integrated public health strategies to reduce work-related head injury. © 2017 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We model Central American migrant-sending household agricultural practices given labor losses and the concomitant infusion of remittances. Under the new economics of labor migration (NELM) framework, it is hypothesized that smallholder farm households invest remittance income in their land either to increase crop production or to transition to cattle ranching. We test this hypothesis by developing a combination of multivariate logistic, Poisson and beta regression techniques using Latin American Migration Project data to determine how agricultural land use change compared among migrant and non-migrant households in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. Results indicate that a rise in months spent abroad and remittances returned do not translate into a higher percentage of farm sales, intensification or transition to cattle ranching - counter to NELM. However, farmers are investing remittances to increase row crop and pasture land holdings. These findings suggest remittance investments in quantitative increase rather than qualitative change in land use practices. Given the expansive land demands supporting low intensity smallholder agriculture and cattle, and the land degradation cattle precipitate particularly, the trend does not augur well for the sustainability of rural landscapes increasingly transformed by international remittances. Appropriate policies to champion coupled human-land system sustainability in Central America might usefully consider viable land use alternatives to remittance investments dedicated to crop and pasture expansion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Moral hazards are said to occur when one party makes decisions that have potential negative consequences that will either be fully or partially experienced by another party. The present experiment sought to explore moral hazard in a laboratory setting. Participants made choices between certain and risky rewards. On some trials, participants bore the full brunt of a loss if the risky reward was chosen and lost. On other trials, participants believed losses would be shared with another party creating the opportunity for moral hazard. Our design allowed us to measure whether the presence of a moral hazard influenced participants' choice behavior and to quantify the magnitude of this influence. Results suggested that participants were more tolerant of risk when they believed losses would be shared with another party compared to choices when all of the loss would be experienced personally. More importantly, concern for the third party losses appeared to exert no influence on choices whatsoever. These results were found when the third party was anonymous (Experiment 1) but also when they met the third party face-to-face (Experiment 2).

      " Abstract: Any product outsourcing expands the geological boundaries of production industries under the global supply chain management. The global outsourcing increases concerns for production industries, which is less for domestic supply chain management. Two main strategy makings for product outsourcing under the global supply chain are the proper information about products and services for those products. This study examines a service-driven digital global supply chain management to find intriguing factors for product outsourcing decision-making with international tax, dollar rate, and tariff. The flexible production & the production–transportation lead time of manufacturers and two-stage safety factors of retailers are features of the digital global supply chain. Manufacturers develop a new investment strategy on radio frequency identification technology for product information sharing with retailers. Both manufacturers and retailers pay carbon tax for all products along with transportation for the environmental development. A classical optimization technique finds the global optimum profit of the global supply chain management. Numerical results establish service and safety stock of products as two decision-making factors for digital global supply chain management. The profit is high when retailers are situated in a low-economy country with high service. Retailers in a high-economy country with no service cause a 57.98% loss than the original profit.

      " Abstract: Introduction: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use has been increasing in the past decades in tandem with changes regarding the notions of health and illness. Comparing conventional medicine (CM) and CAM in how they address health problems has been a point of focus for both the health sciences and individuals dealing with health problems. Various social, cultural, political, economic, and personal factors play a role in whether different health approaches are integrated or not when addressing illness experiences. Methods: The qualitative study comprised semistructured interviews (N = 9) and participant observation involving 105 patients conducted between January 2015 and May 2017 at 4 clinics of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Budapest, Hungary. Code structures were created inductively with Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results: The mutually exclusive view of CM/CAM use occurred due to loss of trust in the doctor-patient relationship causing problems in communication, and also as a result of the patient espousing certain cultural dispositions. Significant dispositions included a preference for the “natural” and psychologization, the latter often manifested in psychosocial etiology, vitalism, and illness symbolism. Discussion: A polarized choice of therapy may occur as a result of a competitive health care market in which medical modalities and their underlying cultural systems compete within a global milieu of information proliferation and a hybridization of individual worldviews. Through a process of “cultural creolization”, changing concepts of health and illness create varying patient expectations and meanings regarding illness, which in turn affect therapy choice as well. Conclusion: Mirrored in the articulation of an individual’s illness trajectory is a tension that is also reflected in the struggles in the health care system to more adequately understand health/illness processes from a pluralistic perspective. The power relations in the health arena (among CAM/CM practitioners and systems) play a role in legitimizing or undermining different health practices, which as consequence affects the possibility of integrating them into the processes of care. Thus, therapy choice is not only linked to changing notions of health and illness, but also to shifting conceptualizations of self, identity, and the practitioner-patient relationship. © The Author(s) 2018.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Land use has significantly changed during the recent decades at global and local scale, while the importance of ecosystems as sources/sinks of C has been highlighted, emphasizing the global impact of land use changes. Land use changes can increase C loss rates which are extremely difficult to reverse, in the short term, opposite to organic carbon (OC) which accumulates in soil in the long-term. The aim of this research is to improve and test methodologies to assess land cover change (LCC) dynamics and temporal and spatial variability in C stored in vegetation at a wide scale. LCCs between 1956 and 2007 in Andalusia (Southern Spain) were selected for this pilot study, assessed by comparison of spatial data from 1956 to 2007 and were reclassified following land cover flows (LCFs) reported in major areas in Europe. Carbon vegetation densities were related to land cover, and C vegetation stocks for 1956 and 2007 were calculated by multiplying C density for each land cover class with land cover areas. The study area has supported important changes during the studied period with significant consequences for vegetation C stocks, mainly due to afforestation and intensification of agriculture, resulting in a total vegetation C stock of 156.08. Tg in 2007, with an increase of 17.24. Tg since 1956. This study demonstrates the importance of LCC for C sequestration in vegetation from Mediterranean areas, highlighting possible directions for management policies in order to mitigate climate change as well as promoting land conservation.

      " Abstract: The utilization of small and medium magnitudes of floodwater has remarkable benefits when the supply of conventional water is scarce relative to demand. Conceptually correct and empirically accurate estimates of the benefits of floodwater utilization are essential for rational replenishment of scarce water in the fields of agriculture, industry, households, recreation and so on. This article raises several issues that should be considered in deriving sound evaluation of benefits of floodwater utilization. These include: (i) identifying and defining benefit categories according to flood loss analysis; (ii) establishing a universal benefits indices system and choosing the variable fuzzy pattern recognition model to evaluate the system; (iii) illustrating the benefits of floodwater utilization based on the floodwater utilization practices in the Baicheng Region of northeastern China. An integrated floodwater utilization benefits research framework suggests that a combination of direct economic benefit, eco-environmental benefit and social benefit can provide complementary insights into sustainable water utilization.

      " Abstract: Faults during a wastewater treatment for plant (WWTP) are critical issue for social and biological. Poorly treated wastewater may achieve dangerous effect for human as well as nature. This paper proposed a novel model based on a binary version of whale optimization algorithm (WOA), chaos theory and fuzzy logic, namely (CF-BWOA). CF-BWOA is applied in the application of WWTP to find out the more relevant attributes from the whole dataset, reducing cost and validation of decision rules, and helping to identify a non-well-structured domain. CF-BWOA attempts to reduce the whole feature set without loss of significant information to the classification process. Fast fuzzy c-means is used as a cost function to measure the fuzzification and uncertainty of data. Ten different chaos sequence maps are used to estimate and tune WOA parameters. Experiments are applied on a complex real-time dataset with various uncertainty features and missing values. The overall result indicates that the CWOA with the Sine chaos map shows the better performance, lower error, higher convergence speed and shorter execution time. In addition, the proposed model is capable of detecting sensor process faults in WWTP with high accuracy and can guide the operators of these systems to control decisions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The idea of using industrial, agrarian, domestic, construction and demolition wastes as sustainable binders substituting Portland cement in stabilization of soils is considered a modern-day concept. The choice of which residues to be used in each specific earthwork is not a simple one, as it largely depends on the distance between where wastes are generated and where they could be used. Material transportation costs may be economically infeasible if the distance is too long. Current research evaluates the potential of pozzolanic wastes studied herein (coal bottom ash - BA, rice husk ash - RHA, ground glass - GG, ground clay brick - GCB), and carbide lime (CL), as possible hydraulic cements (substituting Portland cement) to enhance behaviour of poorly graded sand. Such blends, when compacted, have potential application in construction of stabilized rammed walls, as well as beds of pipelines and spread footings, and as base/subbase of pavements. Pozzolanic reactions occur between silica/alumina in amorphous phases (found in pozzolanic wastes) and Ca++ (existent in CL) in alkaline environments. The amount and type of pozzolan used, the carbide lime content, and the blend porosity affect the loss of mass, stiffness, and strength of compacted sand-pozzolan-CL mixtures. Outcomes have revealed typical normalized tendencies among accumulated loss of mass (ALM) – porosity/binder index (η/Biv), initial shear modulus (G0) – η/Biv and unconfined compressive strength (qu) – η/Biv for the blends, even though each pozzolan has its own distinct characteristics. From a practicing viewpoint, moulding a sand specimen containing given pozzolan and lime amounts, a specific porosity, and cured for a particular time, allows the determination of the curve in which η/Biv controls ALM, G0 and qu for a complete range of porosities and pozzolan and lime contents. Such findings contribute in reducing the quantity of specimens required to be moulded and tested, diminishing earthwork design costs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The Brexit referendum confronted British voters with a choice that could have profound consequences for the British economy in a context of high uncertainty. Drawing on important lessons from prospect theory, I argue that citizens who were in the domain of economic losses were more likely to take a risk and vote in favor of Brexit. On the contrary, I hold that citizens who were in the domain of economic gains tended to be more risk averse and were more likely to support ‘Remain’ in the referendum. Using data from several waves of the British Election Study 2014–2019 Internet Panel, I find strong support for these theoretical expectations. British voters who lived in declining areas were significantly more likely to think that leaving the EU would lead to improvements in the national economy. These prospective economic evaluations (captured about a month prior to the referendum) in turn are related to the ‘Leave’ vote in the Brexit referendum. © 2019\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This study aims to develop an innovative approach based on a wearable inertial system, which enables objective evaluations on the of loss of ground contact in race-walking, in order to assist coaching and judging. The architecture of the system, its positioning on the human body and functional requirements were defined through a Kansei Engineering approach by using a significant sample of athletes, coaches and judges within the race-walking environment. The analysis of variance supports decisions concerning the optimal system architecture consisting of an inertial sensor positioned on the centre-of-mass of the subject and a control unit. The selected device was then validated in laboratory conditions by means of an integrated system, including dynamic (680 Hz) and kinematic (340 Hz) devices, which are more accurate than the inertial system (200 Hz). The experiment was carried out at the Fraunhofer JL IDEAS-MISEF at CESMA, Laboratory of Advanced Measures on Ergonomics and Shapes of the University of Naples Federico II where four elite race walkers performed 60 test-runs according to a well-defined experimental protocol. Results proved that the inertial system could improve the accuracy in detecting illegal steps. Through statistical classification, it was found that the proposed approach has achieved encouraging results in comparison with state of the art approaches and could be a good architecture to develop a valuable tool to assist experts. © 2016, Springer-Verlag France.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the literature, extensions of common fuzzy sets have been proposed one after another. The recent addition is spherical fuzzy sets theory, which is based on three independent membership parameters established on a unit sphere with a restriction linked to their squared summation. This article uses the new extension that presents bigger domains for each parameter for production design. A systematic approach for determining customer demands or requirements, Quality Function Deployment (QFD) converts them into the final production to fulfill these demands in a decision-making environment. In order to prevent information loss during the decision-making process, it offers a useful technique to describe the linguistic analysis in terms of 2-tuples. This research introduces a novel decision-making method utilizing the 2-tuple linguistic T-spherical fuzzy numbers (2TLT-SFNs) in order to select the best alternative to manufacturing a linear delta robot. Taking into account the interaction between the attributes, we develop the 2TLT-SF Hamacher (2TLT-SFH) operators by using innovative operational rules. These operators include the 2TLT-SFH weighted average (2TLT-SFHWA) operator, 2TLT-SFH ordered weighted average (2TLT-SFHOWA) operator, 2TLT-SFH hybrid average (2TLT-SFHHA) operator, 2TLT-SFH weighted geometric (2TLT-SFHWG) operator, 2TLT-SFH ordered weighted geometric (2TLT-SFHOWG) operator, and 2TLT-SFH hybrid geometric (2TLT-SFHHG) operator. In addition, we discuss the properties of 2TLT-SFH operators such as idempotency, boundedness, and monotonicity. We develop a novel approach according to the CODAS (Combinative Distance-based Assessment) model in order to deal with the problems of the 2TLT-SF multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) environment. Finally, to validate the feasibility of the given strategy, we employ a quantitative example to select the best alternative to manufacture a linear delta robot. The suggested information-based decision-making methodology which is more extensively adaptable than existing techniques prevents the risk of data loss and makes rational decisions. © 2023 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Monitoring of microemulsion ciclosporin (cyclosporine; Neoral®) by 2-hour post-dose drug concentrations (C2) is an accurate measure of ciclosporin absorption efficiency and exposure, and appears superior to trough (C0) monitoring for prediction of rejection risk. A predictive decision model was used to determine if this approach also reduces total treatment costs in the first 12 months after renal transplantation. Methods: Parameter estimates for key clinical events were derived from the literature and from prospective pharmacokinetic studies comprising 234 adult HLA-non-identical renal graft recipients at seven Canadian centres. Patients were treated with microemulsion ciclosporin (Neoral®), corticosteroids and azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Using the perspective of the Canadian healthcare provider, total treatment costs for the C2 versus the C0 strategy were modelled over 12 months, and then remodelled using conservative estimates to extend the timeframe to 5 years. Health resources were valued in 1999 Canadian dollars. Results: The incidence of acute rejection was estimated to be 25% at 1 year in patients monitored by C0 and 18% in those monitored by C2. Patient survival was considered to be independent of monitoring strategy, and graft loss was predicted to be 1.4% lower in the C2 group. The studies suggested no important differences in comorbidity and the costs of C0 and C2 monitoring and ambulatory-based adverse events were held equivalent. Using these inputs, the average cost per patient for the first year post-transplant was $Can46 857 for C0 monitoring and $Can45 306 for C2 monitoring, rising to $Can146 879 and $Can142 569 after 5 years. The predicted cost for initial hospitalisation was $Can11 280 for C 0 and $Can10 806 for C2 monitoring. The cost of maintenance immunosuppressive drug use, graft loss and dialysis was $Can19 098 in the C0 group and $Can18 612 in the C 2 group, while acute rejection treatment costs were $Can2169 and $Can1577, respectively. An additional $Can14 310 was consumed by other events, including repeat hospitalisation, for each group. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the most influential parameters affecting savings due to C2 monitoring were a reduction in the duration of initial and follow-up hospitalisations and reduced risks of acute rejection and subsequent graft loss. Conclusions: Compared with traditional trough concentration monitoring, ciclosporin monitoring at 2 hours post-dose produced a predicted saving of $Can1551 during the first year after renal transplant. Although modelling assumptions become more restrictive over time, this projection allows a preliminary assessment of the long-term economic impact of the routine use of C2 monitoring.\u001b[0m :\n",

Using spatially explicit sea-level estimates for the next 2000 years and high-resolution topography data, we compute which current cultural heritage sites will be affected by sea-level rise at different levels of sustained future warming. As indicators for the pressure on future cultural heritage we estimate the percentage of each country's area loss, and the percentage of current population living in regions that will be permanently below sea level, for different temperature levels. If the current global mean temperature was sustained for the next two millennia, about 6% (40 sites) of the UNESCO sites will be affected, and 0.7% of global land area will be below mean sea level. These numbers increase to 19% (136 sites) and 1.1% for a warming of 3 K. At this warming level, 3-12 countries will experience a loss of more than half of their current land surface, 25-36 countries lose at least 10% of their territory, and 7% of the global population currently lives in regions that will be below local sea level.

      " Abstract: Objective: Determine cost differences between cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and serum integrated screening (INT) in obese women given the limitations of aneuploidy screening in this population. Methods: Using a decision-analytic model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of trisomy 21 screening in class III obese women using cfDNA compared with INT. Primary outcomes of the model were cost, number of unnecessary invasive tests, procedure-related fetal losses, and missed cases of trisomy 21. Results: In base case, the mean cost of cfDNA was $498 greater than INT ($1399 vs $901). cfDNA resulted in lower probabilities of unnecessary invasive testing (2.9% vs 3.5%), procedure-related loss (0.015% vs 0.019%), and missed cases of T21 (0.00013% vs 0.02%). cfDNA cost $87 485 per unnecessary invasive test avoided, $11 million per procedure-related fetal loss avoided, and $2.2 million per missed case of T21 avoided. In sensitivity analysis, when the probability of insufficient fetal fraction is assumed to be >25%, cfDNA is both costlier than INT and results in more unnecessary invasive testing (a dominated strategy). Conclusion: When the probability of insufficient fetal fraction more than 25% (a maternal weight of ≥300 lbs), cfDNA is costlier and results in more unnecessary invasive testing than INT. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Decision-making deficits in clinical populations are often assessed with the Iowa gambling task (IGT). Performance on this task is driven by latent psychological processes, the assessment of which requires an analysis using cognitive models. Two popular examples of such models are the Expectancy Valence (EV) and Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) models. These models have recently been subjected to sophisticated procedures of model checking, spawning a hybrid version of the EV and PVL models-the PVL-Delta model. In order to test the validity of the PVL-Delta model we present a parameter space partitioning (PSP) study and a test of selective influence. The PSP study allows one to assess the choice patterns that the PVL-Delta model generates across its entire parameter space. The PSP study revealed that the model accounts for empirical choice patterns featuring a preference for the good decks or the decks with infrequent losses; however, the model fails to account for empirical choice patterns featuring a preference for the bad decks. The test of selective influence investigates the effectiveness of experimental manipulations designed to target only a single model parameter. This test showed that the manipulations were successful for all but one parameter. To conclude, despite a few shortcomings, the PVL-Delta model seems to be a better IGT model than the popular EV and PVL models. © 2013 Steingroever, Wetzels and Wagenmakers.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, while the societal need for such policies is high, demand for natural disaster insurance typically is still low. While there is ample research on positive adoption decisions, reasons for non-adoption has not yet received the attention it deserves. Using the case of earthquake insurance in Turkey, this study investigates how public policy makers and insurance companies can differentiate non-adopter segments and consequently develop targeted strategies to stimulate the uptake of disaster insurance. Our study develops a non-adopter typology consisting of four segments—state reliant positivist, dependers, adversaries, and uninformed loners.

It was previously reported that Runx3 is strongly expressed in embryonic and adult gastrointestinal tract (GIT) epithelium (Ep) and that its loss causes gastric cancer. More than 280 publications have based their research on these findings and concluded that Runx3 is indeed a tumour suppressor (TS). In stark contrast, using various measures, we found that Runx3 expression is undetectable in GIT Ep. Employing a variety of biochemical and genetic techniques, including analysis of Runx3-GFP and R26LacZ/Runx3 Cre or R26tdTomato/Runx3 Cre reporter strains, we readily detected Runx3 in GIT-embedded leukocytes, dorsal root ganglia, skeletal elements and hair follicles. However, none of these approaches revealed detectable Runx3 levels in GIT Ep. Moreover, our analysis of the original Runx3 LacZ/LacZ mice used in the previously reported study failed to reproduce the GIT expression of Runx3. The lack of evidence for Runx3 expression in normal GIT Ep creates a serious challenge to the published data and undermines the notion that Runx3 is a TS involved in cancer pathogenesis. © 2011 EMBO Molecular Medicine.\u001b[0m :\n",

Individual driving behavior is represented by a prospect-theory-based model that takes into account uncertainty and risk evaluation in terms of gains and losses while following a lead vehicle. Given a set of stimuli (i.e., headways, relative speeds, etc.), the stochastic acceleration model generates acceleration probability distribution functions rather than deterministic acceleration values. Such distribution functions may be associated with travel time reliability through the construction of travel time distributions. In addition, lane-changing decision is represented by a stochastic hazard-based duration model that accounts for the surrounding traffic conditions (i.e., traffic density, distance to ramp, etc.). Numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed microscopic stochastic modeling approach produces realistic macroscopic traffic flow patterns and can be used to generate travel time distributions. With proper experimental setup and sensitivity analysis, travel time distributions may be estimated and linked to safety-based parameters. © 2014 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

We included all DIPP cases performed between 11 and 24 weeks of gestation. We compared the different types of DIPP performed in our hospital. Results: Two thousand one hundred eighty-five procedures were performed (1853 amniocenteses, 326 chorionic villus sampling, and 6 cordocenteses). The main indication for performing invasive procedures was abnormal results of aneuploidy screening for trisomy 21, followed by maternal age, and fetal structural abnormality. The fetal karyotype was altered in 154 (26.1%) cases. Trisomy 21 was the most common aneuploidy followed by trisomy 18, monosomy X, and trisomy 13.

The presented model provides theoretical support for combat decision-making in complex battlefield environments with uncertain information. The model employs single-valued neutrosophic sets to handle uncertain data, which enhances the descriptive ability of information. The maximum deviation method is used to calculate attribute weight factors, which highlights the importance of each attribute. The final target threat ranking is obtained based on the relative closeness coefficient of each target. Furthermore, the proposed model constructs a multi-attribute aggregation loss function matrix for each target, sets the risk avoidance coefficient under the knowledge of the battlefield condition, and calculates the decision threshold of each target using three-way decision theory. This method produces the classification of the target choice. The numerical examples and comparison analysis demonstrate that the suggested model can handle ambiguous scenario information effectively and reasonably, transform traditional decision-making ranking results into three-way classification findings, and provide a rationale for choosing an attacking target.  © 2023 - IOS Press.

This article describes a case of pediatric thoracic disk herniation with paraparesis treated surgically. A 14-year-old girl presented with a 4-month history of diffuse back pain and sudden onset paraparesis. Motor strength was 4/5 in both legs, and she had lost the ability to ambulate. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed spinal cord compression due to a herniated intervertebral disk at T5-T6. Computed tomography scan after myelogram demonstrated anterior dural sac compression at T5-T6 but no intervertebral disk calcification. She underwent transthoracic microdiskectomy. The herniated disk was removed, and the thoracic spinal cord was decompressed. No fusion was performed after microdiskectomy. The postoperative course was uncomplicated, and neurologic deficit resolved within 2 weeks postoperatively. The patient was pain free with no neurologic deficit at 24-month follow-up, and computed tomography scan showed remodeling of the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies. Most cases of thoracic disk herniation are asymptomatic. If no compression of the spinal cord exists, the natural history of the disease justifies conservative management. Although the treatment of choice is conservative, surgery is required in patients who develop progressive neurologic deficit or severe radicular pain.

      " Abstract: The Athabasca River Basin, home to Canada's growing oil sands mining industry, faces challenging trade-offs between energy production and water security. Water demand from the oil sands mining industry is projected to increase as climate change is projected to alter the seasonal freshwater supply. In this study, a range of water management options are developed to investigate the potential trade-offs between the scale of bitumen production and industry growth, water storage requirements, and environmental protection for the aquatic ecosystems, under projections of mid-century climate change. It is projected that water storage will be required to supplement river withdrawals to maintain continuous bitumen production under the impacts of future climate warming. If high growth in future bitumen production and water demand is the priority, then building sufficient water storage capacity to meet industry demand will be comparable to a week of lost revenue because of interrupted production. If environmental protection is prioritized instead, it will require over nine times the water storage costs to maintain water demand under a high industry growth trajectory. Future water use decisions will need to first, determine the scale of industry and environmental protection, and second, balance the costs of water storage against lost revenue because of water shortages that limit bitumen production. This physically based assessment of future water trade-offs can inform water policy, water management decisions, and climate change adaptation plans, with applicability to other regions facing trade-offs between industrial development and ecosystem water needs.

      " Abstract: Inadequate information used to support decision making in public health and health services is remarkable. The objective of this paper was to provide a synthesis of some of its causes and effects. Many studies show that two of the main limitations that affect the decision making are low quality and inadequacy of available scientific information. The latter consists of deficient reporting of study results. It encompasses manipulation of primary and secondary variables, abuse of surrogate and composite variables, intentional omission of outcome reporting and publication biases. The lower the value of available information for decision making, the higher the opportunity cost of decisions. This cost can be translated into health benefits lost due to delayed adoption of potentially effective and efficient interventions and medical technologies, or adverse health effects and inefficiencies due to their early diffusion in the absence of sufficient scientific evidence of their efficacy, effectiveness or efficiency. Main solutions put forward are regulatory science measures, public registry of interventions in public health and clinical trials, use of estimation and Bayesian statistics instead of hypothesis testing, and declaration of conflicts of interests. Policy makers, public health professionals and clinicians should neither spare effort nor further delay the implementation and consolidation of these long known measures intended to minimize those limitations. Legitimacy and the level of scientific evidence of decision making will eventually depend on the effectiveness of those solutions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: A break in skin integrity must be repaired as quickly as possible to avoid excess blood and fluid loss, and to minimise the onset of infection. Hard-to-heal wounds, in which the progression of the wound healing response is compromised, present several challenges to healing (for example, the presence of devitalised tissue acting as a physical barrier to healing and as a focus for bacterial contamination with the potential for subsequent infection). The objective of this article is to present, as a narrative review, the clinical evidence supporting the use of a unique hydro-responsive wound dressing (HydroClean, HRWD1, PAUL HARTMANN AG, Germany). The dressing provides a simple treatment option to address a number of clinical challenges clinicians must overcome in order to facilitate wound healing progression. These studies demonstrated that this product supported successful debridement/cleansing of a wide variety of wounds, including hard-to-heal wounds, enabled wound bed preparation, and lead to positive healing outcomes, including in wounds that previously had failed to heal. The simplicity of using HRWD1 as a single dressing can help clinicians overcome a variety of challenges when treating both acute and hard-to-heal wounds, which, with the benefit of proven patient outcomes, could make it an ideal choice for a first-line treatment. © 2021 MA Healthcare Ltd.

      " Abstract: There is no accepted way of measuring prothrombin time without time loss for patients undergoing major surgery who are at risk of intraoperative dilution and consumption coagulopathy due to bleeding and volume replacement with crystalloids or colloids. Decisions to transfuse fresh frozen plasma and procoagulatory drugs have to rely on clinical judgment in these situations. Point-of-care devices are considerably faster than the standard laboratory methods. In this study we assessed the accuracy of a Point-of-care (PoC) device measuring prothrombin time compared to the standard laboratory method. Patients undergoing major surgery and intensive care unit patients were included. PoC prothrombin time was measured by CoaguChek® XS Plus (Roche Diagnostics, Switzerland). PoC and reference tests were performed independently and interpreted under blinded conditions. Using a cut-off prothrombin time of 50%, we calculated diagnostic accuracy measures, plotted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and tested for equivalence between the two methods. PoC sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI 77%, 100%) and 95% (95% CI 91%, 98%) respectively. The negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.32). The positive likelihood ratio was 19.57 (95% CI 10.62, 36.06). The area under the ROC curve was 0.988. Equivalence between the two methods was confirmed. CoaguChek® XS Plus is a rapid and highly accurate test compared with the reference test. These findings suggest that PoC testing will be useful for monitoring intraoperative prothrombin time when coagulopathy is suspected.

      " Abstract: Guiding patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) toward the most appropriate bariatric and metabolic procedure is crucial for improving outcomes. In recent years, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) have been the most commonly performed bariatric procedures worldwide. Both are safe, effective, and durable metabolic procedures. The aim of this review was to critically examine the best available evidence derived from the randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to identify which bariatric procedure is superior in an individual with T2D to provide sustainable long-term remission. There are 4 RCTs in patients with T2D that directly compare RYGB with SG, report outcomes up to 5 years after randomization, and provide level I evidence for procedure selection. While the remission rate of T2D after RYGB versus SG is comparable in all 4 RCTs, all studies are underpowered to reveal differences in T2D-related endpoints between these 2 procedures. Combined analysis of RCTs (RYGB, n = 176 versus SG, n = 175) would indicate that either there is no significant long-term difference between RYGB and SG in improving T2D, or in case of a true difference (and we still do not have enough statistical power to reveal the difference), that difference would be <15% favoring RYGB. Prediction tools, such as the individualized metabolic surgery score, can identify patients who can benefit the most from the antidiabetic effects of RYGB. Nonetheless, the procedure selection should not be solely based on T2D-related outcomes. Diabetes is one outcome; one of many outcomes that needs to be considered in decision-making. Patient's conditions and clinical outcomes that are critical in choosing the most optimal bariatric and metabolic procedure will also be explained in this review. © 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Congress has historically delegated authority to \"angels\" to accomplish ends the Congress could not. An increasingly popular form of congressional delegation has been to entrust temporary, independent advisory bodies to render nonpartisan recommendations and advice. Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain what motivates Congress to delegate, and few of these focus on delegation to ad hoc commissions. Most portray delegation as an advantageous way for legislators to favor constituents or shift blame in order to maximize benefits and minimize losses. Others hypothesize that desired outcomes can be achieved only by delegating authority to someone else. This perspective outlines the need to delegate as a principal- agent issue, suggesting that notable benefits, like collective action, are realized through organizations. While each perspective provides some clues as to why Congress will cede authority over policy making to an ad hoc commission, neither fully captures every decision to delegate. However, according to the architects of commissions, not every commission is created with the expectation of doing what members want to avoid or want to do but not openly. The varied reasons suggested in interviews and the resulting commissions may be classified in three basic categories: to take advantage of expertise that is unavailable through standard institutional resources or prohibitively costly to obtain; to shift the blame for unpopular decisions; and, a third factor which does not appear in existing literature, to keep legislators' workloads manageable. © 1998 American University, Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Statement of problem. Crowns have been considered the restoration of choice for endodontically treated teeth, but their selection has been based primarily on anecdotal evidence. Purpose. This study tested the hypothesis that crown placement (coronal coverage) is associated with improved survival of endodontically treated teeth when preaccess, endodontic, and restorative factors are controlled. Material and methods. A University of Iowa College of Dentistry treatment database was used to identify permanent teeth that had undergone initial obturation between July 1, 1985, and December 31, 1987. Study patients were restricted to persons with at least 1 dental visit in each 2-year interval from 1985 to 1996; a simple random sample of 280 patients (n = 400 teeth) was selected. Dental charts, radiographs, and computerized databases were examined to ascertain variables of interest and to verify study inclusion criteria. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were generated for the 203 teeth that satisfied study inclusion criteria. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were developed, with standard errors adjusted to account for clustering of teeth within patients. Results. When tooth type and radiographic evidence of caries at access were controlled, the final Cox model showed that endodontically treated teeth not crowned after obturation were lost at a 6.0 times greater rate than teeth crowned after obturation (95% confidence interval: 3.2 to 11.3). Conclusion. Within the limitations of this study, a strong association between crown placement and the survival of endodontically treated teeth was observed. These results may impact treatment planning if long-term tooth retention is the primary goal. Copyright © 2002 by The Editorial Council of The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This article provides an evaluation of the commercial viability of the suborbital tourism market while considering the large uncertainties in the current demand predictions. Since it is unlikely that future demand forecasts will be significantly more precise, an analysis that takes these uncertainties into account is needed. Our study addresses this problem by using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the distribution of possible results in commercial terms (net present value [NPV] developed from a discounted cash flow analysis). By conducting a sensitivity analysis, we identify the most impactful factors in development and create a probability distribution of their uncertainties. Previous work done by the authors defined a design space of 33 suborbital vehicle architecture from which we picked for the purpose of this article optimal architecture number 4 with 1 pilot (this is the same architecture as XCOR's Lynx). Data from studies are used to model the distribution of the demand and its uncertainty. The cost model is mainly based on cost estimation relationships from one study. We implement several decision rules to simulate 5 different commercial strategies a company in this sector might have. We found that there are 2 dominant commercial strategies: a riskier strategy with an aggressive fleet expansion with a large vehicle (16 participants, average expected NPV is $2.8 billion, 41% chance of incurring losses) and a less risky strategy with a neutral fleet expansion and a medium vehicle (4 participants, average expected NPV is $2 billion, 33% chance of incurring losses). We conclude that the suborbital tourism market can probably be made commercially attractive by proper management of development, even in the face of significant uncertainty. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Microdialysis has been the standard technique of choice at the Department of Plastic Surgery, Aarhus University Hospital, since September 1998. In this study we present our experience of monitoring 78 intraoral free flaps. It is a retrospective evaluation of patients' casenotes from November 1998 to March 2008. Sixty-five of the 78 flaps healed without complications. Sixty-one of these showed no sign of ischaemia in the microdialysis values; in 4 cases the microdialysis system caused technical problems. Thirteen patients were reoperated on based on the results of microdialysis analysis, and in all but 2 cases critical ischaemia was found. Ten of the 11 critically ischaemic flaps were saved. The overall loss rate of flaps was 1.3%. The 2 flaps that were reoperated on but no critical ischaemia found were 2 fibular flaps during the time that we were learning how to monitor with microdialysis (1999 and 2000). Since then we have developed a decision algorithm for standard monitoring, and since 2000 we have had no false positive results. We have never lost a flap from neglected ischaemia.

In doing so, 162 respondents were selected using a convenience sampling method, and they responded to the modified version of RCOPE.

      " Abstract: Machine learning and knowledge representation are two fields of artificial intelligence that lead with intelligent reasoning, each one differently. When Know-ledge Representation (KR) focuses more on the epistemological face of knowledge to carry out a power-expression model with detriment of the computation efficiency. Machine learning pays more attention to the computation efficiency, often with loss of expressing power. In this paper we show that features of one may overwhelm drawbacks of the other. Taking the uncertainty artefact from machine learning and symbolic representation from KR, we propose in this paper a new memory modelling for knowledge based systems which is at the same time machine-learning structure and a knowledge representation model, In terms of machine learning, our structure allows an unlimited flexibility where no restraining architecture is imposed at the beginning (think about decision trees [18, 6, 5, 2]). Classification can be performed with incomplete vectors where the most likely corresponding class is assigned to the vector with missing attributes. Viewed as a knowledge model, a basic knowledge is easily specified graphically. Inference is defined by rules expressed in the same manner, where the existing sub-instances are used to generate new connections and entities. Inference on existing knowledge is described in two algorithms. Our approach is mainly based on the representation of the context concept. Our model brings together advantages of the symbolic knowledge representation, namely human to computer knowledge coding, and those of machine learning structures, namely ease of efficient coding of inference to perform the so-called intelligent tasks like pattern recognition, prediction and others. Its graphical representation allows visualization of both dynamic and static sides of the model (i.e. inference and knowledge).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Classical fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) schemes are based on reconstructions from three consecutive second-order polynomials. They give a third-order accurate scheme when two consecutive polynomials are smooth and one is non-smooth. This situation means losing one order of accuracy if compared with a fourth-order scheme. In classical WENO schemes, weighting functions that determine the weights for the polynomials and that eventually define the reconstruction are directly related to a smoothness indicator. This property may lead to a non-zero residual of a very small value in the Taylor expansion. To handle this situation a weighting procedure that does not directly rely on the smoothness indicator is presented. Once the smooth polynomials are determined, the smoothness indicator has no role in the further steps, which are taken care of by a new switch function. Contrary to other approaches this switch function does not involve any conditional statements. A tuning parameter is also included so that the resulting order-adaptive property can be adjusted to specific requirements. The performance of the resulting schemes for cell-average and point-value reconstructions is studied. In addition, the effect of the choice of numerical flux or Riemann solver on these reconstruction strategies is analysed. Numerical tests for the Euler equations of gas dynamics in one and two space dimensions are presented. Improvements in resolution and the stability are found when compared with the conventional WENO techniques. © 2021 The Author(s)\u001b[0m :\n",

The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the expression of these biomarkers in primary breast cancer and in its metachronous recurrences or metastases, and to estimate the percentage of cases with discordant expression. Methods: Paired primary and metastatic tumor samples were collected from patients with primary breast cancer and subsequent metachronous distant metastases, diagnosed at the Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Piraeus, Greece, from 1988 to 2008. Two cases of local recurrence were also included. ER, PR and HER2 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) according to ASCO-CAP 2007 guidelines.

In the primary tumor, ER, PR and HER2 were positively expressed in 64.5%, 58.2% and 32.7% of cases, respectively, and expression of these biomarkers was lost in 18.2%, 21.8% and 10.9% of the corresponding metastases, respectively. Overall, a change of ER, PR and HER2 expression from positive to negative and vice versa occurred in 27.3% (p = 0.0987), 25.5% (p < 0.001) and 18.2% (p = 0.5034) of the cases, respectively. Conclusion: The expression of ER, PR and HER2 in metachronous recurrences or metastases can be discordant from that observed in the primary tumor. As such changes can occur during disease progression, the evaluation of biomarkers in metastatic sites should be mandatory, whenever possible, to ensure that patients are receiving the most effective treatment at all times. © 2012 Zerbinis Medical Publications.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The evolutionarily conserved Hox family of homeodomain transcription factors plays fundamental roles in regulating cell specification along the anterior posterior axis during development of all bilaterian animals by controlling cell fate choices in a highly localized, extracellular signal and cell context dependent manner. Some studies have established downstream target genes in specific systems but their identification is insufficient to explain either the ability of Hox genes to direct homeotic transformations or the breadth of their patterning potential. To begin delineating Hox gene function in neural development we used a mouse ES cell based system that combines efficient neural differentiation with inducible Hoxb1 expression. Gene expression profiling suggested that Hoxb1 acted as both activator and repressor in the short term but predominantly as a repressor in the long run. Activated and repressed genes segregated in distinct processes suggesting that, in the context examined, Hoxb1 blocked differentiation while activating genes related to early developmental processes, wnt and cell surface receptor linked signal transduction and cell-to-cell communication. To further elucidate aspects of Hoxb1 function we used loss and gain of function approaches in the mouse and chick embryos. We show that Hoxb1 acts as an activator to establish the full expression domain of CRABPI and II in rhombomere 4 and as a repressor to restrict expression of Lhx5 and Lhx9. Thus the Hoxb1 patterning activity includes the regulation of the cellular response to retinoic acid and the delay of the expression of genes that commit cells to neural differentiation. The results of this study show that ES neural differentiation and inducible Hox gene expression can be used as a sensitive model system to systematically identify Hox novel target genes, delineate their interactions with signaling pathways in dictating cell fate and define the extent of functional overlap among different Hox genes. © 2011 Bami et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Members of the Ski/Sno protein family are classified as proto-oncogenes and act as negative regulators of the TGF-ß/BMP-pathways in vertebrates and invertebrates. A newly identified member of this protein family is fussel (fuss), the Drosophila homologue of the human functional Smad suppressing elements (fussel-15 and fussel-18). We and others have shown that Fuss interacts with SMAD4 and that overexpression leads to a strong inhibition of Dpp signaling. However, to be able to characterize the endogenous Fuss function in Drosophila melanogaster, we have generated a number of state of the art tools including anti-Fuss antibodies, specific fuss-Gal4 lines and fuss mutant fly lines via the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Fuss is a predominantly nuclear, postmitotic protein, mainly expressed in interneurons and fuss mutants are fully viable without any obvious developmental phenotype. To identify potential target genes or cells affected in fuss mutants, we conducted targeted DamID experiments in adult flies, which revealed the function of fuss in bitter gustatory neurons. We fully characterized fuss expression in the adult proboscis and by using food choice assays we were able to show that fuss mutants display defects in detecting bitter compounds. This correlated with a reduction of gustatory receptor gene expression (Gr33a, Gr66a, Gr93a) providing a molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. In addition, Fuss interacts with Rpd3, and downregulation of rpd3 in gustatory neurons phenocopies the loss of Fuss expression. Surprisingly, there is no colocalization of Fuss with phosphorylated Mad in the larval central nervous system, excluding a direct involvement of Fuss in Dpp/BMP signaling. Here we provide a first and exciting link of Fuss function in gustatory bitter neurons. Although gustatory receptors have been well characterized, little is known regarding the differentiation and maturation of gustatory neurons. This work therefore reveals Fuss as a pivotal element for the proper differentiation of bitter gustatory neurons acting within a chromatin modifying complex. © 2019 Rass et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In theory, economic instruments should overcome the market failures that lead to excessive deforestation. Secure property rights could be established and enforced to eliminate the open access problem. In practice, the size of the welfare loss that arises from market failures in the forest sector in the absence of such first-best policies is determined by the incentives, prices, and policies faced by those who make decisions about land use. In many cases, the effects of policies on deforestation are not straight-forward. For example, there are conflicting views on whether an increase in the price of logs leads to an increase or a decrease in deforestation. The effect of a change in the price of logs has particular relevance for the controversial debate about the effect on deforestation of a ban on log exports or other trade restrictions that lower the domestic price of logs. This article provides an analytical framework for determining the effects of changes in economic policies and parameters on deforestation. It models dynamic, profit-maximizing land-use choices and obtains unambiguous comparative static results by distinguishing between unmanaged and managed forests. The results suggest that measures to reduce the producer price of logs could be a second-best policy to reduce the pressures on the frontiers of unmanaged forests and to protect biodiversity.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) are emerging technologies expected to bring important environmental, social, and economic improvements in transportation systems. Given their implications in terms of air quality and sustainable and safer movement of goods, heavy-duty trucks (HDTs), carrying the majority of U.S. freight, are considered an ideal domain for the application of CAV technology. An input–output (IO) model is developed based on the Eora database—a detailed IO database that consists of national IO tables, covering almost the entire global economy. Using the Eora-based IO model, this study quantifies and assesses the environmental, economic, and social impacts of automated diesel and battery electric HDTs based on 20 macro-level indicators. The life cycle sustainability performances of these HDTs are then compared to that of a conventional diesel HDT. The study finds an automated diesel HDT to cause 18% more fatalities than an automated electric HDT. The global warming potential (GWP) of automated diesel HDTs is estimated to be 4.7 thousand metric tons CO2-eq. higher than that of automated electric HDTs. The health impact costs resulting from an automated diesel HDT are two times higher than that of an automated electric HDT. Overall, the results also show that automation brings important improvements to the selected sustainability indicators of HDTs such as global warming potential, life cycle cost, GDP, decrease in import, and increase in income. The findings also show that there are significant trade-offs particularly between mineral and fossil resource losses and environmental gains, which are likely to complicate decision-making processes regarding the further development and commercialization of the technology. © 2019 by Yale University\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This study analyzes the ‘real’ effects of accounting standards in the context of defined benefit pension plans. Specifically, we examine the impact of IAS 19R, which increases expected pension-induced equity volatility by eliminating the so-called ‘corridor method’, a smoothing device for actuarial gains and losses. Supported by interview evidence, we show that IAS 19R leads firms to reconsider their pension investment decisions. Using matched samples of treatment and control firms, results from multivariate difference-in-differences tests indicate that firms affected by the adoption of IAS 19R significantly shift their pension assets from equities into bonds, relative to control firms. This effect is attenuated for firms with larger and better-funded pension plans. Supplementary analyses suggest that this shift in pension investment is mainly due to IAS 19R’s changes in the accounting for actuarial gains and losses (the ‘OCI method’). These results are robust to several sensitivity tests, although endogeneity concerns cannot be fully ruled out.

      " Abstract: This paper analyzes the utility calculation principle of travelers from the perspective of mental accounting and proposes a travel choice behavior model that considers travel time and cost (MA-TC model). Then, a questionnaire is designed to analyze the results of the travel choice under different decision-making scenarios. Model parameters are estimated using nonlinear regression, and the utility calculation principles are developed under different hypothetical scenarios. Then, new expressions for the utility function under deterministic and risky conditions are presented. For verification, the nonlinear correlation coefficient and hit rate are used to compare the proposed MA-TC model with the other two models: (1) the classical prospect theory with travel time and cost (PT-TC model) and (2) mental accounting based on the original hedonic editing criterion (MA-HE model). The results show that model parameters under deterministic and risky conditions are pretty different. In the deterministic case, travelers have similar sensitivity to the change in gain and loss of travel time and cost. The prediction accuracy of the MA-TC model is 3% lower than the PT-TC model and 6% higher than the MA-HE model. Under risky conditions, travelers are more sensitive to the change in loss than to the change in gain. Additionally, travelers tend to overestimate small probabilities and underestimate high probabilities when losing more than when gaining. The prediction accuracy of the MA-TC model is 2% higher than the PT-TC model and 6% higher than the MA-HE model. © 2021 Shixu Liu et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aim: Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to forecast climate change impacts. These models, however, are subject to important assumptions and limitations. By integrating two independent but complementary methods, ensemble SDMs and statistical phylogeography, we addressed key assumptions and created robust assessments of climate change impacts on species distributions while improving the conservation value of these projections. Location: North American cordillera. Methods: This approach was demonstrated using the arctic-alpine plant Rhodiola integrifolia (Crassulaceae). SDMs were fitted to current and past climates using eight models, two thresholds and one to three climate data sets. These projections were combined to create a map of stable climate (refugia) since the Last Interglacial (124,000 kya). Five biogeographic hypotheses were developed based on the configuration of refugia and tested using statistical phylogeography. Projection of SDMs into the future was contingent on agreement across approaches; future projections (to 2085) used five climate data sets and two greenhouse gas scenarios. Results: A multiple-refugia hypothesis was supported by both methods, confirming the assumption of niche conservatism in R. integrifolia and justifying the projection of SDMs onto future climates. Future projections showed substantial loss of climatically suitable habitat. Southern populations had the greatest losses, although the biogeographic scale of modelling may overpredict extinction risks in areas of topographic complexity. Past and future SDMs were assessed for novel values of climate variables; areas of novel climate were flagged as having higher uncertainty. Main conclusions: Integrating molecular approaches with spatial analyses of species distributions under global change has great potential to improve conservation decision-making. Molecular tools can support and improve current methods for understanding the vulnerability of species to climate change and provide additional data upon which to base conservation decisions, such as prioritizing the conservation of areas of high genetic diversity to build evolutionary resiliency within populations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) techniques are widely used in daily life. In addition to the material characteristics and environmental conditions, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques are an efficient means to maximize the output power and improve the utilization of solar power. However, the conventional fixed step size perturbation and observation (P&O) algorithm results in perturbations and power loss around the maximum power point in steady-state operation. To reduce the power loss in steady-state operation and improve the response speed of MPPT, this study proposes a self-adaptable step size P&O-based MPPT algorithm with infinitesimal perturbations. This algorithm combines four techniques to upgrade the response speed and reduce the power loss: (1) system operation state determination, (2) perturbation direction decision, (3) adaptable step size, and 4) natural oscillation control.

      " Abstract: Given ever increasing information volume and complexity of engineering, social and economic systems, it has become more difficult to assess incoming data and manage such systems properly. Currently developed innovative decision support systems (DSS) aim to achieve optimum results while minimizing the risks of serious losses. The purpose of the DSS is to help the decision-maker facing the problem of huge amounts of data and ambiguous reactions of complicated systems depending on external factors. By means of accurate and profound analysis, DSSs are expected to provide the user with precisely forecasted indicators and optimal decisions. In this paper we suggest a new DSS structure which could be used in a wide range of difficult to formalize tasks and achieve a high speed of calculation and decision-making. We examine different approaches to determining the dependence of a target variable on input data and review the most common statistical forecasting methods. The advantages of using neural networks for this purpose are described. We suggest applying interval neural networks for calculations with underdetermined (interval) data, which makes it possible to use our DSS in a wide range of complicated tasks. We developed a corresponding learning algorithm for the interval neural networks. The advantages of using a genetic algorithm (GA) to select the most significant inputs are shown. We justify the use of general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) to achieve high-speed calculations with the decision support system in question.

      " Abstract: Background: Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the preferred dialysis modality in children. Its major drawback is the limited technique survival due to infections and progressive ultrafiltration failure. Conventional PD solutions exert marked acute and chronic toxicity to local tissues. Prolonged exposure is associated with severe histopathological alterations including vasculopathy, neoangiogenesis, submesothelial fibrosis and a gradual loss of the mesothelial cell layer. Recently, more biocompatible PD solutions containing reduced amounts of toxic glucose degradation products (GDPs) and buffered at neutral pH have been introduced into clinical practice. These solutions contain lactate, bicarbonate or a combination of both as buffer substance. Increasing evidence from clinical trials in adults and children suggests that the new PD fluids may allow for better long-term preservation of peritoneal morphology and function. However, the relative importance of the buffer in neutral-pH, low-GDP fluids is still unclear. In vitro, lactate is cytotoxic and vasoactive at the concentrations used in PD fluids. The BIOKID trial is designed to clarify the clinical significance of the buffer choice in biocompatible PD fluids. Methods/design: The objective of the study is to test the hypothesis that bicarbonate based PD solutions may allow for a better preservation of peritoneal transport characteristics in children than solutions containing lactate buffer. Secondary objectives are to assess any impact of the buffer system on acid-base status, peritoneal tissue integrity and the incidence and severity of peritonitis. After a run-in period of 2 months during which a targeted cohort of 60 patients is treated with a conventional, lactate buffered, acidic, GDP containing PD fluid, patients will be stratified according to residual renal function and type of phosphate binding medication and randomized to receive either the lactate-containing Balance solution or the bicarbonate-buffered Bicavera® solution for a period of 10 months. Patients will be monitored by monthly physical and laboratory examinations. Peritoneal equilibration tests, 24-h dialysate and urine collections will be performed 4 times. Peritoneal biopsies will be obtained on occasion of intraabdominal surgery.

      " Abstract: Ocular ischemic syndrome is a condition characterized by visual loss described mainly in males 50 years and older secondary to carotid artery stenosis or occlusion. Loss of vision results from chronic ischemic changes to the anterior and posterior segments of the eye. Pain around the eye has been reported in up to 40% of the patients. Also, these patients may report difficulty adjusting to a darker environment after light exposure. Neovascularization of the iris and retina is common. Associated systemic conditions include arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease and tobacco use. Digital subtraction angiography can demonstrate carotid artery obstruction in the majority of patients, however less invasive procedures such as contrast enhanced MR angiography in combination with duplex ultrasound correlates with the degree of carotid stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy in addition to management of neovascularization of iris or retina is the treatment of choice, however, the prognosis for visual recovery is still limited. Acute retinal arterial obstruction is a dramatic and usually irreversible painless loss of vision that can involve the central retinal artery or an arterial branch, most commonly secondary to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Other associated conditions include various hematological, infectious and metabolic abnormalities. In central retinal artery occlusion a common finding includes a cherry red spot in the macula. A careful evaluation of all potential sources of emboli is essential in this condition since there is a strong association with fatal outcome due to cardiovascular disease and stroke. Other etiologies such as coagulopathies, collagen vascular diseases and viral infections have been identified in patients with retinal arterial obstructions.

      " Abstract: The dependency of photovoltaic (PV) power generation on meteorological parameters can impact power production due to weather-induced variability. During the day, fluctuations in radiation introduce intermittency in power generated, raising reliability and grid stability issues at higher penetration levels. Long-term future resource assessment provides an effective tool for estimating resource reliability and future intermittency essential for pre-feasibility site assessments around the world. Australia has high solar power capacity, with several solar farms in operational and developmental stage. Using Australia as a case study, this research aims to understand Australia's solar resource distribution and variability using regional climate model projections under a high emission scenario. Results indicate an abundance of solar resource power density in Australia, especially in the North (450-500Wm−2). The solar resource will be more reliable in Eastern Australia in the future with ∼ 5% increase in resource density. Results suggest reduction in intermittency (∼20-minute lull periods) in the East with increase in clear-sky days/year in the future (∼20 days/year). Resource assessment of Sun Cable and New England solar farm located in Australia, revealed the future scope of increase in clear-sky days at the sites. This long-term future solar variability analysis can help identify regions in Australia where PV systems will be least susceptible to losses due to intermittency.

The chapter presents a brief overview of microtubule assembly dynamics and summarizes the current understanding of (i) the binding of vinblastine, colchicine, nocodazole, and taxol to tubulin and microtubules; (ii) the effects of the drugs on microtubule polymerization and dynamics in vitro and in cells; (iii) the levels and kinetics of cellular accumulation and loss of the compounds; (iv) the drug concentration dependence for effects on mitotic spindle organization; and (v) the advantages and disadvantages of using a particular drug for the study of microtubule assembly and dynamics. The chapter also describes the methods for measuring drug uptake into cultured cells, and summarizes some practical guidelines for drug use. First of all, one has to determine the effects of the drug on spindle microtubule organization and mitosis over a range of concentrations in the cells of choice. One should also ensure that the drug is completely solubilized and should determine the effects of varying the duration of drug incubation. © 1999 Academic Press, Inc.

      " Abstract: In patients with mental illness the increased risk from cardiovascular disease appears to be related to the increased incidence of obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Barriers to the medical care in this patient population include diminished adherence to treatment and preventative recommendations, lack of willingness to engage in self-care activities, decreased access to affordable medical care, underestimation of risk by physicians, and adverse effects of commonly prescribed psychiatric medications. When managing patients with mental illness it is necessary to estimate the patient's metabolic and cardiovascular risk, monitor BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and lipid profile regularly, evaluate psychiatric medications metabolic risk, and choose less \"metabolically threatening\" drugs. The promotion of healthy lifestyle choices among persons with serious mental illness is essential not only as part of their recovery, but as an integral part of preventing metabolic changes and weight gain linked to their illness and medication side effects. In patients with mental illness and co-morbid diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and obesity, psychiatrist and primary care clinicians should collaborate to establish a plan for healthy lifestyle habits (diet and activity regimen), encourage weight loss, and follow-up regularly using multispecialty teams to improve management. © 2011, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Healthcare providers are faced with an increasing number of patients with obesity and arterial hypertension. Preventing obesity-associated hypertension and appropriately managing patients with established disease are both important. Hence, the aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical care of patients with obesity and hypertension among ESH Excellence Centres (ECs). Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, international 30-item survey through e-mails. Results: In total, 70 representatives of ECs participated (78% men) with 66% of them practicing medicine for more than 30 years and working in well-equipped clinics. Most were internists (41%) and cardiologists (37%) and 73% reported training on the management of obese patients with hypertension. A majority weigh their patients (77%) and evaluate patients for sleep disorders (93%). However, only 47% spend more than 5min to advise for lifestyle modification in general, 59% for weight loss, 56% for salt intake and 64% for exercise. Finally, a minority of participants ask patients if they like their body (6%) or about previous attempts to lose weight (28%), evaluate 24h urinary sodium excretion rate (22%) and provide written (15%) or personalized (10%) dietary advices. If the patient suffers also from type 2 diabetes mellitus, 66% switch treatment to GLP1 receptor agonists and 60% to SGLT2 inhibitors. Conclusion: Most clinicians in ESH ECs are well educated regarding obesity-associated hypertension, and clinics are sufficiently equipped to manage these patients, as well. However, several deficits were reported regarding efforts to address and implement obesity specific aspects and interventions to improve care in patients with obesity and hypertension. © 2024 The Author(s).

      " Abstract: The interpretation of seismic images faces challenges due to the presence of several uncertainty sources. Uncertainties exist in data measurements, source positioning, and subsurface geophysical properties. Understanding uncertainties’ role and how they influence the outcome is fundamental in the earth sciences and essential in the oil and gas industry decision-making process. Geophysical imaging is time-consuming. When we add uncertainty quantification, it becomes both time and data-intensive. In this work, we propose a workflow for seismic imaging with quantified uncertainty. We build the workflow upon Bayesian tomography, reverse time migration, and image interpretation based on statistical information. The workflow explores an efficient hybrid parallel computational strategy to decrease the reverse time migration execution time. High levels of data compression are applied to reduce data transfer among workflow activities and data storage. We capture and analyze provenance data at runtime to improve workflow execution, monitoring, and debugging with negligible overhead. Numerical experiments on the Marmousi2 Velocity Model Benchmark demonstrate the workflow capabilities. We observe excellent weak and strong scalability, and results suggest that lossy data compression does not hamper the seismic imaging uncertainty quantification. We explore the propagation of the velocity uncertainties to the seismic images by confidence maps and probability density functions in control points. The multi-modal character revealed by such high-order statistics reinforces the need for the machinery we have put together in our workflow. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Reference price plays a significant role in in uencing purchase decisions of customers. Due to loss aversion, the asymmetric reference price effect on market demand should be taken into account. This paper develops a joint dynamic pricing and production model with asymmetric reference price effect. In a finite planning horizon, the demand rate is time-varying and depends on price as well as reference price. The decision-making problem with the asymmetric reference price effect turns to be a nonsmooth optimal control problem, which cannot be solved by standard optimal control method. As a special case, we first obtain the joint optimal dynamic pricing and production strategy with symmetric reference price effect by solving the corresponding standard optimal control problem based on Maximum principle. For the case of asymmetric reference price effect, we propose a systematical method on basis of optimality principle to solve the nonsmooth optimal control problem, and obtain the joint strategy. Numerical examples are employed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we assess the sensitivity analysis of system parameters to examine the impacts of asymmetric reference price on optimal pricing and production strategies and total profits. © 2019 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.\u001b[0m :\n",

Packaged on a 25 mm square ceramic module, the 4.3 × 4.1 mm chip uses a junction isolation crosspoint design fully electrically compatible with its predecessor single chip crosspoint. A very low (3 × 10–4) fraction of the device current is diverted to ground. This is obtained without any additional semiconductor processing steps. Matrix configurations using up to 144 crosspoints are defined by personalization wiring of 2 layers of metal. By comparison with the single crosspoint chip, the additional insertion loss is shown to be negligible and the crosstalk attenuation is improved. On a 760 telephone line system using these chips in a one-wire unbalanced network, we measured across the 300–4000 Hz band a maximum insertion loss of 1 dB and a crosstalk of 78 dB (at 4000 Hz) for the worst path and 87 dB for a typical path.

      " Abstract: Both power efficiency and per-channel data rates of high-speed input/output (I/O) links must be improved in order to support future inter-chip bandwidth demand. In order to scale data rates over band-limited channels, various types of equalization circuitry are used to compensate for frequency-dependent loss. However, this additional complexity introduces power and area costs, requiring selection of an appropriate I/O equalization architecture in order to comply with system power budgets. This paper presents a design flow for power optimization of high-speed electrical links at a given data rate, channel type, and process technology node, which couples statistical link analysis techniques with circuit power estimates based on normalized transistor parameters extracted with a constant current density methodology. The design framework selects the optimum equalization architecture, circuit logic style (CMOS versus current-mode logic), and transmit output swing for minimum I/O power. Analysis shows that low loss channel characteristics and minimal circuit complexity, together with scaling of transmitter output swing allows excellent power efficiency at high data rates. © 1993-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) represent the main source of cholinergic innervation to the cortex and hippocampus and degenerate early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Phenotypic maintenance of BFCNs depends on levels of mature nerve growth factor (mNGF) and mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF), produced by target neurons and retrogradely transported to the cell body. Whether a reciprocal interaction where BFCN inputs impact neurotrophin availability and affect cortical neuronal markers remains unknown. To address our hypothesis, we immunolesioned the nucleus basalis (nb), a basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei projecting mainly to the cortex, by bilateral stereotaxic injection of 192-IgG-Saporin (the cytotoxin Saporin binds p75ntr receptors expressed exclusively by BFCNs) in 2.5-month-old Wistar rats. At 6 months post-lesion, Saporin-injected rats (SAP) showed an impairment in a modified version of the 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-choice task). Postmortem analyses of the brain revealed a reduction of Choline Acetyltransferase-immunoreactive neurons compared to wild-type controls. A diminished number of cortical vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive boutons was accompanied by a reduction in BDNF mRNA, mBDNF protein levels, markers of glutamatergic (vGluT1), and GABAergic (GAD65) neurons in the SAP-group compared to the controls. NGF mRNA, NGF precursor, and mNGF protein levels were not affected. Additionally, cholinergic markers correlated with the attentional deficit and BDNF levels. Our findings demonstrate that while cholinergic nb loss impairs cognition and reduces cortical neuron markers, it produces differential effects on neurotrophin availability, affecting BDNF but not NGF levels.

      " Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for saliency detection through the utilization of a generative adversarial network guided by perceptual loss. Achieving effective saliency detection through deep learning entails intricate challenges influenced by a multitude of factors, with the choice of loss function playing a pivotal role. Previous studies usually formulate loss functions based on pixel-level distances between predicted and ground-truth saliency maps. However, these formulations don't explicitly exploit the perceptual attributes of objects, such as their shapes and textures, which serve as critical indicators of saliency. To tackle this deficiency, we propose an innovative loss function that capitalizes on perceptual features derived from the saliency map. Our approach has been rigorously evaluated on six benchmark datasets, demonstrating competitive performance when compared against the forefront methods in terms of both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and F-measure. Remarkably, our experiments reveal consistent outcomes when assessing the perceptual loss using either grayscale saliency maps or saliency-masked colour images. This observation underscores the significance of shape information in shaping the perceptual saliency cues. The code is available at https://github.com/XiaoxuCai/PerGAN. © 2023\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The management of hemangiomas of the face depends on several clinical factors. Many treatments have been recommended for the management of patients with hemangiomas. However, most of them have not shown good results in terms of post-treatment morphology and function of the organs. Surgery of these benign lesions can at times be disfiguring, especially when the lips, muscles, or the maxilla are involved. In addition, by the very nature of these lesions, surgical treatment may be associated with excessive intra and perioperative blood loss. As an alternative to surgical excision, different types of embolization treatments have been developed for all types of hemangiomas. In many instances the procedure was performed preoperatively or intraoperatively. The various therapeutic embolizations, if performed correctly, lead to a significant reduction in the blood flow within the angiomatous mass. Different types of embolization of the lesions and subsequent surgical extirpation can be considered the method of choice in the treatment of voluminous hemangiomas of the face.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The Linear Wireless Ad-Hoc Network (Linear WANET), as a branch of the Ad-Hoc network, refers to a self-organizing multi-hop wireless network in which nodes are arranged linearly. Frame aggregation and RTS/CTS schemes are introduced in IEEE 802.11 aims to improve network transmission performance. However, the traditional mechanisms may not have good adaptability in linear multi-hop networks. Thus, we defined a Linear WANET simulation model based on the IEEE 802.11 protocol. We established this model on the NS-3 network simulator to perform A-MSDU, A-MPDU, and two-level frame aggregation simulation and analyzed the aggregation performance under different channel environments. Meanwhile, the RTS/CTS and TXOP mechanisms were also simulated in this article. We analyzed the performance of each mechanism in a Linear WANET under saturated and unsaturated environments. We found that the linear multi-hop characteristic has a significant impact on the performance of the frame aggregation mechanism. In the Linear WANET, the A-MSDU mechanism can improve system performance to a limited extent, but at the same time, it will increase the packet loss rate and delay. So, the two-level aggregation can improve the maximum throughput of the system with better channel conditions. In the case of single A-MPDU aggregation, there has a lowest data delivery interval that the Linear WANET system can withstand. The A-MPDU mechanism is a better choice for the poor channel conditions with unsaturated system throughput. Meanwhile, we also found that the native TXOP mechanism cannot effectively improve the system efficiency of Linear WANET. The RTS/CTS mechanism can enhance system throughput performance in most cases, especially in a saturated throughput environment. © 2022 The Authors.

Such production processes are consistent with Kremer's O-ring production theory in which a single mistake in any one of several complementary tasks in a firm's production process can lead to catastrophic failure of the product's value. In hog production, mistakes that introduce disease or pathogens into the production facility can cause a total loss of the herd. Consistent with predictions derived from the O-ring theory, we provide evidence that the most skilled workers concentrate in the largest and most technologically advanced farms and are paid more than comparable workers on smaller farms. These findings suggest that worker skills, new technologies, and farm size are complements in production. The complementarities create returns to scale to large hog confinements, consistent with the dramatic increase in market share of very large farms over the past 20 years. © 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: In multiple sclerosis loss of myelin and oligodendrocytes impairs saltatory signal transduction and leads to neuronal loss and functional deficits. Limited capacity of oligodendroglial precursor cells to differentiate into mature cells is the main reason for inefficient myelin repair in the central nervous system. Drug repurposing constitutes a powerful approach for identification of pharmacological compounds promoting this process. Methods: A phenotypic compound screening using the subcellular distribution of a potent inhibitor of oligodendroglial cell differentiation, namely p57kip2, as differentiation competence marker was conducted. Hit compounds were validated in terms of their impact on developmental cell differentiation and myelination using both rat and human primary cell cultures and organotypic cerebellar slice cultures, respectively. Their effect on spontaneous remyelination was then investigated following cuprizone-mediated demyelination of the corpus callosum. Findings: A number of novel small molecules able to promote oligodendroglial cell differentiation were identified and a subset was found to foster human oligodendrogenesis as well as myelination ex vivo. Among them the steroid danazol and the anthelminthic parbendazole were found to increase myelin repair. Interpretation: We provide evidence that early cellular processes involved in differentiation decisions are applicable for the identification of regeneration promoting drugs and we suggest danazol and parbendazole as potent therapeutic candidates for demyelinating diseases.

      " Abstract: In games of chance, a near miss is said to occur when feedback for a loss approximates a win. For instance, obtaining “cherry–cherry–lemon” on a slot machine could be considered a near miss. Sixty-six years ago, B.F. Skinner first proposed the idea that near-miss events might reinforce continued play in slot machines, and despite some inconsistencies in the experimental literature, belief in this “near-miss effect” has remained strong. In the present manuscript, we will review this literature and present experimental assessments of the near-miss effect on the frequency of the gambling response. Experiment 1 used a tightly controlled resistance-to-extinction procedure in pigeons to evaluate the putative reinforcing effect of near misses relative to a control “far-miss” reel pattern. Experiment 2 extended Experiment 1’s procedure to human participants. The results of both experiments failed to support the near-miss effect hypothesis. Experiment 3 used a further simplified procedure to assess the validity of the resistance-to-extinction paradigm when a probable conditional reinforcer was present on the reel stimuli. Although a clear conditional response was obtained from the reel, subsequent testing in extinction revealed no conditionally reinforcing function of this stimulus on operant response frequency. © 2019, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: To guide barrier membrane choice in the treatment of peri-implant alveolar bone defects, we evaluated guided bone regeneration (GBR) using titanium (Ti) mesh or Bio-Gide membrane, independently or in combination, for repair of alveolar bone defects in Beagle dogs. Six months after extraction of the mandibular premolars and first molars from three beagle dogs, we inserted implants assigned into 3 groups and covered with the following membrane combinations: Group A: Implant + Bio-Oss + Ti-mesh, Group B: Implant + Bio-Oss + Bio-Gide, and Group C: Implant + Bio-Oss + Ti-mesh + Bio-Gide. At 6 months, micro-CT revealed that bone volume/total volume (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) was significantly greater in Group C than the other two groups, while trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) was significantly lower, suggesting improved bone regeneration. The distance between bands of three fluorescent tracking dyes was significantly greater in Group C, indicating faster deposition of new bone. The Bio-Oss particles were ideally integrated with newly deposited bone and bone thickness was significantly larger in Group C. These findings suggest that combination of Bio-Gide membrane and titanium mesh can effectively repair peri-implant alveolar bone defects, achieving enhanced bone regeneration compared to titanium mesh or Bio-Gide alone, and therefore providing a novel treatment concept for clinical implant surgery. © 2018, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

We study single-parameter mechanism-design problems in environments with restricted action spaces. In our first main result, we provide sufficient conditions under which the information-theoretically optimal solution can be implemented in equilibrium. Our second main result shows that for a wide family of social-choice rules the optimal mechanisms with k actions incur an expected loss of O(1k2) compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted action space. We also fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in some simple environments and, finally, we apply our general results to signaling games, public-good models and project planning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Floods have recently caused significant economic losses and affected a number of civil engineering structures in many countries including the Czech Republic. Various protective measures have been considered to reduce adverse consequences of flooding in future. Decisions concerning expensive measures should be preferably based on risk optimisation, taking into account cost of measures, potential societal and economic consequences and losses of cultural and heritage values in case of historic structures. Methods of probabilistic risk optimisation seem to provide a suitable tool for identification of the most effective permanent and temporary measures. Present paper provides general framework of the risk assessment of heritage structures endangered by fluvial floods. The total consequences may be assessed using Bayesian networks supplemented by decision and utility nodes.

      " Abstract: Background: Although studies have identified published indications that experts and practicing surgeons agree indicate use of damage control (DC) laparotomy, it is unknown whether these indications predict use of the procedure in practice. Materials and methods: We conducted a diagnostic performance study of the accuracy of a set of published appropriateness indications for predicting use of DC laparotomy. We included consecutive adults that underwent emergent laparotomy for trauma (2011-2016) at Memorial Hermann Hospital. Results: We included 1141 injured adults. Two published preoperative appropriateness indications [a systolic blood pressure (BP) persistently <90 mmHg or core body temperature <34°C] produced moderate shifts in the pretest probability of conducting DC instead of definitive laparotomy. Five published intraoperative appropriateness indications produced large and often conclusive changes in the pretest probability of conducting DC during emergent laparotomy. These included the finding of a devascularized or completely disrupted pancreas, duodenum, or pancreaticoduodenal complex; an estimated intraoperative blood loss >4 L; administration of >10 U of packed red blood cells (PRBCs); and a systolic BP persistently <90 mmHg or arterial pH persistently <7.2 during operation. Most indications that produced large changes in the pretest probability of conducting DC laparotomy had an incidence of 2% or less. Conclusions: This study suggests that published appropriateness indications accurately predict use of DC laparotomy in practice. Intraoperative variables exert greater influence on the decision to conduct DC laparotomy than preoperative variables, and those indications that produce large shifts in the pretest probability of conducting DC laparotomy are uncommonly encountered. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Method: Using shared decision making, 139 participants were offered intervention options: hearing aids, communication programs (group or individual), and no intervention. Multivariate analysis (logistic regression) provided odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for intervention decision predictors when all other variables were held constant. Results: Seven intervention decision predictors were identified: (a) application for subsidized hearing services (participants more likely to choose hearing aids and less likely to choose communication programs), (b) hearing impairment (hearing aids more likely and no intervention less likely), (c) communication self-efficacy (hearing aids less likely), (d) powerful others as locus of control (hearing aids less likely), (e) hearing disability perceived by others and self (hearing aids more likely), (f) perceived communication program effectiveness (communication programs more likely), and (g) perceived suitability of individual communication program (hearing aids less likely and communication programs more likely).

Methods: A classic Glaserian grounded theory methodology was used, which included 21 in-depth individual face-to-face interviews with registered midwives. Findings: The core category that emerged from the data labelled ‘Fighting a Losing Battle’ consisted of the causal, contextual and conditional factors that together form the core problem faced by the midwives. Participants depicted contemporary midwifery practice environments as ‘war like’ and described levels of work-related stress that, for many, were unbearable and led them to conclude that the job was not worth it. Conclusion: This study reveals that as the number and extent of stressors increase, the negative implications and effects for midwives rise as the opportunities to ‘do’ midwifery in the way they value decrease, and that commitment to and engagement with the work diminishes.

Grand Naine, such information are meagerly documented for other traditional varieties Rasthali, Poovan, Karpuravalli, Ney Poovan. Furthermore, investigations into glycemic response and volatile compound markers of these varieties have remained elusive. In this study, we identified more than eight distinct ripening stages these varieties. Notably, unlike the Grand Naine, the var. Ney Poovan and Karpuravalli varieties exhibited the retention of firmness even after progressive ripening to the 7–8 stages, rendering them suitable for more days of consumption. A comprehensive analysis, including a heat-map, unveiled the intricate correlations between skin colour and texture attributes, underscoring the interplay between visual appearance and fruit quality. Irrespective of varieties, sugar to acid ratio enhanced considerably over the ripening stages coupled with increase in physiological loss in weight and pulp-peel ratio. The estimated glycemic index (e-GI) values for Karpuravalli (65%) and Rasthali (67%) was higher at Stage 4, whereas the varieties like Ney Poovan and Grand Naine recorded lower GI values. GC-MS analyses at various ripening stages revealed a prevalence of esters and a concurrent reduction in unsaturated aldehydes, during the ripening, implying their pivotal role in aroma development. Besides, principal component analysis of volatile compounds at ripe stages underscored the distinctive aromatic profiles exhibited by Ney Poovan and Rasthali, setting them apart from other banana varieties. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: A future treatment for uncomplicated malaria will contain at least one component that exerts a rapid rate of kill. We describe here the validation and application of a simple, robust and rapid bioluminescence-based assay for the determination of the initial rate of kill in intra-erythrocytic asexual stages of Plasmodium falciparum. Methods: A modification to the concentration-response bioluminescence [here termed bioluminescence relative rate of kill (BRRoK)] assay, utilizing exposure to fold-IC50 concentrations (0.33× to 9×), was used to monitor the immediate cytocidal effect of 372 open-source compounds for antimalarial drug discovery available through the Medicines for Malaria Venture Malaria Box. Results: Antimalarial drugs that exert a rapid cytocidal effect produce a concentration-dependent loss of bioluminescence signal that correlates with available in vitro and in vivo estimates of parasite clearance time and parasite reduction ratio. Following the measurement of IC50 for the Malaria Box compounds in Dd2luc, the BRRoK assay was used to identify and rank 372 compounds for their initial cytocidal activity. Fifty-three compounds in the Malaria Box show an initial relative rate of kill greater than that of chloroquine, with 17 of these having an initial relative rate of kill greater than that of dihydroartemisinin. Conclusions: The BRRoK assay provides a rapid assay format for the estimation of a key pharmacodynamic property of antimalarial drug action. The simplicity and robustness of the assay suggests it would be readily scalable for high-throughput screening and a critical decision-making tool for antimalarial drug development.  © 2016 The Author 2016.

      " Abstract: Purpose: Models of speech recognition suggest that “top-down” linguistic and cognitive functions, such as use of phonotactic constraints and working memory, facilitate recognition under conditions of degradation, such as in noise. The question addressed in this study was what happens to these functions when a listener who has experienced years of hearing loss obtains a cochlear implant. Method: Thirty adults with cochlear implants and 30 age-matched controls with age-normal hearing underwent testing of verbal working memory using digit span and serial recall of words. Phonological capacities were assessed using a lexical decision task and nonword repetition. Recognition of words in sentences in speech-shaped noise was measured. Results: Implant users had only slightly poorer working memory accuracy than did controls and only on serial recall of words; however, phonological sensitivity was highly impaired. Working memory did not facilitate speech recognition in noise for either group. Phonological sensitivity predicted sentence recognition for implant users but not for listeners with normal hearing. Conclusion: Clinical speech recognition outcomes for adult implant users relate to the ability of these users to process phonological information. Results suggest that phonological capacities may serve as potential clinical targets through rehabilitative training.

The two-country model finds that previous carry trade position could positively affect current carry return and current carry trade scale. This positive relationship fosters the asset bubble of high-yielding currency, and the potential for huge losses could also make the carry trader unwind the carry trade position. Based on carry trade panel data from 22 countries and regions, this paper studies the relationship empirically through a panel vector autoregression model. The empirical results find that carry trade position has a significant positive relationship with carry return and carry trade position in following periods. Also, the empirical results suggest that foreign exchange risk could negatively affect carry return and carry trade position.

We reviewed the City of Hope experience to determine if the extent of fellow involvement in the procedure has an adverse effect on surgical outcomes. Patients and Methods: We reviewed the charts of 1833 patients who underwent RALP at the City of Hope from January 2004 to September 2007. During the academic year, each fellow has participated in 300 or more RALP with a systematic stepwise approach to learning the operation. The procedure is divided into six segments arranged by the sequence of learning. We examined intraoperative and perioperative outcomes stratified by quartiles of the academic year corresponding to the fellows' progress through the different segments of the operation. Results: No differences were found across quartiles of the academic year for intraoperative or perioperative complications, length of hospital stay, continence rates at 1 year, time to continence, and prostate-specific antigen-free recurrence rates. In the 1st and 3rd quarters of the academic year, from July to September and January to March, there were slightly longer operative times with a mean of 2.9 hours compared with the 2nd and 4th quarter mean of 2.8 hours (P = 0.01). The 3rd quarter also demonstrated slightly higher estimated blood loss of 280 mL compared with the overall mean of 262 mL (P = 0.02). During the 3rd quarter of the year, the fellows are reliably performing bladder neck division, urethral anastomosis, and beginning to learn the dissection of the neurovascular bundles.

      " Abstract: Currently, working in the overcrowded shared unlicensed spectrum band, leads to a reduction in the quality of communications in wireless networks. This makes a considerable increase in packet loss caused by collisions that necessitates packets retransmissions. In the case of wireless sensor networks (WSN), a large amount of energy of sensor nodes will be wasted by these retransmissions. Cognitive radio technology makes it possible for sensor nodes, to opportunistically use licensed bands with better propagation characteristics and less congestion. In this paper a routing method for cognitive radio wireless sensor networks (CR-CEA) is presented, that is based on a cross-layer design that jointly considers route and spectrum selection. The CR-CEA method has two main phases: next hop selection and channel selection. The routing is performed hop-by-hop with local information and decisions, which are more compatible with sensor networks. Primary user activity and prevention from interference with them, is considered in all spectrum decisions. It uniformly distributes frequency channels between adjacent nodes, which lead to a local reduction in collision probability. This clearly affects energy consumption in all sensor nodes. In CR-CEA, route selection is energy-aware and a learning-based technique is used to reduce the packet delay in terms of hop-count. The simulation results reveal that by applying cognitive radio technology to WSNs and selecting a proper operating channel, we can consciously decrease collision probability. This saves energy of sensor nodes and improves the network lifetime. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

Methods: Records from 10 Chinese patients treated for primary orbital liposarcoma at Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, between September 2009 and September 2020 were reviewed. Results: This cohort included four men and six women with age of onset ranging from 18 to 80 years. The pathology was myxoid liposarcoma in five patients, dedifferentiated liposarcoma in two patients, well-differentiated liposarcoma and pleomorphic liposarcoma in one patient each, and dedifferentiated liposarcoma and well-differentiated liposarcoma co-existing in one case. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a well-defined, irregular, or lobulated mass in the orbit, which contained components that were suppressible in the fat-suppression sequence, as well as components that were enhanced by gadolinium enhancement. Nine patients relapsed after surgery, with a mean recurrence of 2.44, and one patient was lost to follow-up. The interval between treatment and first recurrence ranged from 4 months to 16 years; 55.6% of patients with orbital liposarcoma relapsed within one year. Three patients underwent local excision alone, four patients underwent excision combined with radiotherapy, and three patients underwent exenteration. Half of the patients were misdiagnosed in the pathologic diagnosis after their first or multiple surgeries. No distant metastasis, death from tumors, or invasion of adjacent organs was observed after 21–150 months of follow-up. Conclusion: Orbital liposarcoma is easily misdiagnosed and prone to recurrence; however, MRI findings may help identify orbital liposarcoma prior to surgery.

      " Abstract: An optimal sizing model for a hybrid micro-grid system (HMGS) consisting of solar photovoltaic, wind turbine, diesel generator and battery is developed. A tri-objective formulation, considering techno-socio-economic factors, is proposed for finding the optimal size and configuration. Dynamic domain search is employed using a hybrid intelligent computational technique that integrated the improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with an enhanced differential evolution (DE) model for improving the search efficiency. The idea behind the hybridization of these two popular paradigms is to deploy the higher exploration capability of the PSO during the initial search and then employ the fast convergence property of the DE to achieve an optimal solution through exploitation. A fuzzy attainment module (FAM) is appended to identify the best solution based on the highest possible attainment level for all objectives. Two power management strategies are modelled and their effect on emission curtailment is studied. Optimal sizing is analysed considering the effect of selected optimization objective(s) and multiple choices are offered to the designer based on preferences. For the selected remote island, the system with solar PV capacity 78.44 kW, wind turbine of 95 kW with a battery of 2 kW is found to be the best option.

Calculations of the number of Navajo women at risk of unintended pregnancy suggest that several hundred such pregnancies would have occurred as a result of the withdrawal of intrauterine devices from the United States' market. Analysis of birthrate data confirms this estimate: approximately four to five percent of Navajo births in 1988 may have been due to this market withdrawal. Available data are limited in their ability to assess impacts on small groups of health-policy decisions made for the population as a whole. A mechanism for surveilling such effects needs to be established to protect the interests of such groups, particularly when they have restricted alternatives.; This study examined the impact on the birth rate from the loss of the IUD as a contraceptive option among Navajo women in the US. The Indian Health Service was not able to supply the more expensive Progestasert IUD after withdrawal of the Lippes Loop and the Copper-7. Medical, social, economic, or cultural factors interfered with acceptance of alternative methods. They hypothesis that IUD withdrawal led to increased births among the Navajo beginning in 1987 was examined by looking at trends in the birth rate and projecting excess births based on women at risk. Data were obtained from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 census, national survey data, and National Center for Health Statistics data. 24.67% of Navajos were women of reproductive age (15-44 years) in 1980; assuming the same percentage in 1986, when the total Navajo population was 169,019, 41,697 were females of reproductive age, of which 36,248 were nonpregnant, and 5449 had births. Estimates of contraceptive use from facilities data indicated 43.9% using the IUD in 1985, and 54.5% of reproductive age women having used contraception in 1982. An estimated 13% of unintended pregnancies was found among women discontinuing IUD use. The trends in birth rates showed sharp declines from 1965 to the mid 1970s, and a gradual decline between the mid 1970s and 1986. It was postulated that there would be a delayed impact because of the gestation period, and slow discontinuation, effects not evident until 1987 or 1988. Two models were tested; the 1st used a dummy variable of 0, 0.5, and 1.0 for years 1976-86, 1987, and 1988 and 1989; and the 2nd used a value of 1.0 for the dummy for 1987-89 and 1976-1986. The expectation was that 942 unintended pregnancies (13%) would have resulted from 50% contraceptive use of the 36,248 reproductive age women nonpregnant, of which use 40% was the IUD. An assumption of 24% contraceptive use would yield 294 unintended pregnancies in the first year after the IUDs became unavailable. Both models showed the predictor variables to be significant, based on the one sided t statistic. A significant increase in births appeared in 1987-89 based on the derivation of a linear equation. Analysis with a comparative population or better data would secure the accuracy of findings.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Alopecia areata (AA) severity varies from a single small patch to complete loss of scalp hair, body hair, eyelashes and eyebrows. While 40% of all affected individuals only ever get one patch and will achieve a spontaneous complete durable remission within 6 months, 27% will develop additional patches but still achieve complete durable remission within 12 months and 33% will develop chronic AA. Without systemic treatment, 55% of individuals with chronic AA will have persistent multifocal relapsing and remitting disease, 30% will ultimately develop alopecia totalis and 15% will develop alopecia universalis. The unpredictable course and psychological distress attributable to AA contributes to the illness associated with AA. Numerous topical, intralesional and systemic agents are currently used to treat AA; however, there is a paucity of data evaluating their use, effectiveness and tolerability. Topical therapy, including topical glucocorticosteroids, minoxidil and immunotherapy, can be used in cases of limited disease. There are no universally agreed indications for initiating systemic treatment for AA. Possible indications for systemic treatment include rapid hair loss, extensive disease (≥50% hair loss), chronic disease, severe distress or a combination of these factors. Currently available systemic treatments include glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, ciclosporin, azathioprine, dapsone, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and sulfasalazine. The optimal treatment algorithm has not yet been described. The purpose of this consensus statement is to outline a treatment algorithm for AA, including the indications for systemic treatment, appropriate choice of systemic treatment, satisfactory outcome measures and when to discontinue successful or unsuccessful treatment. © 2018 The Australasian College of Dermatologists\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Since 1974, replantation of 564 digits in 390 cases has been performed with a survival rate of 94%. On the basis of these experiences, a report has been made on sensory recovery, return of function, state of use and indications for surgery. Detailed study of sensory recovery was made and it was found that return of sensations and perspiration began in order of pressure, touch, pain, cold, heat and perspiration and meantime of recovery was: pressure 9.8 weeks, touch 11.6 weeks, pain 13.4 weeks, cold 15.3 weeks, heat 16.8 weeks and perspiration 26.9 weeks. There was a close relationship between time of sensory recovery and 2 PD restoration, that is, the earlier the recovery of sensation, the better the 2 PD results, but when recovery was attained later than 4 months after surgery, useful return of 2 PD cannot be expected. Sensory recovery of replanted digits was comparatively good, but motor restoration was poor. As there is at present a limitation in the extent of functional recovery, it is necessary to make a definite decision as to whether emphasis is to be placed on function or cosmetic appearance. In the case of an amputated thumb, maintaining the length of the thumb is as important as recovery of mobility and sensation. Therefore, shortening of the length should be kept to the strict minimum. For multiple digit amputations, replantation should be performed in the order of functional importance, i.e., thumb, middle finger and ring finger, index finger and little finger. Further, efforts should be made to reattach all of the amputated digits. When considering site of amputation, replantation of portions beyond the midsection of the middle phalanx is a good indication because as the functions of the MP and PIP joints are intact, even though there is a loss of mobility of the DIP joint, if sensation is regained, there would be hardly any impairment of function. As there have been digits in which circulatory disturbance has suddenly developed more than two weeks after surgery, the patients should be instructed not to smoke nor expose the affected site to cold for at least 3 months after surgery.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: We have examined the relationship between intentional and unintentional weight loss and the reasons underlying intention to lose weight and all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD causes in older men. Methods: Prospective study of 4869 men aged 56 to 75 years drawn from general practices in 24 British towns, who in 1996 completed questionnaires about intentional and unintentional weight loss over the preceding 4 years and were followed up for a subsequent 7 years. Results: Unintentional but not intentional weight loss was associated with a significant increase in risk of all-cause mortality compared with men who reported no weight change, even after adjustment for lifestyle characteristics and preexisting disease (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-2.19; and RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91-1.10, respectively). Men who lost weight intentionally as a result of personal choice showed significant benefit in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34-1.00; P = .05), which was largely owing to a significant reduction in mortality from non-CVD causes (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.87). The benefit in these men was most apparent in markedly overweight men (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters] ≥28) and in younger men (age <65 years). Men who lost weight intentionally owing to ill health or physician's advice showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.96-1.94). No harm or benefit was seen for CVD mortality, irrespective of reasons for intentional weight loss. Conclusion: Intentional weight loss carried out for personal reasons is associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in markedly overweight men, and the data suggest that the earlier the intervention, the greater the chance of benefit.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: To describe the management and perinatal outcomes of pregnancies affected by severe, early onset Rhesus isoimmunization treated with fetal intraperitoneal transfusions (IPTs). Study design: A ten-year consecutive case series of fetuses undergoing IPTs before 20 weeks gestation at Wessex Fetal Medicine Unit, Southampton, UK. Women with fetuses at risk of early onset fetal anaemia (before 20 weeks gestation) were identified from their obstetric history and maternal antibody levels at the time of booking. They were referred to our tertiary referral center. The decision to initiate transfusion was aided by middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity as an indicator of fetal anaemia. No fetus was hydropic at the first transfusion. IPTs were commenced from as early as 15 weeks gestation in fetuses with difficult vascular access and performed regularly using this method until the cord could be successfully entered for intravascular transfusions. The main outcome measures were procedure and non procedure-related perinatal losses. Results: 11 fetuses underwent 45 IPTs. 10/11 (91%) were delivered after 33 weeks gestation. There was one perinatal loss 1/11 (9%: 95% C.I 1.6–38%) from a cord accident during intravascular transfusion at 26 weeks gestation. There were no procedure related fetal losses or complications at the time of early IPTs. Conclusions: Previous studies report a perinatal loss rate with early intrauterine transfusion of 24% in gestations below 20 weeks using the intravascular route. This series suggests that intraperitoneal transfusion can be a safe and effective treatment for severe fetal anaemia at early gestations where vascular access is difficult. © 2019\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper, a new basic structure of asymmetrical multilevel inverter with optimum number of components for photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy system is proposed. The aim is to reduce the number of components required to achieve a high number of output levels compared to older topologies. The inverter configuration comprises of two basic units connected to a packed H-Bridge. Cascaded operation of the inverter configuration is feasible for higher level generation. The magnitudes of the DC sources are selected in binary sequence to maximize the number of output levels. Solar panels with proportional-integral (PI) controlled DC-DC converters are used as the DC sources. The switch modulations are achieved by pre-defined switching angles which are calculated to minimize total harmonic distortion (THD) in the AC output waveforms. This method is used instead of the classic pulse width modulation (PWM) technique to reduce the total switching loss and the required processing power in generating the switching signals. Compared to the conventional multilevel inverter topologies, the proposed inverter is a better choice in terms of the number of components. It also achieves a good balance between the number of components and total blocking voltage. Hence, its installation will require smaller space and cost. Another merit of the proposed topology is that it produces AC output with low THD at high efficiency. The efficacy of the proposed asymmetrical 31-level inverter topology is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and is further verified through experimental analysis. © 2020\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impacts of storage losses and market development on the maize-selling behaviours of rural households in China. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the survey data of 543 households from nine major maize production provinces in China, the authors introduce storage losses to a household's maize-selling decision-making model and use fractional logit model and ordered probit model to empirically analyse the impact of maize storage losses and market development on household maize-selling decisions in China. To overcome potential endogeneity problems, the authors select the weather at drying (whether bad weather occurs during the drying process) and harvest loss as instrumental variables and re-estimate the model. Findings: The results show that increased storage losses prompt farmers to increase the proportion of maize sold within three months after harvest and sell maize in advance. Meanwhile, the degree of market development has a significant impact on farmers' maize-selling decisions. Other factors, such as the maize output, non-agricultural employment and awareness of loss control, also affect farmers' maize-selling behaviours. Research limitations/implications: The government should promote advanced storage facilities, reduce household storage losses, decrease the phenomenon of centralised sales after harvest and help farmers freely choose the suitable time for sales. The government also needs to strengthen market information releases and publicity, reduce transaction costs and help farmers make reasonable sales decisions. Originality/value: The authors introduce storage losses as a separate variable in a farmer's grain-selling decision model to empirically analyse the impact of storage losses on farmers' grain-selling behaviours. Moreover, the authors analyse the impact of market development on household grain-selling behaviours in China. These findings can help avoid oversupply in the market during the harvest season and alleviate the pressure on the market from the supply and demand imbalance. These results are also beneficial for farmers waiting for a higher price and increasing their income. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This study aims to provide an optimization model for operational efficiency in individual firms with cap-and-trade carbon emissions regulation. In addition, this study assumes that customers' demand takes a probability distribution. Under this circumstance, our intention is to draw theoretical and policy implications for carbon emissions regulation by setting and analyzing newsvendor models in which the decision maker is loss-averse for her risk preference. Then, we formulate two loss-averse newsvendor models where we use a \"kinked\" piecewise linear and concave utility function. More specifically, we show that our objective functions are concave to derive the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. After then, through a comparative static analysis, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of how the model parameters affect the optimal solution. Then, the analytical results can be summarized as follows. First, in a lost-sale model, loss aversion significantly affects the optimal policy of newsvendors' decision-making with cap-and-trade regulations. Second, in a stockout penalty cost model, the inclusion of cap-and-trade regulation terms and shortage penalty costs adds more structural complexity in the optimal solution. Thus, the directions of the impacts are mixed and the impacts on the optimal solutions are not monotone, especially with cap-and-trade terms. All these analytical results show big differences between the existing risk-neutral and our loss-averse models, which are confirmed by numerical experiments. © 2018 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In Greenland, polar bears (Ursus maritimus) are nutritional, economic, and cultural subsistence resources for Inuit. Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) collected from subsistence hunters can provide important insights and improve management decisions when collected systematically. We report on the results of a TEK survey of subsistence polar bear hunters living in the areas around Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, East Greenland. Twenty-five full-time polar bear hunters were interviewed between December 2014 and March 2015 in a conversation-style interview, where a local interviewer fluent in the East Greenlandic dialect asked a series of 55 predetermined questions. The primary goals were to (1) gather Inuit perspectives on polar bear subsistence quotas and hunting strategies, (2) understand how climate change is affecting the polar bear subsistence hunt, and (3) document observed changes in polar bear distribution, abundance, and biology. Approximately 40% of the Tasiilaq respondents had caught between 10 and 19 polar bears in their lifetime, while 67% of Ittoqqortoormiit respondents reported lifetime catches of ≥20 bears. In both areas, polar bears were most commonly hunted between February and April. Hunters noted large changes to the climate in the areas where they hunt polar bears. Most hunters reported loss of sea ice, receding glaciers, unstable weather, and warmer temperatures. In Tasiilaq 73% of the hunters said climate changes had affected the polar bear hunt and in Ittoqqortoormiit about 88% of respondents reported the same. Hunters indicated that sea ice loss has created more areas of open water so dog sledges have become unsafe for hunting transportation compared to 10-15 years ago (reported by 100% of hunters in Tasiilaq and 80% in Ittoqqortoormiit). In Ittoqqortoormiit, the distance traveled during polar bear hunting trips has decreased dramatically. In both areas hunters noted that more polar bears are coming into their communities compared to 10-15 years ago (81% of Tasiilaq hunters and 78% of Ittoqqortoormiit hunters) and pointed to the introduction of quotas and loss of sea ice as potential reasons.

In its derivation, we divide the phase space into two sectors, the interior of the integration domain as well as the integration boundary, which we include here for the first time. To demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of our algorithm, we calculate the N2LP corrections for Higgs hadroproduction for the first time. We observe that our approximate N2LP-accurate qT spectra replicate the asymptotic behaviour of the full QCD calculation to a much better degree than the previously available results, both within the qT → 0 limit and in the large-qT domain for all the involved partonic processes. While playing a minor role at larger transverse momenta, we show that the newly incorporated boundary contribution plays a vital role in the qT → 0 limit, where any subleading power accuracy would be lost without them. In particular, our N2LP-accurate qT expansion can approximate the exact qT distribution up to qT ≈ 30 GeV at the percent level for rapidities |YH| ≲ 3. © The Author(s) 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: Open surgery is the most common treatment of thyroglossal duct cyst (TGDC), but it leaves obvious neck scarring. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and strategy of total endoscopic procedure by breast approach to avoid such scarring on the neck. Materials and Methods: This study reviewed 13 patients who underwent endoscopic resection of TGDC and 15 patients who underwent open resection of TGDC. We compared and analyzed factors including operative time, estimated blood loss, postoperative hospitalization, complications, and cosmetic effect. Results: The surgery by the endoscopic approach was successfully completed in 13 cases and no one was converted to an open procedure. Another 15 cases were successfully performed by an open procedure. There were no significant differences between the 2 procedures in the mean cyst size, drainage time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay. The cosmetic effect was better and the operative time was longer in the endoscopic approach. Two cases had swallowing discomfort after surgery in the endoscopic approach, whereas one case developed this complication in the open approach. On patient treated with each approach developed infection. One patient developed skin bruise and one patient developed subcutaneous hydros in the endoscopic approach, whereas no complications developed in the open approach. There were no incidences of uncontrolled bleeding, tracheal injury, dysphagia, salivary fistula, or asphyxia/ dyspnea in both approaches, nor were there any deaths or recurrences of TGDC during the follow-up period. Conclusion: With strict indications, the total endoscopic breast procedure is feasible and effective for selected patients.

      " Abstract: This article analyzes the provisions under which the property of legal entities of religious organizations in Poland nationalized during the Polish People’s Republic is revindicated after the year 1989. The paper discusses models and methods of regulating the property matters of church legal entities, tak-ing into account numerous changes in the legal status due to subsequent amendments to the provisions as well as the evolution of their interpretation by the judicature and doctrine. Special attention is paid to debatable legal issues, including the unauthorized differentiation of the legal situations of individual religious organizations. It can be concluded that the legislator has consistently enfranchised all church legal entities by applying the status quo principle. The only provisions that raise objections are those of Art. 60 para. 6 of the Act on the relationship between the State and the Catholic Church and Art. 35 para. 3 of the Act on the relationship between the State and the Evangelical Methodist Church, according to which a complaint to a voivode on the failure to issue a decision can be submitted after a period of two years from the date of initiation of administrative proceedings. The regulatory proceedings introduced into the Polish legal system by the provisions of the Act of 1989 on the relationship between the State and the Catholic Church, duplicated in the provisions of the Acts on the relationship between the State and the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession, and Jewish Religious Communities, as well as in the Act on guarantees of freedom of conscience and religion were original and innovative in many respects. Based on the proceedings, it was possible to pursue claims out-of-court with the participation of the interested parties, that is, church legal entities and the State. In retrospect, the regulatory proceedings can be considered an instrument of transitional justice. Over the years, however, as a result of the negligence of the legislator, that instrument has become increasingly inconsistent with the 1997 Constitution of the Republic of Poland and the stand-ards set by it. With regard to the possibility of transferring agricultural property located in the Western and Northern Territories of Poland to legal entities of religious organizations, no ad quem deadline to submit appli-cations has been established for legal entities of the Catholic Church. Meanwhile, additional restrictive criteria have been introduced and the list of entities authorized to transfer the property narrowed down. Allowing legal entities of the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church, Evangelical Reformed Church, and Baptist Church to file new revindication requests in 2004 in the course of transforming the administrative proceedings into regulatory proceedings should be assessed negatively. The objections raised are mainly the result of the lack of a post-transition systemic solution to the issue of revindication not only of the property of religious organizations but, most of all, other entities. Even though 30 years have passed since the change in the political system in Poland, regulating property relations, including compensation for losses resulting from the activities of the communist authorities, remains an unsolved issue. © 2022, John Paul II Catholic University of Lublin.

      " Abstract: This study analyzed the variability of the hydrological regime in a Chinese watershed and in the available water resources and used this data to develop an optimal environmental flow allocation model that lets decision-makers work towards sustainable management of the watershed's water resources. First, historical hydrological data was analyzed to determine its statistical parameters, flow duration characteristics, and trends based on data from two gauging stations (at the West Dayang and Wangkuai reservoirs) from 1956 to 2000 and data for Baiyangdian Lake from 1950 to 2005. The monthly and annual inflows and lake water levels were found to be highly variable. The optimization model that was developed for environmental flow allocation to the lake seeks a rational balance of providing appropriate environmental water to the lake, maximizing economic returns for humans, and minimizing agricultural yield losses. The appropriate quantity of environmental water was defined by minimizing the difference between the regulated and natural flow regimes. Scenario analysis then provided a range of potential management strategies for the socioeconomic, agricultural, and environmental water uses in the watershed surrounding the lake and revealed the effects of assigning different weights to these three objectives. The optimal results will help the lake's managers to develop aquatic ecosystem restoration strategies, establish sustainable water regimes, and perform environmentally and economically sound management. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Although the retroperitoneal approach has been the preferred choice for open urological procedures, retroperitoneoscopy is not the preferred approach for laparoscopy. This study aims to develop a training model for retroperitoneoscopy and to establish an experimental learning curve. Material and methods: Fifteen piglets were operated on to develop a standard retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy (RPN) training model. All procedures were performed with three ports. Intraoperative data (side, operative time, blood loss, peritoneal opening) were recorded. Animals were divided into groups A, the first eight, and B, the last seven cases. Data were statistically analyzed. Results: We performed fifteen RPNs. The operative time varied from 15 to 50 minutes (median 30 minutes). Blood loss varied from 5 to 100 mL (median 20 mL). We experienced five peritoneal openings; we had two surgical vascular complications managed laparoscopically. There was statistical difference between groups A and B for peritoneal opening (p = 0.025), operative time (p = 0.0037), and blood loss (p = 0.026). Discussion: RPN in a porcine model could simulate the whole procedure, from creating the space to nephrectomy completion. Experimental learning curve was eight cases, after statistical data analysis. Conclusion: RPN in a porcine model is feasible and could be very useful for teaching and practicing retroperitoneoscopy. © Informa Healthcare.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This study examines the process of shoreline regulation through the citizen-led permitting process by local wetlands boards in Virginia, focusing on the perceptions of the permit decision-making team and the factors considered in their decision making. Analysis of the decision process reveals the intricacies of the management of tidal wetlands and how they affect the long-term sustainability of wetlands. Results show that the process of compromise and negotiation with property owners is valued highly as part of the permit-seeking process, resulting in very few permits being denied. Decision makers perceived that environmental change and increased flooding are risks to their community, but also that their decisions are balancing environmental concerns and protecting wetlands. This perception that permit decisions appropriately protect tidal wetlands is at odds with studies by wetlands scientists that suggest the citizen regulatory process fails to achieve the no net loss of wetlands policy goals and does not result in sustainability for wetlands. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Two flow cytometric assays using physiological probes were used on the phytoplankton species Phaeocystis pouchetii and Micromonas pusilla to examine the assays' utility in detecting viral infections. Dead cells were detected using the membrane impermeant nucleic-acid dye SYTOX-Green, which stains algal cells that have lost their membrane integrity. Live cells were detected using the membrane permeant dye Calcein-AM, which is hydrolyzed by intracellular esterases into a green fluorescent charged form. We found that both assays are easy to use, are reproducible and can indeed be used as markers of the viability of individual phytoplankton cells following infection by viruses. Cell death rates up to 0.8 d-1 for P. pouchetii and 0.5 d-1 for M. pusilla were calculated. The first day postinfection, death rates determined by the Calcein-AM assay were typically twice as high as those determined by the SYTOX-Green assay. Both viability tests were found to assess the physiological status of noninfected P. pouchetii cells, independent of viral infection. The optimal choice of viability assay depended on the phytoplankton species studied. Compared with existing assays, the protocols described permit examination of infected phytoplankton in more detail, yielding insight into the heterogeneity of the algal population.\u001b[0m :\n",

Among renewable energy resources we know today, solar energy is the most beneficial, relatively limitless, effective, and dependable. Having this in mind, the aim of this paper is primarily to help key decisionmakers understand the process when considering integration of solar energy to meet their own manufacturing energy needs, or how it is called today, to become “prosumers”. Given the aforementioned, this paper provides an overview of detailed simulation methodology for photovoltaic system sizing and design for metal-forming manufacturing system energy needs. The simulation is based on National Renewable Energy Laboratory photovoltaic performance model which combines module and inverter sub-models with supplementary code to calculate a photovoltaic power system's hourly AC output is given a weather file and data describing the physical characteristics of the module, inverter, and array. Furthermore, the characteristic losses are calculated and presented for a fixed array photovoltaic system and illustratively given in the form of a Sankey diagram.

      " Abstract: Integrated model systems that simulate land use and land cover change (LUCC) and associated changes of ecosystem services (ES) are increasingly important for supporting policies and management decisions. However, only few model frameworks exist that consider policy options as drivers of future LUCC and ES simultaneously. We present a modeling procedure that predicts policy-induced LUCC and ES through a combination of cellular automata (CA) and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). We employed this procedure to assess the efficiency of alternative policy instruments including direct payments and command-and-control regulations in mountain watersheds of South Korea. Our approach successfully captures spatial patterns of LUCC, hydrological processes, and the associated gains and losses in ES as well as potential negative externalities (“leakage” effects). Our modeling procedure provides an informative and robust basis for the development of decision support systems for mountain watersheds, where water provision and regulation are of particular concern. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: To estimate the expenditure incurred towards treatment of an episode of respiratory infection among under-fives in outpatient and inpatient departments of primary and secondary level health facilities. Methods: During March 2011 – September 2012, under-five children presenting with febrile acute respiratory infection (FARI) in the outpatient (OPD) and inpatient (IPD) departments of public and private health facilities of Ballabgarh, Haryana were enrolled in the study. Children who were free from co-morbidities and whose contact number or proper address were available, were enrolled and followed up over telephone or by house visits till recovery. Information was collected on expenditure incurred towards treatment of FARI. Work loss of each day was valued as per capita national income per day. Cost of service in public facilities were supplemented by WHO-CHOICE estimates. The cost of respiratory episode in different settings are expressed in median and inter quartile range (IQR). Results: One hundred fourteen children from OPD and 75 from IPD were enrolled and followed up till recovery. Among eligible children 40% and 20% in OPD and IPD were excluded respectively as they could not provide address or contact number. The median costs of an episode treated in OPD and IPD were INR 447(IQR: INR 294–669) and INR 7506.06 (IQR: INR 3765–10,406) respectively. Conclusions: Respiratory infections are responsible for substantial economic burden, especially with huge proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure.

Thanks to its success, TRON’s native token, TRX, has been widely adopted by a large audience. To facilitate easy management of digital assets with TRON Wallet, users can securely store and manage their digital assets with ease. Our goal is first to develop a methodology to predict the future price using regression and then move on to build an effective classifier to predict whether a profit or loss is made the next day and then make a prediction of the transaction success rate. Our framework is capable of predicting whether there will be a profit in the future based on price prediction and forecasting results using regressors such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost with (Formula presented.) values of 0.9820, 0.9825 and 0.9858, respectively. In this work, an ensemble-based stacking classifier with the Whale optimization approach has been proposed which achieves the highest accuracy of 89.05 percent to predict if there will be a profit or loss the next day and an accuracy of 98.88 percent of TRX transaction success rate prediction which is higher than accuracies obtained by standard machine learning models.

Ten listeners with mild-to-moderate hearing loss were fitted monaurally with a behind-the-ear hearing aid programmed sequentially with WDRC, compression limiting, and linear peak clipping amplification. Speech was presented in quiet and in noise at a range of input levels. In each condition, the listener adjusted the volume for maximum clarity. Signal levels were measured using a probe microphone system. There was no significant difference in speech audibility between amplification strategies for any speech level regardless of the presence or absence of background noise. These results imply that the improved audibility advantage of WDRC over linear amplification demonstrated in controlled environments may not be maintained in situations where the hearing aid wearer controls the volume.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: A 1991 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference concluded that severely obese adults could be eligible for bariatric surgery if they had a body mass index (BMI) ≥35 kg/m2 with or ≥40 kg/m2 without obesity comorbidity. It was thought at that time that there were inadequate data to support bariatric surgery in severely obese adolescents. An estimated 25% of children in the United States are obese, a number that has doubled over a 30-year period. Very little information has been published on the subject of obesity surgery in adolescents. Therefore we reviewed our 20-year database on bariatric surgery in adolescents. Severely obese adolescents, ranging from 12 to less than 18 years of age, were considered eligible for bariatric surgery according to the National Institutes of Health adult criteria. Gastroplasty was the procedure of choice in the initial 3 years of the study followed by gastric bypass, which was found to be significantly more effective for weight loss in adults. Distal gastric bypass (D-GBP) was used in extremely obese patients (BMI ≥60 kg/m2) before 1992 and long-limb gastric bypass (LL-GBP) was used for superobese patients (BMI ≥50 kg/m2) after 1992. Laparoscopic gastric bypass was used after 2000. Thirty-three adolescents (27 white, 6 black; 19 females, 14 males) underwent the following bariatric operations between 1981 and June 2001: horizontal gastroplasty in one, vertical banded gastroplasty in two, standard gastric bypass in 17 (2 laparoscopic), LL-GBP in 10, and D-GBP in three. Mean BMI was 52 ± 11 kg/m2 (range 38 to 91 kg/m2), and mean age was 16 ± 1 years (range 12.4 to 17.9 years). Preoperative comorbid conditions included the following: type II diabetes mellitus in two patients, hypertension in 11, pseudotumor cerebri in three, gastroesophageal reflux in five, sleep apnea in six, urinary incontinence in two, polycystic ovary syndrome in one, asthma in one, and degenerative joint disease in 11. There were no operative deaths or anastomotic leaks. Early complications included pulmonary embolism in one patient, major wound infection in one, minor wound infections in four, stomal stenoses (endoscopically dilated) in three, and marginal ulcers (medically treated) in four. Late complications included small bowel obstruction in one and incisional hernias in six patients. There were two late sudden deaths (2 years and 6 years postoperatively), but these were unlikely to have been caused by the bariatric surgical procedure. Revision procedures included one D-GBP to gastric bypass for malnutrition and one gastric bypass to LL-GBP for inadequate weight loss. Regain of most or all of the lost weight was seen in five patients at 5 to 10 years after surgery; however, significant weight loss was maintained in the remaining patients for up to 14 years after surgery. Comorbid conditions resolved at 1 year with the exception of hypertension in two patients, gastroesophageal reflux in two, and degenerative joint disease in seven. Self-image was greatly enhanced; eight patients have married and have children, five patients have completed college, and one patient is currently in college. Severe obesity is increasing rapidly in adolescents and is associated with significant comorbidity and social stigmatization. Bariatric surgery in adolescents is safe and is associated with significant weight loss, correction of obesity comorbidity, and improved self-image and socialization. These data strongly support obesity surgery for those unfortunate individuals who may have difficulty obtaining insurance coverage based on the 1991 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference statement. © 2003 The Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background and objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) polymorphism on adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in Hakka patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) receiving clopidogrel who had undergone coronary drug-eluting stent placement after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in southern China. Methods: Genotyping of CYP2C19 and MACE of 934 ACS patients with PCI on clopidogrel maintenance therapy were analyzed. Patients who carried loss-of-function CYP2C19 were treated with a 150-mg maintenance dose of clopidogrel or 90 mg of ticagrelor antiplatelet therapy, and patients who were non-carriers received clopidogrel therapy daily at a maintenance dose of 75 mg and the patients were followed-up for at least 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization and stroke. Results: The allelic frequency of CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 of Hakka patients in the current study was 31.64 and 5.19%, respectively. The CYP2C19 wild-type homozygotes (*1/*1) were the most predominant among the patients (40.36%), followed by the CYP2C19*2 heterozygotes (*1/*2) (40.26%). The distribution of CYP2C19 phenotypes was divided into extensive metabolizers (EM; 40.36%), intermediate metabolizers (IM; 45.61%), and poor metabolizers (PM; 14.03%). Based on the genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy, there was no significant association between the carrier status and the clinical outcome at 1, 6, and 12 months. In addition, no significant difference in the rates of bleeding was found among the three groups. After logistic regression analysis, hypertension was the only independent predictor of cardiovascular events (relative risk, 1.501; 95% CI, 1.011 to 2.229; P = 0.044). Conclusions: Our results shed new light on the important benefit of testing CYP2C19 polymorphisms before prescribing clopidogrel in patients treated with drug-eluting stent implantation after PCI. The testing may help to optimize pharmacotherapy effectiveness by providing individualized treatment to the Chinese population.

      " Abstract: We survey 1050 consumers who have just redeemed one or more open loop gift certificates to learn whether they view gift certificate income, cash gifts and non-gift income as substitutes. We find that the majority (83%) of recipients spend the certificates in the same way as cash. The other respondents (17%) bought an item they would not have bought otherwise but adjustments in their shopping pattern do not seem to result from constraints in redeeming the certificates: 80% of all respondents in this group says they have used the certificate to buy an item they really love to have. While inconsistent with standard microeconomic demand theory, this behavior can be explained by narrow bracketing: in spending gift certificates, these consumers consider a limited choice set of nice, personal items. Our data show that females are more likely to narrow bracket gift certificate income and that positive reciprocity towards the giver induces narrow bracketing in case the giver is a household member who suggests to buy a particular item using the certificate.Previous studies have found that both giving in-kind gifts (Waldfogel, 1993) as giving gift cards (Offenberg, 2007) entail a welfare loss of 10-30% when compared to giving cash. We find that the welfare effects of open loop gift certificates among users are limited: the consumption of broad bracketing consumers is unaffected and narrow bracketing consumers seem to value the possibility to separate gift certificate income from other income sources. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: A new mass conservative flux method is presented for the numerical solution of the stochastic collection equation. The method consists of a two-step procedure. In the first step the mass distribution of drops with mass x′ that have been newly formed in a collision process is entirely added to grid box k of the numerical grid mesh with xk ≤ x′ x′ ≤ xk+1. In the second step a certain fraction of the water mass in grid box k is transported to k + 1. This transport is done by means of an advection procedure. Different numerical test runs are presented in which the proposed method is compared with the Berry-Reinhardt scheme. These tests show a very good agreement between the two approaches. In various sensitivity studies it is demonstrated that the flux method remains numerically stable for different choices of the grid mesh and the integration time step. Since a time step of 10 s may be used without significant loss of accuracy, the flux method is numerically very efficient in comparison to the Berry-Reinhardt scheme.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aims: The aims of this study were to examine (1) if associations between gender and psychosocial factors could be explained by socioeconomic status (SES) and (2) if associations between gender and psychosocial factors are more salient at lower levels of SES. Methods: Psychosocial factors such as decision latitude and social integration were studied in a cross-sectional study in two steps. In a public health survey, 4,086 randomly selected men and women aged 30—64 participated. Of these, 257 men and women also participated in an in-depth study. SES was measured in terms of education and occupation. Linear regression models were used to test associations between gender, SES, and a broad range of psychosocial factors. Results: Women reported lower scale scores on decision latitude, coping, and self-esteem, as well as more job strain, depression, and vital exhaustion, while men reported more cynicism (all p<0.05). Observed gender differences were still significant after control for effect of education, while after control for occupational status the effect of gender was lost for decision latitude and job strain. Significant interaction factors were found between gender and educational status for psychological demands, decision latitude, social integration, coping, and hopelessness. Conclusions: Gender differences, found for a broad range of psychosocial factors, could not be explained by SES. However, associations between gender and psychosocial factors were more salient at lower levels of SES. Psychosocial factors, especially decision latitude and social integration, may help explain why women with low SES experience poorer health. © 2006, Sage Publications.

      " Abstract: MEA (microwave endometrial ablation) is a treatment that can control hypermenorrhea. With the increase in the number of caesarean sections and myomectomies, an increasing number of patients with MEA have undergone previous incision of the uterine myometrium. Uterine perforation is major complication. Here we compared the incidence of complications and recurrence between groups with or without previous uterine surgery. 35 patients who underwent MEA were enrolled in the study. We assessed the thickness of uterine myometrium by MRI and transvaginal ultrasonography (TV-US). 12 patients (34%) had previous uterine surgery; Among 12 patients with previous uterine surgery, 6 (50%) showed thinning of the myometrium. No patient showed any complications. There was no difference in recurrence rate between two groups (1/12 = 8% and 2/23 = 8%, respectively). MEA can be performed safely and effectively even for patients with previous uterine surgery.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? MEA (microwave endometrial ablation) is a treatment that can control hypermenorrhea.A few serious complications have been reported, including uterine perforation and intestinal injury. There have been no collective reports on women with a history of uterine surgery, and the decision to perform MEA and the detailed procedures have not been clarified. What do the results of this study add? No patient who received MEA showed any complication regardless of previous uterine surgery. There was no difference in recurrence rate of hypermenorrhea between groups with and without previous uterine surgery.

Curently, with the increase in the number of caesarean sections and myomectomies, the increasing number of patients with MEA have undergone previous incision of the uterine myometrium and this causes thinning of the myometrium.

      " Abstract: Background: In mainland China, patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have approximately an 40% prevalence of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). This disease leads to recurrent retinal pigment epithelium detachment (PED), extensive subretinal or vitreous hemorrhages, and severe vision loss. China has introduced various treatment modalities in the past years and gained comprehensive experience in treating PCV. Methods: A total of 14 retinal specialists nationwide with expertise in PCV were empaneled to prioritize six questions and address their corresponding outcomes, regarding opinions on inactive PCV, choices of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) monotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) monotherapy or combined therapy, patients with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) or intraretinal fluid (IRF) after loading dose anti-VEGF, and patients with massive subretinal hemorrhage. An evidence synthesis team conducted systematic reviews, which informed the recommendations that address these questions. This guideline used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach to assess the certainty of evidence and grade the strengths of recommendations. Results: The panel proposed the following six conditional recommendations regarding treatment choices. (1) For patients with inactive PCV, we suggest observation over treatment. (2) For treatment-naive PCV patients, we suggest either anti-VEGF monotherapy or combined anti-VEGF and PDT rather than PDT monotherapy. (3) For patients with PCV who plan to initiate combined anti-VEGF and PDT treatment, we suggest later/rescue PDT over initiate PDT. (4) For PCV patients who plan to initiate anti-VEGF monotherapy, we suggest the treat and extend (T&E) regimen rather than the pro re nata (PRN) regimen following three monthly loading doses. (5) For patients with persistent SRF or IRF on optical coherence tomography (OCT) after three monthly anti-VEGF treatments, we suggest proceeding with anti-VEGF treatment rather than observation. (6) For PCV patients with massive subretinal hemorrhage (equal to or more than four optic disc areas) involving the central macula, we suggest surgery (vitrectomy in combination with tissue-plasminogen activator (tPA) intraocular injection and gas tamponade) rather than anti-VEGF monotherapy.

      " Abstract: To support energy-efficient routing, accurate state information about energy levels should be available. But due to bandwidth constraints, communication costs, high loss rate and the dynamic topology of MANETs, collecting and maintaining up-to-date state information is a very complex task. In this work, we use Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) as the underlying routing protocol and explore the accuracy of state information under different traffic rates. We are focusing on energy level as QoS metric, which has been used for routing decisions in many energy-efficient routing protocol proposals. First, we show that the accuracy of the available nodal energy level does impact the performance of energy-efficient variations of OLSR. If nodes learn other nodes' energy level through protocol messages, fewer packets tend to get delivered in an energy-constrained network, in particular under high traffic loads or in mobile networks. We analyzed the accuracy of the reported energy levels for the static scenarios and found that the propagated values are highly inaccurate, in particular under high traffic rates. Tuning the OLSR protocol parameters has no noticeable impact on accuracy levels. We then propose two additional techniques to increase accuracies and compare the different techniques against each other and against the basic OLSR protocol. One of the techniques, which we call smart prediction, achieves highly accurate perceived energy levels under all traffic loads. We finally show that the proposed smart prediction technique also works well for mobile networks and more heterogeneous wireless interfaces. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base has a poor prognosis, and treatment is accompanied by a number of major problems. In view of this, it is important to recognize which patients will benefit from treatment with curative intent and which treatment method to use. Methods: One hundred sixty-five patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base were identified on our database. Eighty-two patients were treated by radical irradiation, and 41 by surgery. A further 42 patients were considered unsuitable for curative treatment. Results: The 5-year cause-specific survival rate was 41% for those treated by irradiation, 58% for those treated by surgery, and 9% for untreated patients. There was no difference in the efficacy of treatment methods (p = .5362), but a highly significant difference was seen in survival rate between treated and untreated patients (p = .0028). The decision regarding administration of curative treatment was based on the extent of locoregional involvement at the primary site (p = .0139; odds ratio, 0.43) and in the neck (p = .0078; odds ratio, 0.23). No factors affected the decision to treat by irradiation or surgery. When the observed survival rate was calculated, there was no significant difference in 5-year survival rate between treated and untreated patients (p = .2762). Those with early (T1-2) disease at the primary site had an improved survival rate from 0.5 to 4 years compared with those who were untreated (T3-4; p = .0081; odds ratio, 2.2). In addition, those with early (T1-2) disease had a better survival rate than those with advanced cancers (p = .0139; odds ratio, 2.09). There was, however, no difference in survival rate at 5 years. Those with early disease compared with those with advanced disease were twice as likely to be alive at 2 years; however, all survival advantages had disappeared by 5 years. Conclusions: In terms of observed survival, treating tongue base squamous cell carcinoma that is locally advanced (T3-4) at presentation offers no survival advantage over palliation alone. Treating early disease (T1-2) doubles the survival rate for up to 4 years, but by 5 years this survival advantage is lost. The present study finds radiotherapy and surgery to be equivalent at controlling this disease. © 2007 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Freeway-diverging areas are prone to low traffic efficiency, congestion, and frequent accidents. Because of the fluctuation of the surrounding traffic flow distribution, the individual decision-making of vehicles in diverging areas is typically unable to plan a departure trajectory that balances safety and efficiency well. Consequently, it is critical that vehicles in freeway-diverging regions develop a lane-changing driving strategy that strives to improve both the safety and efficiency of divergence areas. For CAV leaving the diverging area, this study suggested a full-time horizon optimum solution. Since it is a dynamic strategy, an MPC system based on rolling time horizon optimization was constructed as the primary algorithm of the strategy. A simulation experiment was created to verify the viability of the proposed methodology based on a mixed-flow environment. The results show that, in comparison with the feasible strategies exiting to off-ramp, the proposed strategy can take over 60% reduction in lost time traveling through a diverging area under the premise of safety and comfort without playing a negative impact on the surrounding traffic flow. Thus, the MPC system designed for the subject vehicle is capable of performing an optimal driving strategy in diverging areas within the full-time and space horizon. © 2023 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the conventional metal extraction process, copper-nickel sulfide ores are generally treated by pyrometallurgical processes, including smelting and converting operation. The purpose of the smelting process is to eliminate most of the iron and to concentrate the valuable metals, such as nickel, copper and platinum group metals, into a low-nickel matte. Then, the remaining iron is oxidized and fluxed for removal as silicate slag in the converting process, and the low-nickel matte is converted into a high-nickel matte. However, a substantial portion of cobalt is also oxidized and converted into the slag phase. Additionally, the subsequent treatment of the high-nickel matte after the grinding and flotation processes is complicated, and leads to the dispersion of noble metals. Usually, the loss of noble metals is about 10% ~ 20%. Direct treatment of low-nickel matte by hydrometallurgical methods instead of the converting process may be a good choice, which will prevent the loss of associated elements, such as cobalt and noble metals. Since copper has a very strong affinity for sulfur, the sulfides of iron, cobalt and nickel may dissolve into the liquid phase (leach liquor) under controlled the acidity of the solution, whereas the cuprous sulfide should remain in the residue. The inert noble metals should concentrate in the cuprous sulfide. However, a large amount of toxic hydrogen sulfide will be released in the leaching process, which can be converted to elemental sulfur by the Claus process. Based on the above considerations, it is possible to develop a method for extracting valuable metals from low-nickel matte and recovering the associated cobalt and noble metals. In this study, the kinetics of the acid leaching process of low-nickel matte under atmospheric pressure was studied. In addition, the effects of the stirring speed, initial sulfuric acid concentration, reaction temperature and particle size on the leaching of nickel were investigated. The kinetic analysis of the leaching data for various experimental conditions indicated that the reaction was controlled by diffusion through an inert porous layer. It was determined that the reaction order was 0.54 with respect to sulfuric acid with an activation energy of 58.3 kJ mol−1. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background. Recipient antidonor cytotoxic T-cell activity has been associated with graft loss and acute rejection in renal allograft recipients. The role of immunologic mechanisms in the development of chronic graft rejection is controversial. We analyzed all living related renal transplants performed at Children's Hospital (Boston, MA) from 1983 to 1995 to assess whether cell-mediated cytotoxicity, determined in vitro and measured before transplantation, was predictive of chronic rejection. Methods. Eighty-three patients were studied retrospectively. Fifty-seven patients with one haplotype-matched renal transplants from living related donors were studied to determine the association between cell-mediated lympholysis (CML) level, acute rejection, chronic rejection, and graft failure. Acute rejection was defined by the decision to treat. Chronic rejection was defined by histology and/or the absolute serum creatinine value using an increasing serum creatinine level >1.0 mg/dl for children less than 3, a creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dl for children between 3 and 10 years of age, and a creatinine level >2.0 mg/dl for children above 10 years of age. Return to dialysis or retransplantation was considered graft failure. Results. Of the 57 haploidentical patients, there were 33 males and 24 females. The mean age at transplant was 11.1 years (SD = 6.7). Twelve patients developed chronic rejection, 24 patients developed acute rejection, and 7 patients had graft failure. Pretransplant cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity was associated with chronic rejection (P = 0.001) and graft failure (P = 0.013) but only marginally with acute rejection (P = 0.058). Controlling for age and sex, Cox's proportional hazards model revealed that CML level was predictive of time to chronic rejection (P<0.01) but not acute rejection (P = 0.11). It was estimated that every 1-unit increase in CML level raises the monthly risk of chronic rejection by 7%. Ten children received HLA, identical kidneys from their siblings. There were no episodes of chronic rejection after 5 years. Two patients with high CML levels had episodes of acute rejection; both patients responded to treatment. Conclusion. Our data demonstrate an association between pretransplant cell-mediated cytotoxicity and the occurrence of chronic rejection in living related one-haploidentical renal transplants in pediatric patients.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We have described 19 genes that affect neural cell lineages and cell fates during the development of C. elegans. These genes differ markedly in the nature, breadth, and specificity of their effects. Their only obvious common characteristic is that they all lack specificity for the nervous system, affecting both neural and nonneural development. For some of these genes (lin-5, lin-6, unc-59, unc-85), this nonspecificity probably reflects a general utilization of their products in cellular replication. In contrast, most of these genes appear to be highly specific in their effects, but their specificity is not on the basis of cell type but rather on the basis of some particular aspect of development. Specifically, unc-83 and unc-84 mutations affect certain precursor cells that generate both neural and nonneural descendants; lin-22 and lin-26 mutants lead to the generation of supernumerary neural cells with a concomitant loss of nonneural cells; lin-4, lin-14, lin-28, and lin-29 mutants perturb global aspects of developmental timing, altering the time of appearance (or preventing the appearance) of both neural and nonneural cells; lin-1, lin-8, lin-9, and lin-15 mutations affect the cell lineages of certain nonneuron -producing ectoblasts in hermaphrodites and of homologous neuron-producing ectoblasts in males; lin-12 mutations affect many sets of nonidentical homologs (cells of similar lineage history that express different fates), only some of which are neural; ced-3 mutations prevent all programmed cell deaths, again only some of which are neural. Of these 19 genes, only unc-86 is specific for neural as opposed to nonneural cell lineages. However, some unc-86 mutants are abnormal in chromosome segregation at meiosis, indicating that this gene also may affect nonneural aspects of development. One implication of these observations is that genes (and molecules) involved in neural development are likely to function in nonneural development as well. The genes lin-22, lin-12, unc-86, and ced-3 may play decision-making roles during C. elegans neurogenesis, as mutations in each of these genes cause specific transformations in the fates of particular cells. These genes and others like them may act within a hierarchy to effect decisions at different levels within cell lineages. For example, lin-22 animals display transformations affecting entire postembryonic cell lineages, unc-86 animals are altered at an intermediate level of certain cell lineages, and ced-3 animals are affected only in the ultimate fates of cells produced by terminal cell divisions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\u001b[0m :\n",

In 4 cases, expanders were placed just under the defect in a fashion to extend 1 to 2 cm more laterally toward the encircling healthy tissue. The expanded tissue was not mobilized for longer distances; thus, there was no loss in flap gain. The resulting final scar was linear or crescentic. In the Alagoz technique, tissue gain similar in size to the defect is sufficient for reconstruction. The simpler the flap, the best the resulting scar. Copyright © 2015 by Mutaz B.

Detecting smell loss in young children can be difficult, since many children with olfactory deficits do not recognize their problem and may even pretend to smell. The short attention span of some young children precludes testing with longer standardized olfactory tests. Currently there is a dearth of pediatric smell tests. In this study we evaluated the performance of 152 children and young adults on a game-like rotating \" Smell Wheel\" odor identification test. This forced-choice test, which can be self-administered, was designed to capture the child's imagination and to provide a standardized test measure with odors known to young children using a minimum number of trials. Method: Thirty 4-5-year olds (10 female), 62 6-7-year olds (17 female), 30 10-11-year olds (18 female) and 30 18-19-year olds (15 female) were tested. Analysis of variance was used to assess the influences of sex and age on the test scores. Results: All participants completed the simple and rapid test protocol. Test performance and age-related changes analogous to those obtained using longer tests were observed. Test scores of participants who self-administered the test were equivalent to those for whom the test was administered by the experimenter.

However, there is limited longitudinal information available about the risk of loss of housing after a successful exit from homelessness. Methods: The study presented here examined the risk and predictors of returning to homelessness after successful housing in a sample of 392 formerly homeless veterans involved in an experimental trial of case management plus rent subsidy vouchers, case management only, or standard care. Results: Over the course of a five-year period, 44% of all participants experienced a period of homelessness for at least one day after successful placement into housing. Cox regression analysis found that participants in the case management plus voucher condition had significantly longer periods of continuous housing, compared with participants in the other two groups. Other predictors of decreased housing tenure were drug use and a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder.

The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and beliefs of Arab Muslim patients with low back pain (LBP) in Bahrain. Methods: We recruited Arab Muslim patients attending physiotherapy with LBP ≥3 months, and ≥18 years of age. Socio-demographic information and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain intensity were collected. Focus groups were conducted between 2013–2014, using pre-determined semi-structured interview questions. Qualitative content analysis was applied with single counting and inclusion of negative instances. Results: 18 participants attended three focus groups (14 females and 4 males) with a mean VAS(SD) = 5.28(±1.97). Five themes were identified; (1) loss of independence, (2)change in identity causes distress, (3) beliefs and attitudes towards low back pain, (4)trying to cope with LBP, and (5)experiences within the healthcare system. Conclusions: Religious and cultural beliefs influenced pain-related beliefs, fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing. We recommend addressing cultural gender roles and using “active” forms of religious coping to inform treatment. Participants’ experiences within and experiences of the healthcare system were similar to Western cultures. This encourages the application of Western findings into practice to facilitate the management of these patients.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION A qualitative exploration was undertaken to explore the experiences of Muslim and/or Arab patients with LBP.

Results: Eleven of 13 maternities visited conducted an average of 6.8 case reviews per year with a total average of 16.7 cases per hospital (range 4-38). Although interviewees confirmed that audits resulted in better quality of care, five hospitals had ceased performing audits altogether and the remainder did them less frequently, because of audit teams encountering staff resistance, insufficient understanding of the audit concept, difficulties in organizing sessions, and lack of administrative support. Insufficient training and external assistance hindered the implementation of complete audit loops, resulting in a loss of staff motivation. Conclusion: Implementing clinical audits as a means to improving quality of care requires a significant investment in training and various kinds of on-going assistance - factors which decision-makers should be aware of. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Current trends show increasing consumer demand for minced meat semi-finished products. According to this tendency it is necessary to produce high quality products with a prolonged shelf life. As a result of the recent North Caucasus Federal University (Stavropol, Russian Federation) research, scientists demonstrated the possibility of alginate-pectin mixtures additives. The additives to meat emulsions enable to produce high-quality ground meat convenience food with high emulsions stability under low-temperature treatment. Currently convenience meat products are one of the top consumer choices both in Russia and in the EU. That’s why it was decided to make a cooperative experimental research of scientists from North Caucasus Federal University and Max Rubner-Institut (Kulmbach, Germany,) to produce a new kind of hamburger patty with alginate-pectin meat emulsion. The goal was to achieve a tenderer, more stable and safer product with high organoleptic value. The article contains results of main measurements which were done after a complex investigation of the developed product using methods of evaluation of rheological and mechanical properties, pH and weight losses, TBARS, Water activity and analysis of chemical content and sensory indexes. Having analyzed all the measurements data and compared discussed results, it was determined, that experimental hamburger with developed emulsion had the best quality and safety properties. The authors concluded that development of protein- anionic polysaccharide system in emulsions for semi-finished products like pectin-alginate complex with whey protein concentrate will inhibits lipids oxidation, improves tenderness and permits preservation quality of products. © 2019, Consulting and Training Center - KEY.

      " Abstract: Unary inclusion dependencies are database constraints expressing subset relationships. The decidability of implication for these dependencies together with embedded implicational dependencies, such as functional dependencies, are investigated. As shown by Casanova et al., the unrestricted and finite implication problems are different for the class of functional and unary inclusion dependencies; also, for this class and for any fixed k, finite implication has no k-ary complete axiomatization. For both of these problems, complete axiomatizations and polynomial-time decision procedures are provided: linear time for unrestricted implication and cubic time for finite implication. It follows that functional and unary inclusion dependencies form a semantically natural class of first-order sentences with equality, which although not finitely controllable, is efficiently solvable and docile. Generalizing from these results, it is shown that the interaction between functionaland inclusion dependencies characterizes: 1990 unrestricted implication of unary inclusion and all embedded implicational dependencies; (2) finite implication of unary inclusion and all full implicational dependencies; (3) finite implication of unary inclusion and all embedded tuple-generating dependencies. As a direct consequence of this analysis, most of the applications of dependency implication are extended, within polynomial-time, to database design problems involving unary inclusion dependencies. Such examples are tests for lossless joins and tests for complementarity of projective views. Finally, if one additionally requires that. © 1990, ACM. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: NMDA receptors become a major contributor to acute ethanol intoxication effects at high concentrations as ethanol binds to a unique site on the receptor and inhibits glutamatergic activity in multiple brain areas. Although a convincing body of literature exists on the ability of NMDA receptor antagonists to mimic and worsen cellular and behavioral ethanol effects, receptor agonists have been less well-studied. In addition to a primary agonist site for glutamate, the NMDA receptor contains a separate co-agonist site that responds to endogenous amino acids glycine and . d-serine. . d-serine is both selective for this co-agonist site and potent in boosting NMDA dependent activity even after systemic administration. In this study, we hypothesized that exogenous . d-serine might ameliorate some acute ethanol behaviors by opposing NMDA receptor inhibition. We injected adult male C57 mice with a high concentration of . d-serine at various time windows relative to ethanol administration and monitored sedation, motor coordination and voluntary ethanol drinking. . d-serine (2.7 g/kg, ip) prolonged latency to a loss of righting reflex (LoRR) and shortened LoRR duration when given 15 min before ethanol (3 g/kg) but not when it was injected with or shortly after ethanol. Blood samples taken at sedative recovery and at fixed time intervals revealed no effect of . d-serine on ethanol concentration but an ethanol-induced decrease in . l-serine and glycine content was prevented by acute . d-serine pre-administration. . d-serine had no effect on ethanol-induced (2 g/kg) rotarod deficits in young adult animals but independently and interactively degraded motor performance in a subset of older mice. Finally, a week-long series of daily ip injections resulted in a 50% decrease in free choice ethanol preference for . d-serine treated animals compared to saline-injected controls in a two-bottle choice experiment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..\u001b[0m :\n",

Background: With the increasing accessibility of portable, economical, video-based eye trackers such as the EyeTribe, there is growing interest in these devices for eye movement recordings, particularly in the domain of sports-related concussion. However, prior to implementation there is a primary need to establish the validity of these devices. One current limitation of portable eye trackers is their sampling rate (30–60 samples per second, or Hz), which is typically well below the benchmarks achieved by their research-grade counterparts (e.g., the EyeLink, which samples at 500–2000 Hz). Methods: We compared video-oculographic measurements made using the EyeTribe with those of the EyeLink during a digitized rapid number naming task (the King-Devick test) in a convenience sample of 30 controls. Results: EyeTribe had loss of signal during recording, and failed to reproduce the typical shape of saccadic main sequence relationships. In addition, EyeTribe data yielded significantly fewer detectable saccades and displayed greater variance of inter-saccadic intervals than the EyeLink system. Conclusion: Caution is advised prior to implementation of low-resolution eye trackers for objective saccade assessment and sideline concussion screening. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper studies a coordination issue with two ordering opportunities in a two-echelon supply chain, where one manufacturer sells a single newsvendor-type product through one buyer. The manufacturer does not hold inventory and activates production or order with an infinite capacity and a fixed setup cost in response to the buyers order. The buyer places two orderings during the selling period of the product: one happens at the beginning of the period and the other at some specified time within the selling period. The whole selling period is divided into two stages or sub-periods by the buyers second order. The stochastic demands in the two sub-periods are assumed to be auto-correlated. The excess demand before the second order is partially backordered, whereas the excess demand at the end of the selling season is utterly lost. Under both the centralized and decentralized settings, we develop the models of how the buyer determines his two-ordering policies. We analyse the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solutions to the models and present the corresponding analytical solutions. Furthermore, we propose an improved revenue-sharing contract that can realize the perfect coordination of the supply chain and study how the revenue-sharing policies affect the supply chain members decisions.

      " Abstract: Thanks to infrared thermography, we have studied the mechanisms of CO 2 capture by solid adsorbents (CO2 capture via gas adsorption on various types of porous substrates) to better understand the physico-chemical mechanisms that control CO2-surface interactions. In order to develop in the future an efficient process for post-combustion CO 2 capture, it is necessary to quantify the energy of adsorption of the gas on the adsorbent (exothermic process). The released heat (heat of adsorption) is a key parameter for the choice of materials and for the design of capture processes. Infrared thermography is used, at first approach, to detect the temperature fields on a thin-layer of adsorbent during CO2 adsorption. An analytical heat transfer model was developed to evaluate the adsorption heat flux and to estimate, via an inverse technique, the heat of adsorption. The main originality of our method is to estimate heat losses directly from the heat generated during the adsorption process. Then, the estimated heat loss is taken for an a posteriori calculation of the adsorption heat flux. Finally, the heat of adsorption may be estimated. The interest in using infrared thermography is also its ability to quickly change the experimental setup, for example, to switch from the adsorbent thin-layer to the adsorbent bed configuration. We present the first results tempting to link the thin-layer data to the propagation speed of the thermal front in a millifluidics adsorption bed, also observed by IR thermography. © 2014 AFM, EDP Sciences .\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: Emergency cervical cerclage is often considered a controversial salvage measure for those pregnancies at high risk of mid-trimester loss or early preterm birth. To determine the efficacy and benefit of emergency cerclage insertion, we assessed the predictive value of quantitative fetal fibronectin (fFN) concentration in cervicovaginal fluid for spontaneous preterm birth in women with exposed fetal membranes prior to cerclage insertion. Study design: This was a retrospective observational study from St Thomas’ Hospital, London of a cohort of women with singleton pregnancy and exposed fetal membranes presenting between 18 and 23+6 weeks of gestation (n = 35), in the period 2015-2018. fFN concentrations in cervicovaginal fluid were measured quantitatively at presentation in all women within 24 h prior to cerclage insertion. Results: 35 eligible women with exposed fetal membranes who underwent an emergency cervical cerclage were identified. The median gestational age was 20 + 0 weeks (18 + 6−21 + 2) at presentation and 29 + 3 weeks (23 + 3−38 + 2) at delivery, with a median time from emergency cerclage to delivery of 65.5 days (17–126.5). In total, 12 women (34 %) delivered within 28 days of emergency cerclage insertion. 60 % of women with an fFN level above 500 ng/mL delivered within 28 days of cerclage insertion, and they all delivered before 37 weeks gestation. No women with fFN levels below 10 ng/mL delivered within 28 days and 75 % of these women delivered at term. Concentration of quantitative fFN at presentation correlated negatively with time to delivery (Spearman's rs = −0.52, p = 0.0016). Mann–Whitney U analysis demonstrated a significant difference in the distribution of qfFN concentrations in women who delivered preterm compared to those who did not, both within 28 days from testing (p = 0.0048) and <37 weeks (p = 0.006). Conclusion: Quantitative fFN has a role in predicting spontaneous preterm birth even in women with exposed fetal membranes undergoing emergency cervical cerclage. Given the serious risks associated with cervical cerclage surgery, qfFN could be used to counsel these patients at high risk of preterm delivery, as well as assisting in the decision to insert a cerclage. © 2020\u001b[0m :\n",

Ss were 54 male undergraduates. Results showed that mean search increased with H and was at a consistently higher level for high-importance conditions. There were no observable differences in the effects of gain and loss manipulations of I. The predicted multiplicative relationship between H and I failed to occur, but rather an additive effect was indicated. Post hoc analysis of H in high- and low-importance conditions suggested that this additive effect was a function of increases in H induced by I conditions. It appears that importance effects are in part mediated by uncertainty. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1968 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The assessment of the Seismic Resilience (SR) has become a fundamental issue in Structural Engineering to ensure rapid and efficient recovery to earthquake scenarios. Even if there are methodologies that assess SR, most of them are significantly time-consuming. In this paper, a framework for simplified assessments of SR is proposed based on the existing literature. The probability-based method of fragility curves is applied to estimate the losses and a novel definition of the recovery model is herein proposed. A case study is discussed to apply the proposed framework to two configurations: a fixed-base and a base-isolated structural system. The state-of-the-art platform Opensees has been applied to calculate the non-linear performance of the structures. The longitudinal drift ratio was chosen as the representative parameter to develop fragility curves and thus to quantify SR. The response of the 200 analyses (100 for each system) shows the benefit of applying base isolation technique in terms of SR, used as a comprehensive parameter to compare the two solutions. The proposed approach may be helpful for many stakeholders and decision makers for pre- and post-earthquake assessments. © 2023 Institution of Structural Engineers\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Driving cessation for some older adults can exacerbate physical, cognitive, and mental health challenges due to loss of independence and social isolation. Fully autonomous vehicles may offer an alternative transport solution, increasing social contact and encouraging independence. However, there are gaps in understanding the impact of older adults’ passive role on safe human–vehicle interaction, and on their well-being. 37 older adults (mean age ± SD = 68.35 ± 8.49 years) participated in an experiment where they experienced fully autonomous journeys consisting of a distinct stop (an unexpected event versus an expected event). The autonomous behavior of the vehicle was achieved using the Wizard of Oz approach. Subjective ratings of trust and reliability, and driver state monitoring including visual attention strategies (fixation duration and count) and physiological arousal (skin conductance and heart rate), were captured during the journeys. Results revealed that subjective trust and reliability ratings were high after journeys for both types of events. During an unexpected stop, overt visual attention was allocated toward the event, whereas during an expected stop, visual attention was directed toward the human–machine interface (HMI) and distributed across the central and peripheral driving environment. Elevated skin conductance level reflecting increased arousal persisted only after the unexpected event. These results suggest that safety-critical events occurring during passive fully automated driving may narrow visual attention and elevate arousal mechanisms. To improve in-vehicle user experience for older adults, a driver state monitoring system could examine such psychophysiological indices to evaluate functional state and well-being. This information could then be used to make informed decisions on vehicle behavior and offer reassurance during elevated arousal during unexpected events. © Copyright © 2020 Stephenson, Eimontaite, Caleb-Solly, Morgan, Khatun, Davis and Alford.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this study, state-level US data for the years 2000 and 1990 are used to provide additional evidence on the roles of income inequality and poverty in population health. Five main points are noted. First, contrary to the suggestion made in several recent studies, the income inequality parameter is observed to be quite robust and carries statistical significance in mortality equations estimated from several observation sets and a fairly wide variety of specificational choices. Second, the evidence does not indicate that significance of income inequality is lost when education variables are included. Third, similarly, the income inequality parameter shows significance when a race variable is added, and also when both race and urbanization terms are entered. Fourth, while poverty is seen to have some mortality-increasing consequence, the role of income inequality appears stronger. Fifth, income inequality retains statistical significance when a quadratic income term is added and also if the log-log version of a fairly inclusive model is estimated. I therefore suggest that the recent skepticism articulated by several scholars in regard to the robustness of the income inequality parameters in mortality equations estimated from the US data should be reconsidered. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

      " Abstract: Several factors render carotenoid determination inherently difficult. Thus, in spite of advances in analytical instrumentation, discrepancies in quantitative results on carotenoids can be encountered in the international literature. A good part of the errors comes from the pre-chromatographic steps such as: sampling scheme that does not yield samples representative of the food lots under investigation; sample preparation which does not maintain representativity and guarantee homogeneity of the analytical sample; incomplete extraction; physical losses of carotenoids during the various steps, especially during partition or washing and by adsorption to glass walls of containers; isomerization and oxidation of carotenoids during analysis. On the other hand, although currently considered the method of choice for carotenoids, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is subject to various sources of errors, such as: incompatibility of the injection solvent and the mobile phase, resulting in distorted or split peaks; erroneous identification; unavailability, impurity and instability of carotenoid standards; quantification of highly overlapping peaks; low recovery from the HPLC column; errors in the preparation of standard solutions and in the calibration procedure; calculation errors.

      " Abstract: Increasingly drastic global change is expected to cause hydroclimatic changes, which will influence vegetation productivity and pose a threat to the terrestrial carbon sink. Asymmetry represents an imbalance between vegetation growth and loss of growth during dry and wet periods, respectively. However, the mechanisms of asymmetric plant responses to hydrological changes remain poorly understood. Here, we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of asymmetric responses of vegetation productivity across terrestrial ecosystems in China. We analyzed several observational and satellite-based datasets of plant productivity and several reanalyzed datasets of hydroclimatic variables from 2001 to 2020, and used a random forest model to assess the importance of hydroclimatic variables for these responses. Our results showed that the productivity of >50 % of China's vegetated areas showed a more positive asymmetry (2.3 ± 9.4 %) over the study period, which were distributed broadly in northwest China (mainly grasslands and sparse vegetation ecosystems). Negative asymmetries were most common in forest ecosystems in northeast China. We demonstrated that one-third of vegetated areas tended to exhibit significant changes in asymmetry during 2001–2020. The trend towards stronger positive asymmetry (0.95 % yr−1) was higher than that towards stronger negative asymmetry (−0.55 % yr−1), which is beneficial for the carbon sink. We further showed that in China, soil moisture was a more important driver of spatiotemporal changes in asymmetric productivity than precipitation. We identified thresholds of surface soil moisture (20–30 %, volume water content) and root-zone soil moisture (200–350 mm, equivalent water height) that were associated with changes in asymmetry. Our findings highlight the necessity of considering the dynamic responses of vegetation to hydrological factors in order to fully understand the physiological growth processes of plants and avoid the possible loss of productivity due to future climate change. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

The present study was aimed to correlate rTBV to the angiogenic markers and EGFR expression in oligodendroglial tumors with 1p/19q LOH or 1p LOH (Group 1) and 1p19q intact alleles or 19q LOH (Group 2), respectively. In WHO grade II neoplasms, Group 1 showed significantly greater rTBV than Group 2 (P = 0.013). However, the differences between Group 1 and Group 2 were not significant in grade III tumors. Probe-based real-time RT-PCR analyses showed that 12% of Group 2 high-grade tumors with intact 1p19q exhibited dramatic EGFR overexpression (designated EGFR-high). Grade III neoplasms showed a significantly higher rTBV than grade II neoplasms. Group 1 tumors showed significantly higher rTBV than Group 2 tumors, independent of the EGFR-high subtype. Real-time RT-PCR analyses showed increased expression of VEGF, CD31 and CD105 in Group 1 tumors as compared to Group 2 tumors, excluding the EGFR-high subtype. Multivariable linear regression analysis showed a significant association of rTBV with 1p19q LOH, and expression of EGFR and VEGF. Therefore, the combined use of extensive molecular profiling and advanced MR imaging modalities may improve the accuracy of tumor grading, provide prognostic information, and has the potential to influence treatment decisions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2009.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are thought to be prevalent regulators of gene expression, but the consequences of lncRNA inactivation invivo are mostly unknown. Here, we show that targeted deletion of mouse Hotair lncRNA leads to derepression of hundreds of genes, resulting in homeotic transformation of the spine and malformation of metacarpal-carpal bones. RNA sequencing and conditional inactivation reveal an ongoing requirement of Hotair to repress HoxD genes and several imprinted loci such as Dlk1-Meg3 and Igf2-H19 without affecting imprinting choice. Hotair binds to both Polycomb repressive complex 2, which methylates histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27), and Lsd1 complex, which demethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) invivo. Hotair inactivation causes H3K4me3 gain and, to a lesser extent, H3K27me3 loss at target genes. These results reveal the function and mechanisms of Hotair lncRNA in enforcing a silent chromatin state at Hox and additional genes\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract:                              Brazil has extensive forests and savannas on deep weathered soils and plays a key role in the discussions about carbon sequestration, but the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks up to 1 m depth has not been investigated in Brazil using machine learning techniques. In this study, we applied a methodological framework to optimize the prediction of SOC stocks for the entire Brazilian territory and determine how the environmental heterogeneity of Brazil influences the SOC stocks distribution. We used a legacy dataset of 8227 soil profiles which consisted of 37,693 samples. For each profile, the vertical distribution of SOC and bulk density were interpolated to standard depths (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60 and 60–100 cm) using mass preserving equal-area quadratic splines. The covariates database was composed of 74 variables including bioclimatic (temperature and precipitation) data, soil and biome maps, vegetation indexes and morphometric maps derived from a digital elevation model, with a 1 km spatial resolution. To obtain the best prediction performance, we tested four machine learning algorithms: Random Forests, Cubist, Generalized Linear Model Boosting and Support Vector Machines. Random Forests showed the best performance in predicting SOC stocks for all depths, with the highest performance at 30–60 cm for training (R                             2                              = 0.32) and validation (R                             2                              = 0.33); hence, it was selected for the spatial prediction of SOC stocks. The most important covariates selected by Random Forests using the recursive feature elimination were: soil class, sum of monthly mean temperature (SAMT), precipitation, slope height and vegetation indexes (NDVI, GPP). In total, Brazilian soils store approximately 71.3 PgC within the top 100 cm, where the first 0–30 cm contains almost 36 PgC. Approximately 31% of the total SOC stocks (22.2 PgC) occurs in protected areas (2.6 million km                             2                             ), which are not subjected to land use pressure and carbon losses. Although the Amazon biome has the highest amount of stored SOC (36.1 PgC), its soils do not represent a good potential for carbon accumulation. Among soil classes, the Luvisols showed the lowest SOC density (6.45 kg m                             −2                             ) and the Histosols presented the highest values (14.87 kg m                             −2                             ). More than 57% of the total SOC was found in nutrient-poor, deep-weathered Ferralsols and Acrisols, which are the dominant soils in Brazil. The presented methodological framework covers all steps of prediction process, building maps with known accuracy and has great potential to be used in future soil carbon inventories at large scales. Concerning conservation issues, the results highlight the importance of nature reserves for protecting SOC in the long-term.                          © 2019 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Tropolone makes the nncleal body on the groupe of Cycloheptatrienolone which is one type of insaturated cycloheptatriene compounds. Some of the derivatives from these, for example, – Colchicin in 1932, Hinokitiol in 1936 – had been extracted from the botanical tissue since quite a long ago, and because of its peculiar characteristics the studies concerning the presence of the biological effect so well as the chemical and physical research of these compounds had been strongly demanded. And then, the decision of the chemical construction of Tropolone and the artificialy build up of Tropolone and its derivatives became possible only in recent years (between 19-48 and 1950). 1, I have tried to make clear the biological effect of this new compound, and then, as the first step, I have made the reference investigation in order to obtain the whole picture of chemical and physical characters of this compound. That is as follows. 1) Tropolone compound is one kind of cycloheptatrienolone which is one type of insaturated cycloheptatriene compounds. Tropolone is a nucleal body of these compounds. 2) However, Tropolone and its derivatives belong to the insaturated cyclotriene compound, they have quite a stable characteristics chemicaly together with the semiaromatic character. According to the condition of the reaction it is possible, that nucleus may electrified both electropositive and electronegative. Therefore semetimes it may react acidity and other timos as alkaline, and even it is possible to create great difference in their reaction direction. 3) In order to be the flat heptatrien and the ring strain which is caused upon the construction of the Tropolone kern the flatness of the kern may be lost due to the cubic disturbance which is caused by the far greater cubic result in comparison with the Benzen Kern. And because of this it is assumed that this will bring a great change in the insaturated electron system and will influence greatly to the chemical and physical characteristics. 4) Tropolone group have the strong mutual action toward some substances, because of this construction of having, such characteristics. Therefore, it is understood that some of the Tropolone group give the spectacular biological effect. 5) Therefore not only from the standpoint of pure chemical or pure physical science, Tropolone group in recent days are investigated from various points of view such as biology, biochemistry, or heredity especially for application of it forr chemical treatment against cancer and others. This is valuable of attention. 6) However, I can find the very few investigations about the biological effect of Tropolone itself. © 1953, Japanese Society of National Medical Services.

      " Abstract: For humans, visual tracking of moving stimuli often triggers catch-up saccades during smooth pursuit. The switch between these continuous and discrete eye movements is a trade-off between tolerating sustained position error (PE) when no saccade is triggered or a transient loss of vision during the saccade due to saccadic suppression. de Brouwer et al. (2002b) demonstrated that catch-up saccades were less likely to occur when the target re-crosses the fovea within 40–180 ms. To date, there is no mechanistic explanation for how the trigger decision is made by the brain. Recently, we proposed a stochastic decision model for saccade triggering during visual tracking (Coutinho et al., 2018) that relies on a probabilistic estimate of predicted PE (PEpred). Informed by model predictions, we hypothesized that saccade trigger time length and variability will increase when pre-saccadic predicted errors are small or visual uncertainty is high (e.g., for blurred targets). Data collected from human participants performing a double step-ramp task showed that large pre-saccadic PEpred (>10°) produced short saccade trigger times regardless of the level of uncertainty while saccade trigger times preceded by small PEpred (~10°) significantly increased in length and variability, and more so for blurred targets. Our model also predicted increased signal-dependent noise (SDN) as retinal slip (RS) increases; in our data, this resulted in longer saccade trigger times and more smooth trials without saccades. In summary, our data supports our hypothesized predicted error-based decision process for coordinating saccades during smooth pursuit. © 2020 Nachmani et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The positive effect of nitrogen fertilization in agriculture inevitably increases residual nitrogen losses. Water pollution led to legal restrictions of some farm practices within the framework of the Nitrates Directive of the EU. Nevertheless, even several decades later, the situation has not improved significantly. We present a possible science-based explanation of such a state and provide it to farmers and government as a support for environmental management settings. This study aimed to compare an established approach to implementing the Nitrates Directive, specifically the climate-based zoning of nitrogen fertilization restrictions using data from the mid-20th century. We evaluated this approach by juxtaposing the initial climate data with more recent data spanning from 1991 to 2020. Subsequently, we examined this zoning framework from the perspective of the non-vegetative period, characterized by temperatures below 5 °C, which is widely acknowledged as a critical threshold for nitrogen intake by plants. We found out that i) the employed climate-born zoning does not correspond to recent climate data; ii) nonvegetation period is longer than nitrogen fertilization restrictions. Therefore, despite a noteworthy 22 day reduction in the nonvegetation period from 1961/1962 to 2019/2020, we cast doubt on the notion that the period limiting nitrogen fertilizer application should also be shortened, while admitting that there are other abiotic and biotic factors affecting nitrogen behaviour within the ecosystem. © 2024 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Population bottlenecks can reduce genetic diversity and may lead to inbreeding depression. However, some studies have provided evidence that long lifespans buffer negative genetic effects of bottlenecks. Others have cautioned that longevity might merely mask the effects of genetic drift, which will still affect long-term population viability. We used microsatellite data from actual populations of tuatara (Sphenodon punctatus) and eastern massasaugas (Sistrurus catenatus) as a starting point for simulated population declines to evaluate the performance of bottleneck tests under a range of scenarios. We quantified losses in genetic diversity for each scenario and assessed the power of commonly used tests (i.e., M-ratio, heterozygosity excess, and mode-shift) to detect known bottlenecks in these moderate-to long-lived species. Declines in genetic diversity were greater in bottlenecks simulated for eastern massasaugas, the shorter-lived species, and mode-shift and heterozygosity excess tests were more sensitive to population declines in this species. Conversely, M-ratio tests were more sensitive to bottlenecks simulated in tuatara. Despite dramatic simulated population declines, heterozygosity excess and mode-shift tests often failed to detect bottlenecks in both species, even when large losses in genetic diversity had occurred (both allelic diversity and heterozygosity). While not eliminating type II error, M-ratio tests generally performed best and were most reliable when a critical value (Mc) of 0.68 was used. However, in tuatara simulations, M-ratio tests had high rates of type I error when Mc was calculated assuming θ = 10. Our results suggest that reliance on these tests could lead to misguided species management decisions.  © 2021 The American Genetic Association. 2021. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Materials and methods: A retrospective review was conducted of patients with pertrochanteric fractures treated between January 2011 and June 2012. In all 80 patients were enrolled in the study, of which 40 were treated with short PFNA and the remaining with long PFNA. Comparative analyses of demographic data, peri-operative outcome and complications were carried out. Results: There was no significant difference noted in the two groups with regards to Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Osteosynthesefragen (AO) fracture classification, time from injury to surgery, blood transfusion post surgery and hospital stay. The surgical duration for a short PFNA procedure was significantly less (58 minutes) when compared to that of a long PFNA (87 minutes). Similarly intra-operative blood loss was significantly higher in the long PFNA group as compared to the short PFNA. Conclusions: A relatively quicker surgical time of just under an hour, lesser blood loss and better learning curve with trainee surgeons make short PFNA a better implant choice in the treatment of pertrochanteric fractures. © 2016, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association.

The number of moths caught in traps is highly skewed and, with respect to Poisson and Hermite distributions, over-dispersed.

      " Abstract: Dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI) is a genetic disorder affecting the structural integrity of the dentin that can result in weakened dentin. The affected teeth, especially posterior teeth, often need to be extracted due to severe wear or fracture. This frequently yields a loss of posterior occlusion and occlusal vertical dimension. Besides wear and fracture, anterior teeth often have an unesthetic appearance because of discoloration. Current treatments of choice, including composite bonding restorations and, more recently, all-ceramic restorations, are typically suggested to preserve the remaining teeth and tooth structure. However, there are a limited number of studies on dental implants in patients with DI. The effectiveness of dentin bonding and dental implants in patients with DI is not known. This clinical report describes a 32-year-old Asian woman with DI who underwent full-mouth rehabilitation. The posterior occlusion, mostly in the molar areas, was restored with dental implants and ceramometal restorations. The anterior teeth and premolars were restored with bonded lithium disilicate glass-ceramic pressed veneers and crowns made with computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing. This case demonstrates that restoring functional occlusion and esthetics for a patient with DI can be completed successfully using contemporary implant therapy and adhesive dentistry. © 2014, Allen Press Inc.

      " Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to building corridors in spatial conservation prioritization. The underlying working principle is the use of a penalty structure in an iterative algorithm used for producing a spatial priority ranking. The penalty term aims to prevent loss or degradation of structural connections, or, equivalently, to promote to a higher rank landscape elements that are required to keep networks connected. The proposed method shows several convenient properties: (1) it does not require a priori specification of habitat patches, end points or related thresholds, (2) it does not rely on resistance coefficients for different habitats, (3) it does not require species targets, and (4) the cost of additional connectivity via corridors can be quantified in terms of habitat quality lost across species. Corridor strength and width parameters control the trade-off between increased structural connectivity via corridors and other considerations relevant to conservation planning. Habitat suitability or dispersal suitability layers used in the analysis can be species specific, thus allowing analysis both in terms of structural and functional connectivity. The proposed method can also be used for targeting habitat restoration, by identifying areas of low habitat quality included in corridors. These methods have been implemented in the Zonation software, and can be applied to large scale and high resolution spatial prioritization, effectively integrating corridor design and spatial conservation prioritization. Since the method operates on novel principles and combines with a large number of features already operational in Zonation, we expect it to be of utility in spatial conservation planning. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations are broadly distributed, occupy a variety of habitats, and have demographic rates that are heterogeneous through space and time. Dynamics of turkey populations are sensitive to the magnitude of fall either-sex harvest, yet there have been few attempts to study performance of fall harvests systematically across a range of plausible demographic scenarios. Thus robustness of existing recommendations to structural uncertainty in population dynamics is marginally understood. We used a stochastic, sex-specific theta-logistic model to simulate performance of fall harvests (0–15%) across scenarios representing uncertainty about current rates of population productivity (3 levels), female losses during spring hunting (2 levels), and spring male harvest (3 levels), with uncertainty in the strength of density dependence as a common attribute. We demonstrated that performance of previously recommended fall harvests was not robust to changes in demographic parameters that occur within and among populations, and thus previous management recommendations may not be appropriate for all regions. Fall harvest rates capable of maintaining large populations with high probability varied from 0–6% with changes to population productivity, when median male and female spring harvests were 30% and 5%, respectively. In general, risks and management tradeoffs accompanying fall harvests were tightly linked to assumed values of population parameters, where changes to productivity and female loss had particularly strong effects on management outcomes. Specifically, reduced productivity or increased female loss decreased the ability to maintain large populations for a given fall harvest rate. Thus, fall harvest recommendations deduced from models that considered only a small portion of the demographic parameter space may not meet modern management objectives over a broader range of conditions. Moreover, our results suggest that future management could be improved by reducing structural uncertainty about turkey demography to allow for region-specific harvest strategies, or by using decision-theoretic approaches to identify harvest strategies that are robust to uncertainty about population parameters. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Prediction plays a vital role in the active distribution network voltage regulation under the high penetration of photovoltaics. Current prediction models aim at minimizing individual prediction errors but overlook their collective impacts on downstream decision-making. Hence, this paper proposes a safety-aware semi-end-to-end coordinated decision model to bridge the gap from the downstream voltage regulation to the upstream multiple prediction models in a coordinated differential way. The semi-end-to-end model maps the input features to the optimal var decisions via prediction, decision-making, and decision-evaluating layers. It leverages the neural network and the second-order cone program (SOCP) to formulate the stochastic PV/load predictions and the var decision-making/evaluating separately. Then the var decision quality is evaluated via the weighted sum of the power loss for economy and the voltage violation penalty for safety, denoted by regulation loss. Based on the regulation loss and prediction errors, this paper proposes the hybrid loss and hybrid stochastic gradient descent algorithm to back-propagate the gradients of the hybrid loss with respect to multiple predictions for enhancing decision quality. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed model with lower power loss for economy and lower voltage violation rate for safety awareness.  © 2010-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: The incidence of cancer patients with bone metastasis is increasing annually. With the advancement of medical treatment for malignant tumors, the survival time of patients with spinal metastases is gradually being prolonged, and adjacent segment vertebral metastases often occur after conventional pedicle screw (CPS) surgery, leading to spinal instability, pain and nerve function injury again, with repeated symptoms. Combined pedicle screw fixation can maintain or reconstruct the spinal stability. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of cement-augmented fenestrated pedicle screws in the posterior approach for spinal metastases by comparing with CPS. Methods: From January 2017 to August 2019, 52 patients with spinal metastases who underwent separation surgery and internal fixation via posterior approach were retrospectively enrolled. Cases were divided into the cement-augmented pedicle screw (CAPS) group (28 cases) and the CPS group (24 cases). The baseline data [age, gender, surgical sites, surgical segment, Tomita classification, Tomita score, Tokuhashi score, spinal instability neoplastic score (SINS)], surgical information, and local progression-free survival (PFS) time were compared between the two groups. Every patient was followed-up every 3 months with imaging examination. The visual analog scale (VAS) score and Frankel grade of the two groups were recorded before and 3 months after the operation were used to evaluate the efficacy. The operation time, the amount of intraoperative blood loss, the amount of bone cement injected in the pedicle screw group, and the complications of the surgery were recorded to evaluate the safety of CAPS. Results: The baseline characteristics were comparable between the two group. Compared with the CPS group, the CAPS group showed significantly longer operation time (163±20 vs. 138±18 min, P<0.001) and lower VAS scores (2.93±1.33 vs. 4.17±1.34, P=0.002). Adjacent segment vertebral metastasis occurred in 10 cases (2 in the CAPS group and 8 in the CPS group, P=0.017). Internal implant failure occurred in 8 cases (1 in the CAPS group and 7 in the CPS group, P=0.011). Compared with the CPS group, the CAPS group had a significantly longer local PFS time (P<0.05).

      " Abstract: The conversion of the 4-oxo-2-benzoyl-l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carbolines la and lb, respectively, into their corresponding 4-amino-β-carbolines 2a and 2b was effected in 70% yield in refluxing hydrazine. In contrast, phenylhydrazine, when heated with the 4-oxo derivative lb, gave the pyridodiindole 18a. This compound derives its origin from an initial Fischer indole cyclization, followed by loss of the 2-benzoyl group and aromatization to the β-carboline. During investigation of the scope and mechanism of this new amination-oxidation reaction, it was found that an acidic hydrogen atom (position 2, NH)γ to the carbonyl group (C-4) was necessary to drive the reaction to completion. Although phenylhydrazones such as 20b and 20c, which carry electron-withdrawing groups, led to the formation of 2b at the expense of the Fischer indole products 18b and 18c, respectively, the yields in this sequence were only moderate. Hydrazine, consequently, appears to be the reagent of choice to effect this amination-oxidation reaction since Fischer indole cyclization cannot compete in this process. © 1987, American Chemical Society.

The differences in equipment capability and reliability is understood by reviewing the process specifications and conducting equipment evaluations. The selection of a process equipment is made by knowing the equipment price and its ability to deliver process requirements. A correct decision of cost effective equipment selection is made to eliminate operation losses during a process and its production time. The understanding of an equipment supplier is done by engineering investigations that include spare parts, service, technical support, advanced process development, and billing management.

      " Abstract: Background: Frailty is a syndrome where the ability to cope with acute physiological stress is compromised, although it is unclear what impact this stress has on long-term outcomes. Vascular-Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity is a validated method for calculating levels of stress associated with vascular procedures. We designed this study to evaluate the long-term impact of different levels of surgical stress among frail older patients undergoing vascular surgery procedures. Methods: We identified all independently living patients who underwent prospective frailty assessment followed by an elective vascular surgery procedure captured in the Vascular Quality Initiative registry (endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA] repair, thoracic endovascular aortic repair, suprainguinal and infrainguinal bypass, peripheral vascular intervention, carotid endarterectomy, and open AAA) at an academic institution between January 2016 and July 2018. Patient- and procedure-level data were obtained from our institutional data warehouse and Vascular Quality Initiative database, and used to calculate Vascular-Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity scores. The association between frailty and composite outcome of any major complications (surgical site infection; graft thrombectomy; major amputation; adverse cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic event; acute renal insufficiency; and/or reoperation related to the index procedure), nonhome living status, or death within 1 year after low-, medium-, and high-stress vascular procedures was evaluated using bivariate and logistic regression models. Results: A total of 163 patients were identified (70% male, mean age 67.8 years) who underwent open AAA repair (6%), endovascular AAA repair (21%), thoracic endovascular aortic repair (7%), suprainguinal bypass (5%), infrainguinal bypass (18%), carotid endarterectomy (18%), or peripheral vascular interventions (25%), which included 44 (27%) patients diagnosed with frailty before surgery. Overall, frail patients had significantly higher rates of the 1-year composite outcome (48% frail versus 27% nonfrail; P = 0.012) when compared with nonfrail patients, with a significant dose-dependent effect as the level of stress increased. In comparison, increasing levels of surgical stress had a negligible effect on long-term outcomes among nonfrail patients. The interaction between frailty and high surgical stress was found in adjusted regression models to be a significant predictor of adverse outcomes within 1 year after vascular surgery (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–8.6; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Frail patients who undergo high-stress vascular procedures have a significantly higher rate of complications leading to loss of functional independence and mortality within the year after their surgery. These data suggest that estimates of surgical stress should be incorporated into clinical decision making for frail older patients before and after surgery. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: During our 2007 to 2015 sample period, firms recorded unrealized gains and losses on fair-valued liabilities attributable to changes in the firms’ own credit risk, referred to as the debt valuation adjustment (DVA), in earnings. Various parties criticized the inclusion of DVA in earnings as counterintuitive and manipulable. Using a small but comprehensive sample of European banks reporting nonzero DVA during this period, we decompose banks’ DVA into a normal portion explained by economic factors (e.g., changes in bond yield spreads) and an abnormal portion (the residual). Controlling for abnormal loan loss provisions (LLP) and realized securities gains and losses (RGL), we find that banks’ abnormal DVA is negatively associated with their premanaged earnings, consistent with banks exercising discretion over DVA to smooth earnings. We further find that banks that record larger LLP or RGL or that have histories of using LLP or RGL to smooth earnings are less likely to exercise discretion over DVA. These findings obtain in the financial crisis but not afterward. Collectively, our findings suggest that banks exercised discretion over DVA substitutably with discretion over LLP and RGL during the crisis. With the caveat that our analysis is limited by a small sample and the inherent difficulties of DVA decomposition, our findings have implications for how bank regulators and investors should interpret banks’ reported DVA, particularly in stress periods such as the crisis, and they provide support for the International Accounting Standards Board and Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) decisions to require firms to record DVA in other comprehensive income starting in 2018. © The Author(s) 2020.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The paper links the recurrence of aquatic symbols in \"Hema and Kaushik\" with the same motif employed by Lahiri's in her latest (autobiographical) work, In Other Words. The discussion considers the fascination for water manifested by Kaushik's mother, Parul, that is transferred to Kaushik after her premature death. Deeply affected by the loss of his mother, Kaushik attempts to escape this painful experience by removing himself from the setting of its unfolding. The character's perpetual relocation starts as a trip along the American East Coast, whose austere, harsh landscape seems to strangely comfort him. His decision to explore this maritime locale appears paradoxical, given that Kaushik is afraid of water. His eventual drowning marks the end of Kaushik's struggle against the patterns of attachment that he considers inherently painful. At the same time, Lahiri's deployment of water symbolism in her own struggle for cultural redefinition serves as a tool that might clarify Kaushik's ambivalent relation with the maritime world. The present argument correlates the protagonists' transnational mobility and their attempts at transcultural negotiation with the fluid symbolism of aquatic borders. This analogy is meant to foreground their suspension between strategies of displacement and patterns of attachment. © 2017 Ovidius University. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Prototheca bovis is an algal emerging pathogen in dairy farms causing refractory protothecal mastitis with increasing incidence worldwide and significant economic impact. P. bovis infects cows throughout the lactation cycle, including dry periods, and can persist in the udder and the environment for a long time. Since P. bovis does not respond to treatments with antibiotics, the suggested sanitary measure to restrict the spread is culling infected animals. A point-of-care test for early detection of the causative agent is critically needed to guide farm management and the appropriate treatment of mastitis. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a highly specific molecular method, time-saving, cost-effective and easy to perform in limited settings. This study aimed to develop a LAMP assay for P. bovis detection directly from milk samples; it was employed in conjunction with a commercial DNA extraction kit which was previously used to extract DNA from milk specimens containing microbes. The LAMP assay detected P. bovis DNA within 1 h in milk samples spiked with P. bovis at a concentration of 50 cells/μL, enabling on-farm disease monitoring and decision-making based on a reliable diagnosis. The LAMP method will contribute to the accurate and rapid identification of P. bovis in asymptomatic or recurrent mastitis cases and consequently aid the implementation of targeted control measures and the reduction of losses in milk production. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Traditional dynamic energy management methods optimize the energy usage in wireless sensor nodes adjusting their behavior to the operating conditions. However, this comes at the cost of losing the predictability in the operation of the sensor nodes. This loss of predictability is particularly problematic for the battery life, as it determines when the nodes need to be serviced. In this paper, we propose an energy and relevance-aware monitoring method, which leverages the principles of self-awareness to address this challenge. On one hand, the relevance-aware behavior optimizes how the monitoring efforts are allocated to maximize the monitoring accuracy; while on the other hand, the power-aware behavior adjusts the overall energy consumption of the node to achieve the target battery life. The proposed method is able to balance both behaviors so as to achieve the target battery life, at the same time is able to exploit variations in the collected data to maximize the monitoring accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed method coordinates two different adaptive schemes, a dynamic sampling period scheme, and a dual prediction scheme, to adjust the behavior of the sensor node. The evaluation results show that the proposed method consistently meets its battery lifetime goal, even when the operating conditions are artificially changed, and is able to improve the mean square error of the collected signal by up to 20% with respect to the same method with the relevance-aware behavior disabled, and of up to 16% with respect the same algorithm with just the adaptive sampling period or the dual prediction scheme enabled. Consequently showing the ability of the proposed method of making appropriate decisions to balance the competing interest of its two behaviors and coordinate the two adaptive schemes to improve their performance. © 2023 The Author(s)\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In a smart grid, the main goals are to provide grid stability, improve power system performance and security, and reduce operations, system maintenance, and planning costs. The prediction stability of smart grid (SG) systems is essential in terms of power loss minimization and the importance of adequate energy policies. SG systems must accurately predict the energy demand and ensure the right amount of energy is available at the right time. If the prediction is inaccurate, it can lead to costly energy production or usage errors and create considerable inefficiencies in the power grid. Due to this, this manuscript offers five different cascade methods to detect the stability of SG systems. Detecting the stability of SG systems enables the grid to respond quickly to changes in demand and supply, improves system reliability, reduces power outages, and increases the overall efficiency of the grid. The present work proposed five different cascade methods with pre-processing, training and testing division, and the classification stages of the classification procedure for estimating SG stability. In the first pre-processing stage, the SG dataset is pre-proceeded with the feature selection (Relief, Fast Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF), and supervised attribute filter). The resampling (the bootstrapping), the Fuzzy C-Means Clustering-Based Feature Weighting (FCMFW), the resampling then feature selection (supervised attribute filter), and the feature selection (supervised attribute filter), then FCMFW. In the second stage, the training and testing division stage, the SG dataset was separated into three test and training data methods before the classification algorithm: The 5 Fold Cross Validation (FVC), 10 FVC, and hold-out (50–50%). In the third stage, the classification stage, five different classification algorithms, including Naive Kernel Bayes, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbors, Begged Trees, and Narrow Neural Network classifying algorithms, are used to classify the SG dataset. The simulation results of this study demonstrated that the suggested cascade ML system had achieved significant accuracy in predicting SG stability. The best cascade method is the feature selection (supervised attribute filter) + FCMFW + 10 FCV and then performing the bagged trees algorithm; thus, the new approach affords an accuracy of 99.9%. Furthermore, due to the rapid growth of ML techniques, sensors, and smart meters technologies, with Machine to Machine communication via the internet of things (IoT), the real-time identification process is made practical with higher accuracy. For this reason, our future research will focus on an IoT-based SG system, an E-stability determination system. Thanks to the proposed cascade method, the SG dataset can be classified easily, quickly, and reliably. E-stability determination systems can help to fast detect, predict, and respond, which is an important application of IoT on the grid systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Screening patients for frailty is traditionally done at the bedside. However, recent electronic medical record (EMR)-based, comorbidity-focused frailty assessments have been developed. Our objective was to determine how a common bedside frailty assessment, the trauma and emergency surgery (TEGS) frailty index (FI), compares to an EMR-based frailty assessment in predicting geriatric TEGS outcomes. Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed our quality improvement project database consisting of TEGS patients ≥ 65 y old. Patients were screened with the TEGS FI, a 15-question bedside assessment, including comorbidities, physical activity, emotional health, and nutrition. Six of 15 items were retrievable from the enterprise data warehouse (EDW), storing all EMR data from Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and use to calculate the EDW frailty score. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between different groups. Results: Two hundred thirty-six geriatric TEGS patients were included, of which 75 (31.8%) were TEGS FI frail and 60 (25.4%) were EDW frail. TEGS FI frail patients had increased length of stay (LOS), loss of independence (LOI), and complications compared to TEGS FI nonfrail patients. EDW frail patients had higher LOS and complications than EDW nonfrail patients but similar LOI. TEGS FI and EDW frail patients had similar outcomes except TEGS FI–only patients more often have LOI. Conclusions: Bedside frailty assessments and EMR-based assessments are both effective in identifying geriatric TEGS patients at risk for increased LOS and complications. However, bedside frailty screening was better at identifying patients who have LOI and may be a more appropriate choice when screening for frailty. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Hyperemesis gravidarum is a severe form of nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Our objective was to assess the feasibility of nasojejunal feeding in our patients. Eleven pregnant women aged 23-46 years with hyperemesis gravidarum, persisting in spite of an in-hospitat treatment of 2-15 days by intravenous fluids and antiemetic drugs and accompanied by weight loss, consented to have a nasojejunal feeding tube inserted endoscopically. Mean in-hospital weight loss prior to tube insertion was 2.2±1.1 kg (range 0.9-5.1 kg). A clear reduction in the extent of vomiting was already apparent within the first 48 h after tube insertion, but vomiting ceased completely after a mean of 5±4 days (range 1-13 days). Weight gain was recorded in six patients who stayed on tube feeding for more than 4 days. Patients were encouraged to start drinking and eating along tube feeding after 3-4 days. Ceasing vomiting and a concomitant sufficient oral intake of at least 1000 kcal/day resulted in the decision to remove the tube after 4-21 days. In three cases, however, the tube was expelled by recurrent vomiting after 1-4 days, or was blocked as in one case. The tube was not reintroduced and patients did not resume vomiting. There were no complications associated with this feeding approach in this population. Only one patient was readmitted. None of the rest resumed vomiting after tube withdrawal. The above suggests that nasojejunal enteral feeding can be an effective option in hyperemesis gravidarum persisting despite intravenous fluids and antiemetic drugs. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

      " Abstract: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is an ongoing challenge in the Torres Strait Islands (TSI) / Papua New Guinea (PNG) border region. Treatment success rates have historically been poor for patients diagnosed with DR-TB, leading to increased transmission. This study aimed to identify variables associated with unfavourable outcome in patients diagnosed with DR-TB to inform programmatic improvements. A retrospective study of all DR-TB cases who presented to Australian health facilities in the Torres Strait between 1 March 2000 and 31 March 2020 was performed. This time period covers four distinct TB programmatic approaches which reflect Australian and Queensland Government decisions on TB management in this remote region. Univariate and multivariate predictors of unfavourable outcome were analysed. Unfavourable outcome was defined as lost to follow up, treatment failure and death. Successful outcome was defined as cure and treatment completion. In total, 133 patients with resistance to at least one TB drug were identified. The vast majority (123/133; 92%) of DR-TB patients had pulmonary involvement; and of these, 41% (50/123) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB. Unfavourable outcomes were observed in 29% (39/133) of patients. Patients living with human immunodeficiency virus, renal disease or diabetes (4/133; 4/133; 3/133) had an increased frequency of unfavourable outcome (p <0.05), but the numbers were small. Among all 133 DR-TB patients, 41% had a low lymphocyte count, which was significantly associated with unfavourable outcome (p <0.05). We noted a 50% increase in successful outcomes achieved in the 2016–2020 programmatic period, compared to earlier periods (OR 5.3, 95% Confidence Interval [1.3, 20.4]).

      " Abstract: Background and objectives: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) during pregnancy is a rare event, and about half the cases are due to arteriovenous malformations (AVM). The authors describe the anesthetic approach of a 39 week pregnant patient scheduled for cesarean section, with a history of SAH due to AVM at 22 week gestation. Case report: 39 week pregnant patient, healthy prior to pregnancy, with a history of SAH at 22 week gestation, manifested by headache, vomiting, and dizziness without loss of consciousness or other defi cits on admission to the emergency room. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a left frontal AVM. After a short hospital stay for stabilization and diagnosis, the fi nal medical decision was to maintain the pregnancy and a multidisciplinary follow-up by neurosurgery and high-risk obstetric consultation. An elective cesarean section was performed at 39 weeks under epidural anesthesia. During the intraoperative period, an episode of hypotension rapidly reversed with phenylephrine occurred. The newborn Apgar score was 10/10. An epidural catheter was used for postoperative analgesia, also uneventful. Conclusions: There are very few published cases of anesthetic approach for pregnant women with symptomatic AVM. All decisions made by the multidisciplinary team, from choosing to continue the pregnancy to the ideal time for AVM intervention and type of anesthesia and analgesia, were weighted according to the risk of brain damage. Regarding the anesthetic procedure, the authors emphasize the need for hemodynamic stability. © 2013 Elsevier Editora Ltda.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: The aim was to analyze the long-term hearing results after simultaneous microsurgical extirpation via enlarged cochleostomy and cochlear implantation in intracochlear schwannoma as compared with non-tumor single-side deafness patients. Methods: Microsurgical extirpation via enlarged cochleostomy with simultaneous cochlear implantation was performed in 15 cases of intracochlear schwannoma between 2014 and 2021. Speech recognition tests in German language and impedance performances were collected over 36 months of observation and compared with an internal cohort of 52 age matched non-tumor single-side deafness patients. Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary referral center. Results: The surgery proved feasible and uneventful in all cases. In the case of intracochlear schwannoma, the hearing rehabilitation results were highly satisfactory and comparable to those of the non-tumor single-side deafness cohort. The speech recognition performance improved steadily in the first 12 months; afterward, it remained stable, providing indirect evidence against tumor recurrence during the follow-up. One patient required implant revision surgery related to device failure, but no recurrence was registered in the 36 months of observation. Conclusions: Cochlear implantation is the strategy of choice for hearing rehabilitation in case of intracochlear schwannomas in the long term. In particular, the combination of tumor extirpation via cochleostomy with a cochlear implantation in the same surgical time offers a viable therapy for intracochlear schwannoma, granting a sufficient degree of radicality without compromising the cochlear integrity. This technique allows for revision surgery if required. Level of Evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 134:1854–1860, 2024. © 2023 The Authors.

      " Abstract: The ability to localize sounds in azimuth was tested in five cats that had been binocularly deprived of vision from birth for several months and in three normal age‐matched controls. Brief tone bursts were presented in an eight‐choice apparatus along 360° of the azimuthal plane at constant elevation. Using positive reinforcement techniques, the cats were trained to walk from the centre of the 3 m diameter circular enclosure to the hidden loudspeakers. The distribution of sound localization error from 55 trials per cat at each speaker position was measured, and its standard deviation was used to assess the precision of sound localization. All cats localized tones straight ahead of them most precisely; performance at lateral and rear positions was gradually less precise. When the sound localization ability of normal and binocularly deprived cats was compared across speakers, a significantly enhanced precision was found for binocularly deprived cats overall (P < 0.002; two‐way analysis of variance). An improvement was found at each individual speaker position, but it was greatest at lateral and rear positions. In two sets of control experiments normal cats were retested (i) in the dark with the aid of an infrared camera and (ii) after 3 months of binocular lid suture. Normal cats in the dark did not show any differences in their sound localization behaviour. Late‐deprived cats showed a tendency for better performance, which fell short of statistical significance. Our results in visually deprived cats agree well with some reports on the sound localization ability of blind humans, but disagree with others. Our data provide support for a hypothesis of compensatory plasticity, in which sensory functions get sharpened with the loss of another modality. They seem to rule out the necessity for vision to play a role in the postnatal calibration of auditory space. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Decision-making on the use and management of chemicals in society is on the brink of a scientific and technological revolution. At the same time world politics is focusing more on chemicals, waste and pollution prevention, alongside climate change and biodiversity loss. To enable effective decision-making, policy makers and regulators will need to draw upon the best scientific evidence available on the real-life causation and consequences of adverse effects of chemical and waste exposures affecting humans, wildlife and the environment. New Approach Method (NAM) data from modern day multidisciplinary science and technology is becoming more available using cheminformatics, computational prediction algorithms using AI, transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, mathematical modelling, epidemiology, biological monitoring, and clinical science. Current chemical regulation has been shaped by the animal models of the 20th century. NAMs and Next Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) have the potential to better support innovations in chemicals and materials through science-informed decision making that is more species-relevant and protective of adverse outcomes; this will require future-proofed regulatory transformation.

      " Abstract: This study explores how a worsening bank credit quality affects firms' entry and exit decisions (i.e., changes in the extensive margin), and how the extensive margin variation amplifies the transmission of financial and technological shocks to the real economy. Using a vector autoregression (VAR) model, our empirical evidence indicates that deteriorating Chinese bank credit conditions have a significant negative influence on net firm entry to the market. To explore the potential mechanism behind the stylized fact, we establish a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model featuring fixed production costs, loss-related bank credit quality shocks and an endogenous balance sheet constraint which restricts the aggregate credit supply by the level of the banks' net worth. Model simulations indicate that the interaction of financial constraints and the extensive margin variation amplifies the impact of bank credit shocks on the real economy. When banks experience loss-related financial shocks, bank credit tightens, which increases firms' external financing costs. When the firms' expected income is not sufficient to cover the fixed production cost, some firms exit from or stop entering the market. As a result, the economy displays a severe recession and a slow recovery. Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV.\u001b[0m :\n",

These methods have been used since 2006 to issue a periodic report entitled Health of Wisconsin Report Card. The report highlights Wisconsin’s standing among other states and serves as an example for others seeking to measure and improve their population’s health. For 2021, we revisited our approach with an increased emphasis on disparities and health equity, which required many choices about data, analysis, and reporting methods. In this article, we outline the decisions, rationale, and implications of several choices we made in assessing Wisconsin’s health by answering several questions, among them: Who is the intended audience and which measures of length (eg, mortality rate, years of potential life lost) and quality of life (eg, self-reported health, quality-adjusted life years) are most relevant to them? Which subgroups should we report disparities about, and which metric is most easily understood? Should disparities be summarized with overall health or reported separately? Although these decisions are applicable to 1 state, the rationale for our choices could be applied to other states, communities, and nations.

      " Abstract: Microwave assisted pyrolysis (MWAP) is an alternative heating approach to convert biosolids into value-added products, such as biochar, biogas and bio-oil. Studying the dielectric properties of biosolids is fundamental to understand the behaviour of this material under microwave irradiation and to design microwave assisted pyrolysis systems. This study examined the dielectric properties of biosolids with changes in moisture content and applied microwave frequency. Results demonstrated that the dielectric constant decreases with decreasing moisture content and with increasing microwave frequency, but the dielectric loss factor of dry biosolids is almost zero. Simulations demonstrated that moisture content of biosolids impacts on the distribution and intensity of electromagnetic field. Because of the poor dielectric properties of dry biosolids, a microwave susceptor must be added to the biosolids to attract microwave energy so that the materials can reach temperatures required for pyrolysis. Therefore, this study also investigated the impact of four microwave susceptors (activated carbon, charcoal, biochar and glycerol) on biosolids pyrolysis and on biochar properties produced from biosolids via microwave assisted pyrolysis at 600 °C. The choice of microwave susceptor influences the heating rate of biosolids and the specific surface area of the resultant biochar. Results show that activated carbon favours the heating process, increases surface area, and the biochar produced with activated carbon has the highest carbon stability and energy value. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Optimal power flow (OPF) problem solution is a crucial task for the operators and decision makers to assign the best setting of the system components to obtain the most economic, environmental, and technical suitable state. Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm is a recent optimization algorithm that has been applied to solving several optimization problems. In this paper, a Modified Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm (MAHA) is proposed for improving the performance of the orignal Artificial Hummingbird Algorithm as well as effectivelly solve the OPF problem. The proposed MAHA is based on improving the searching capability by boosting the exploitation using the bandwidth motion around the best solution, while the exploration process is improved using the Levy flight distribution motion and the fitness-distance balance selection. This modified version helps overcome issues such as stagnation, premature convergence, and a propensity for local optima when tackling complex, nonlinear, and non-convex optimization problems like OPF. In order to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, a series of tests are conducted on 23 standard benchmark functions, including CEC2020. The resulting outcomes are then compared to those obtained using other algorithms such as fitness-distance balance selection-based stochastic fractal search (FDBSFS), antlion optimizer (ALO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), sine-cosine algorithm (SCA), fitness-distance balance and learning based artificial bee colony (FDB-TLABC), and traditional artificial hummingbird algorithm (AHA).The proposed algorithm is evaluated by solving the OPF problem with multiple objective functions on the IEEE 30-bus system. These objectives include fuel cost, fuel cost with valve loading effects, power losses, emissions, and voltage profile. Additionally, the algorithm's effectiveness is further assessed by testing it on single objective functions using medium and large-scale IEEE 57 and 118-bus networks.The results obtained by the proposed MAHA demonstrate its power and superiority for solving the OPF problem as well as the standard benchmark functions, surpassing the performance of other reported techniques. © 2023 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: An important question in state-dependent behaviour is how multiple influences on state are integrated to determine current behaviour. Aggressive behaviour is known to be affected by a prior contest experience. Nevertheless, whether and how multiple prior fighting experiences are integrated into a fighting decision remain unexplored. In this study, individuals of Rivulus marmoratus (Cyprinodontidae), a hermaphroditic fish, were given different combinations of two prior fighting experiences to investigate: (1) the effect of penultimate experiences on the probability of winning a subsequent contest; (2) the relative effect of a recent win and loss; and (3) whether the effect of a winning experience was as short lived as observed in other species. Penultimate and recent fighting experiences were given to the test fish approximately 48 and 24 h prior to the dyadic contests, respectively. From the results of the five types of contests staged, we conclude that: (t) penultimate fighting experiences had a significant effect on the probability of winning a subsequent contest; (2) a more recent experience had a more pronounced effect than an earlier experience, which suggested that the effect of a fighting experience would decay and/or the effect of a recent experience would interfere with the effect of an earlier experience; (3) no asymmetric effect between a winning experience and a losing experience was detected; and (4) the effect of both a winning and a losing experience lasted for at least 48 h in R. marmoratus which was the maximum time tested in these experiments.

      " Abstract: WeedSOFT is a state-of-the-art decision support system for weed management in the north central region of the United States, but its accuracy to predict corn yield loss associated with later-emerging weed communities has not been adequately assessed. We conducted experiments in 2004 and 2005 to compare observed and predicted corn yield related to four establishment times of mixed-species weed communities for validation of competitive index modifier (CIM) values in WeedSOFT. Weed communities were established at VE, V2, V4, and V6 corn (emergence, second-leaf, fourth-leaf, and sixth-leaf stages, respectively), and consisted largely of annual grass and moderately competitive annual broadleaf species. Compared to weed-free corn, yield loss occurred in each of seven site-years for weed communities established at VE corn, but in only one site-year for communities established at V2 corn. No corn yield loss was associated with weed communities established at V4 or V6 corn. For communities established at VE corn, predicted corn yield differed from observed yield in all but one site year, with predicted yield less than observed yield in three site-years, and greater than observed yield in two site-years; however, nonlinear regression analyses of yield data pooled over site-years showed that fitted values were similar between predicted and observed yield. For communities established at V2 and V4 corn, predicted yield was less than observed yield in six and five site-years, respectively. For communities established at V6 corn, predicted yield was less than observed yield in three of six site-years, but was similar to observed yield in three of six site-years. These results indicated that the CIM values in WeedSOFT tended to overestimate the competitiveness of late-emerging weed communities. Corn yield data from a pooled analysis of all site-years were used to generate a revised set of growth stage CIM values, which improved the accuracy of predicted corn yield. These results should improve weed management decisions and reduce the need for herbicide applications to late-emerging weeds.

      " Abstract: Soil organic matter (SOM) is the largest carbon pool in terrestrial ecosystems and underpins the health and productivity of soil. Accurate characterization of its chemical composition will improve our understanding of biotic and abiotic processes regulating its stabilization. Our purpose in this study was to estimate the loss of SOM by microbial and exoenzymatic activity that might occur when soil is extracted for analysis of representative low molecular weight mass features using untargeted metabolomics. Two mined clays (kaolinite, montmorillonite) and three diverse soils (varying in texture, specific surface area and cation exchange capacity) were used to assess the extraction efficiency and loss of three enzymatic activity indicators (2,6-dichloroindophenol sodium salt hydrate [DCIP], 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate [MUBph] and 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine [LDOPA]) during extraction with two different solvents (water and methanol). Losses of the indicators were attributed to extraction method (ultrasonication, shaking, or shaking following chloroform fumigation), physical properties associated with the soil/clay type, and microbial activity. Soil/clay type strongly influenced indicator recovery and hence, SOM recovery. Choice of extraction method strongly influenced the composition and recovery of representative SOM mass features, while the choice of solvent determined whether the soil type or extraction method had a greater influence of compositional differences in the SOM mass features extracted. Extraction following chloroform fumigation had the greatest loss of the indicators, due to enzymatic activity and/or adsorption onto the soil matrix. Minimal variation in composition and loss of SOM mass features occurred during extraction by shaking for the soils tested; we therefore recommend it as the method of choice for untargeted SOM extraction studies. © 2022\u001b[0m :\n",

First, instead of specifying a payoff distribution in an unique way, we allow customer-defined constraints and preferences for the choice of a distributional form of the payoff distribution. This leads to a class of possible payoff distributions. We determine upper and lower bounds for the corresponding strategies in stochastic order and describe related upper and lower price bounds for the induced class of cost-efficient payoffs. While the results for the cost-efficient payoff given so far in the literature in the context of Lévy models are based on the Esscher pricing measure we use as alternative the method of empirical pricing measures. This method is well established in the literature and leads to more precise pricing of options and their cost-efficient counterparts. We show in some examples for real market data that this choice is numerically feasible and leads to more precise prices for the cost-efficient payoffs and for values of the efficiency loss. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

Each experiment consisted of individual animals being offered mixed species assortments of foods fed over a four-day period. Ad libitum intake trials were conducted with the same foods used in the preference experiments but with only one food per trial. Intake trials also included beetles (Seaphinotus and Pterostichus spp.) and Pink Salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha). Salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis) and Stink Current (Ribes bracteosum) fruit and seeds emerged as highly preferred and valuable foods in terms of both relative preference and ad libitum intake. Devilsclub (Oplopanax horridus) and Elderberry (Sambucus racemosa) fruits were least preferred in both preference and intake, although their seeds were relatively palatable and nutritious (in terms of weight loss). Blueberry (Vaccinium ovalifolium) fruit was intermediate in both preference and intake. Tree seed palatability and intake ranked in order of Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis) (highest), Western Hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and Red Alder (Alnus rubra) (lowest).

      " Abstract: This paper describes a nonparametric approach to make inferences for aggregate loss models in the insurance framework. We assume that an insurance company provides a historical sample of claims given by claim occurrence times and claim sizes. Furthermore, information may be incomplete as claims may be censored and/or truncated. In this context, the main goal of this work consists of fitting a probability model for the total amount that will be paid on all claims during a fixed future time period. In order to solve this prediction problem, we propose a new methodology based on nonparametric estimators for the density functions with censored and truncated data, the use of Monte Carlo simulation methods and bootstrap resampling. The developed methodology is useful to compare alternative pricing strategies in different insurance decision problems. The proposed procedure is illustrated with a real dataset provided by the insurance department of an international commercial company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper, we consider the profit-maximizing demand response of an energy load in the real-time electricity market. In a real-time electricity market, the market clearing price is determined by the random deviation of actual power supply and demand from the predicted values in the day-ahead market. An energy load, which requires a total amount of energy over a certain period of time, has the flexibility of shifting its energy usage in time, and therefore is in perfect position to exploit the volatile real-time market price through demand response. We show that the profit-maximizing demand response strategy can be obtained by solving a finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) problem, which requires extremely high computational complexity due to continuous state and action spaces. To tackle the high computational complexity, we propose a dual approximate approach that transforms the MDP problem into a linear programing problem by exploiting the threshold structure of the optimal solution. Then, a row-generation-based solution algorithm is proposed to solve the problem efficiently. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that the proposed method significantly reduces the computational complexity of the optimal MDP problem (linear versus exponential complexity), while incurring marginal performance loss. More interestingly, the proposed demand response strategy hits a triple win. It not only maximizes the profit of the energy load, but also alleviates the supply-demand imbalance in the power grid, and even reduces the bills of other market participants. On average, the proposed quadratic approximation and improved row generation algorithm increases the energy load's profit by 55.9% and saves the bills of other utilities by 80.2% comparing with the benchmark algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Distinct isoforms of the PI3K catalytic subunit have specialized functions in the brain, but their role in cognition is unknown. Here, we show that the catalytic subunit p110β plays an important role in prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent cognitive defects in mouse models of Fragile X syndrome (FXS), an inherited intellectual disability. FXS is caused by loss of function of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which binds and translationally represses mRNAs. PFC-selective knockdown of p110β, an FMRP target that is translationally upregulated in FXS, reverses deficits in higher cognition in Fmr1 knockout mice. Genetic full-body reduction of p110β in Fmr1 knockout mice normalizes excessive PI3K activity, restores stimulus-induced protein synthesis, and corrects increased dendritic spine density and behavior. Notably, adult-onset PFC-selective Fmr1 knockdown mice show impaired cognition, which is rescued by simultaneous p110β knockdown. Our results suggest that FMRP-mediated control of p110β is crucial for neuronal protein synthesis and cognition. © 2015 The Authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the present work, extraction of andrographolide from Andrographis paniculata L. was carried out by mapping an ultrasound bath to identify the active and passive zones within it. This helps in accurately placing the extraction vessel in the bath for obtaining a maximum yield. Various parameters of extraction like choice of solvent, time of ultrasound exposure, solute to solvent ratio, temperature, position and depth of extraction vessel, the frequency used, and input power were investigated. Aluminum foil weight loss test was also performed at different positions and its results were compared with the results obtained for extraction at same positions. Results revealed a similar trend in variation for both the investigations. Highest yield of andrographolide obtained was 27.97. mg/g, at position 11, at a depth of 2.54. cm, in only 10. min of ultrasound irradiation, using 1:40 solute to solvent ratio, at a frequency of 22. kHz, utilizing 134. W of power with 50% ethanol as the solvent. Calorimetric studies were also carried out within the reaction vessel at these positions, to determine the actual power being utilized for extraction. Power dissipated at these locations differed from each other and maximum power was found to be dissipated at position 11.

      " Abstract: Background: In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic our institution was interested in forecasting how long surgical patients receiving elective procedures would spend in the hospital. Initial examination of our models indicated that, due to the skewed nature of the length of stay, accurate prediction was challenging and we instead opted for a simpler classification model. In this work we perform a deeper examination of predicting in-hospital length of stay. Methods: We used electronic health record data on length of stay from 42,209 elective surgeries. We compare different loss-functions (mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean relative error), algorithms (LASSO, Random Forests, multilayer perceptron) and data transformations (log and truncation). We also assess the performance of two stage hybrid classification-regression approach. Results: Our results show that while it is possible to accurately predict short length of stays, predicting longer length of stay is extremely challenging. As such, we opt for a two-stage model that first classifies patients into long versus short length of stays and then a second stage that fits a regresssor among those predicted to have a short length of stay. Discussion: The results indicate both the challenges and considerations necessary to applying machine-learning methods to skewed outcomes.

To prevent intensively used trails from degradation, they can be surfaced with durable materials. However, the surfaced tread may not necessarily provide full protection to the whole trail because the tread is just a part of the surfaced trail.A very limited number of studies have evaluated the performance of surfaced trails by empirically examining their conditions.Therefore, this paper collected data from 189 sample points along four high-use hiking trails in Hong Kong and examined the effects of surfacing, trail gradient, and their interactions on four trail condition indicators.The results indicated that, overall, both surfacing and trail gradient significantly affected trail conditions. Specifically, surfacing significantly reduced soil loss and soil compaction. Furthermore, the effects of trail gradient on width, maximum incision, and cross sectional area were significant among unsurfaced trails, but not in surfaced trails.These findings can supplement the existing literature by providing an understanding of relations between surfacing, trail gradient, and trail condition. © 2022 Soil Conservation Society of America.

      " Abstract: In rough set models, almost all computations, such as attribute reduction, rule reduction, etc., are based on attribute-value blocks. Computing attribute-value blocks is most frequently used and time-consuming basic operation for these computations. However, special studies were relatively little reported on the construction of efficient methods of computing attribute-value blocks for incomplete decision systems. In this paper, we considered two representative interpretations of missing values: “do not care” conditions and “lost values”, and divided incomplete decision systems into two categories: ones containing only “do not care” conditions and the other ones containing both “do not care” conditions and “lost values”, which lead to two kinds of rough set models, tolerance relation-based rough set models (TRRSMs) and characteristic relation-based rough set models (CRRSMs), respectively. Then, two algorithms, division algorithm and index algorithm, for computing attribute-value blocks were proposed, with the division algorithm for TRRSMs and the index algorithm for both CRRSMs and TRRSMs. The two proposed algorithms are far more efficient than usual algorithms when dealing with “do not care” conditions; the division algorithm is a little more efficient than the index algorithm when missing value degrees are small, but it can not deal with “lost values”, whereas the index algorithm is evidently more efficient than the division algorithm when missing value degrees are relatively large, and it is relatively insensitive to missing value degrees. Experimental results also show that the proposed algorithms are effective and efficient. Thus, the two proposed methods constitute an effective solution to the problem of efficiently computing attribute-value blocks for incomplete decision systems. © 2016\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the treatment of choice for ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Resources are limited during out of working hours (OWH). Whether PPCI outside working hours is associated with worse outcomes and whether outcomes have improved over time are unknown. Methods and Results-We analyzed 11 466 patients undergoing PPCI between 2004 and 2011 at all 8 tertiary cardiac centers in London, United Kingdom. We defined working hours as 9 am to 5 pm (Monday to Friday). We analyzed in-hospital bleeding and all-cause mortality =3 years, comparing OWH versus in-working hours. A total of 7494 patients (65.3%) were treated during OWH. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that PPCI during OWH was not a predictor for bleeding (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97-2.24; P=0.071) or 3-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.94-1.32; P=0.20). This was confirmed in propensity-matched analyses. Time-stratified analyses demonstrated that PPCI during OWH was a predictor for bleeding (odds ratio, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.06-3.80; P=0.034) and 3-year mortality during 2005 to 2008 (hazard ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00-1.50; P=0.050), but this association was lost during 2009 to 2011. During 2005 to 2008, transradial access was predominantly used during in-working hours and PPCI during OWH was predictive of reduced transradial access use (odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98; P=0.033), but this association was lost during 2009 to 2011. Conclusions-In this study of unselected patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, PPCI during OWH versus in-working hours had comparable bleeding and mortality. Time-stratified analyses demonstrated a reduction in adjusted bleeding and mortality during OWH over time.

      " Abstract: TED is a severe eye disease leading in rare cases to decrease of sight, optic nerve compression and blindness. Recently, significant progresses in understanding the disease have been done. Nevertheless, the treatment of the disease, especially in its severe form remains challenging. Glucocorticoids (GC) have been the basis of the treatment for a long time. Orbital irradiation (OI) and optical decompression (OD) are also used in managing the severe forms of TED. Somatostatin, intravenous immunoglobulin have been also used, with conflicting results. Regarding the potential for the treatment of TED with cytokine antagonists, controlled clinical studies are not available. Since cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of the TED, they seemed to be logical choice for modern TED treatment. It has been shown that both Th1 (interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor gamma, interleukin gamma) and Th2 (interleukin -4, -5, -10) profile T cells are activated in the TED. We therefore measured interleukin-gamma, IF-gamma and interleukin -10 (IL-10)(Th1 and Th2 pattern) to assess its relationship to the course of the disease. This paper shows that both Th1 (IL-2) and Th2 (IF-gamma) pathways represented by those two cytokines are not involved (IL-10 before 2.29+/-5.23 and after treatment 3.77+/-8.44; IF gamma before 0.50+/-0.24 and after treatment 0.35+/-0.19). No relationship to the response to treatment was found. GC resulted in positive response in 8/22 patients, OI (12 patients) given after CS therapy, resulted in a response in all patients.

Pancreas transplantation (PTx) alone is an option for type I diabetic patients without end-stage diabetic nephropathy. Knowledge of factors contributing to or predicting the rate of renal deterioration (including the effect of CsA on the patient’s renal function before transplantation) is necessary to determine candidacy for either kidney-pancreas transplantation or PTx alone To address this issue, we selected 12 pre-uremic patients with creatinine clearances (CrCl) above 40 ml/min and less than 100 ml/min to participate in a 6-week oral CsA challenge test. Serum chemistries, including serum creatinine (SCr) and CsA level, were measured weekly. Urinary protein and CrCl were measured at 0, 2,4, and 6 weeks. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (by 125I-sodium iothalamate clearance) was measured at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. All patients initially received oral CsA at 10 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses. Doses were adjusted to maintain a 12-hr trough level of 500-1000 ng/ml using a whole blood polyclonal TDX assay. Data are presented as mean ± SEM and as box-plot graphs. One patient was a CsA challenge test failure because SCr exceeded 3.0 mg/dl despite a reduction in CsA dose and level. Therefore, this patient was not a candidate for PTx alone and was excluded from further analysis. Among the 11 nonfailures, the mean CsA level at 6 weeks was 640±76 ng/ml. SCr increased from 1.2±0.1 mg/dl to 1.6±0.1 mg/dl (33% increase) (P=0.0001). CrCl decreased from 82±9 ml/min to 63±8 ml/min (24% decrease) (P=0.03). GFR decreased from 95±15 ml/min to 70±10 ml/min (26% decrease) (P=0.009). CrCl and GFR did not differ from one another at 0 and 6 weeks (r=0.77 and 0.98; P=0.3 and 0.7, respectively). Urinary protein decreased from 1.0±0.3 g/day to 0.7±0.3 g/day at both 4 and 6 weeks CP=0.03 and 0.06, respectively). Three of the 11 patients have not yet received transplants. Eight patients subsequently received PTx alone and were followed prospectively. Two allografts were lost early to rejection. Six were followed from 5 to 19 months after PTx alone. Scrum creatinine and CrCL measurements during the CsA challenge test predicted post-PTx levels: SCr 1.6±0.1 vs. 1.7±0.3 mg/dl, P=0.48, and CrCl 68±10 vs. 53 ±3 ml/min, P=0.17, respectively. © 1994 Williams and Wilkins.\u001b[0m :\n",

The failure to perform CP can lead to large losses, delays or severe loss of project quality. Although the most reliable approach identified in the literature is currently artificial neural network (ANN), it has weaknesses that negatively affect CP. In this study, a new approach called support vector machines (SVM) has been used to forecast a contractor's deviation from a client's objectives. In order to test the model, CP for 250 virtual contractors was solved. The proposed model had a great generalization in linear, nonlinear, noisy and inductive environments.

      " Abstract: Background: With the advances in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) research and the development of new immunotherapy drugs, the emergence of targeted drugs has greatly changed the diagnosis and treatment of GISTs and benefited more GIST patients. However, drug resistance has become increasingly challenging with the widespread application of targeted therapy in GIST patients. Based on the currently available evidence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has approved sunitinib as a second-line therapy and regorafenib as a third-line therapy, and research and development of more molecularly-targeted drugs are underway. Case Description: A middle-aged male patient was diagnosed with advanced small intestine GIST. Following the resection (R2) of tumors in the small intestine and pelvis, the patient received first-, second-, and third-line adjuvant therapies. However, follow-up examinations indicated progressive disease (PD). Ripretinib was then administered as the fourth-line therapy, and partial response (PR) was achieved 6 months later. To the best of our knowledge, this is a rare case in which the fourth-line adjuvant therapy for GIST achieved significant efficacy after unsuccessful systematic first-, second-, and third-line therapies. Conclusions: Imatinib, as the first-choice targeted therapy for advanced GISTs, has achieved notable clinical efficacy. After localized tumor progression on imatinib, second-line sunitinib may be applied. Third-line regorafenib therapy can be used in patients with GISTs who have failed both imatinib and sunitinib. In our current case, the patient experienced PD after regorafenib administration, and a satisfactory efficacy was obtained following the use of ripretinib. For patients with GISTs, after the failure of imatinib, sunitinib, and regorafenib, ripretinib may achieve a good therapeutic effect as a new targeted drug. Ripretinib is currently approved for use as a fourth-line or higher therapy in advanced GISTs, However, the ultimate place of ripretinib in metastatic or advanced GIST remains under investigation. This case achieved the therapeutic effect of PR through the treatment of repatinib, and there were no other obvious side effects except hair loss.

      " Abstract: The interaction of pollutants with Cultural Heritage materials leads to artworks and materials degradation and loss, causing an unpriceless damage. This works aims to estimate the impacts of air pollution and meteorological conditions on limestone, copper and bronze and represents the European risk assessment for corrosion of Cultural Heritage materials. The measures and policies for atmospheric pollution reduction have cut off the SO2 concentration and consequently its impact on materials is drastically reduced. Indeed, in 1980 the number of UNESCO sites in danger was extremely high (94% for limestone, 54% for copper and 1% for bronze) while in 2010 these sites did not exceed the tolerable value of surface recession and corrosion. However, some problem related to air pollution persists. In particular, Random Forest Analysis (RFA), highlights PM10 as the main responsible for materials corrosion, in 2010. Two scenarios in 2030 have been tested, highlighting that the corrosion levels of limestone, copper and bronze exceed the tolerable limits only in the Balkan area and Turkey. Our results show the importance in the air quality modelling as a powerful tool for the UNESCO sites conservation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Summary & Conclusions -This paper illustrates the value of analytic techniques for the safety analysis of dependable architectures at the system level. Its important contributions are: 1) comparative analysis of 5 common hardware-architectures for lifecritical applications, 2) demonstration of the effect of various coverage parameters on system safety, and 3) illustration of important metrics in evaluating system safety. Discrete space, CTMC (continuous time Markov chains) are used to model the 5 architectures at the building block level: a simplex architecture, two gracefully degrading architectures with & without repair, and two hard-failing architectures (hard-fail refers to: design of not reconfiguring to ensure continued operation). Comparative analysis has shown that: Safety & reliability usually entail tradeoff design issues -increasing reliability might not increase safety. If the coverage of the comparison process is not high enough, a simplex architecture can have a higher level of steady-state safety than other architectures which feature redundancy. Likewise, hard-fail architectures can provide a better measure of steady-state safety than the simplex. The cost for using a hard-fail approach is the reliability loss compared to an architecture which reconfigures as illustrated in the reliability & MTTF (mean time to failure) plots. Coverage of a single module and coverage of a comparison process can appreciably affect the steady-state safety and the MTTHE (mean time to hazardous event) of a system. For all of the case architectures, improving the coverage of a single module improved their MTTHE by a factor of 10 over the control case with all other coverage factors being equal. When the coverage of the comparison process improved, the hard-fail architectures had their MTTHE improve by a factor of 10 over their control case. Coverage on the voting process made an unimportant difference to the outcome of the MTTHE. Repair can appreciably improve the MTTF & MTTHE of a system, provided that the repair rate is factors of 10 greater than the system failure rate, but at the cost of a lower level of steadystate safety. In the MTTF analysis, adding a 'repair rate' = 3650 x'failure rate' could increase system MTTF by a factor of 2. In MTTHE analysis, repair in the gracefully degrading architectures made their MTTHE values comparable to their hardfailing counterparts. However, the cost of adding repair to hardfailing architectures yields a lower level of resiliency in their steady-state safety. If safety is an overriding concern in the system design, a hardfail architecture is an approach well worth looking at. However, the design cycle is subject to a myriad of goals, and the point of illustrating the models under reliability metrics is to underline the fact that designing a system for safety & reliability can incur a tradeoff decision between the two. ©1997 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

Educational opportunities are prioritised over ethnic cultural learning in parents’ decisions. However, parents hope their children will make up for this loss at a later life stage, at college and work.

In this approach, the Multi-Objective Sine Cosine Algorithm (MOSCA) is combined with Fuzzy Loss sensitivity Factor (FLSF) and grey relational analysis. FLSF is applied for determining the candidate buses which considered more suitable to be connected with the DSTATCOMs. Consequently, the search space of MOSCA will be reduced and its efficiency will be improved. A decision making based on grey relation analysis is applied for selecting the best solution among the available solutions for three objective functions. In this study, the DSTATCOMs are optimally allocated with the aim of reducing the total power losses, minimizing the Voltage Deviation (VD), as well as maximizing the Voltage Stability Index (VSI). To demonstrate the effectiveness of developed approach, the developed approach is comprehensively compared with well-known optimization algorithms to show its effectiveness in solving the studied problem. Different test systems (IEEE-33 bus, IEEE-69 bus, and 94 Portuguese distribution systems) are used for validation.

      " Abstract: Introduction: To evaluate the rates of inferior vena cava (IVC) filter retrieval and the number of patient's lost to follow-up, before and after the establishment of an IVC filter database and interventional radiology (inserting physician) led follow-up. Methods: On the 1st of June 2012, an electronic interventional radiology database was established at our Institution. In addition, the interventional radiology team took responsibility for follow-up of IVC filters. Data were prospectively collected from the database for all patients who had an IVC filter inserted between the 1st June 2012 and the 31st May 2014. Data on patients who had an IVC filter inserted between the 1st of June 2009 to the 31st of May 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Patient demographics, insertion indications, filter types, retrieval status, documented retrieval decisions, time in situ, trackable events and complications were obtained in the pre-database (n = 136) and post-database (n = 118) cohorts. Results: Attempted IVC filter retrieval rates were improved from 52.9% to 72.9% (P = 0.001) following the establishment of the database. The number of patients with no documented decision (lost to follow-up) regarding their IVC filter reduced from 31 of 136 (23%) to 0 of 118 patients (P = < 0.001). There was a non-significant reduction in IVC filter dwell time in the post-database group (113 as compared to 137 days, P = 0.129). Conclusion: Following the establishment of an IVC filter database and interventional radiology led follow-up, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the attempted retrieval rates of IVC filters and the number of patient's lost to follow-up. © 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The deployment of non-binary pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and soft decision (SD)-forward error correction (FEC) in future intensity-modulation (IM)/direct-detection (DD) links is inevitable. However, high-speed IM/DD links suffer from inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to bandwidth-limited hardware. Traditional approaches to mitigate the effects of ISI are filters and trellis-based algorithms targeting symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. The former approach includes decision-feedback equalizer (DFE), and the latter includes MaxLog-MAP (MLM) and soft-output Viterbi algorithm (SOVA). Although DFE is easy to implement, it introduces error propagation (EP). Such burst errors distort the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) required by SD-FEC, causing performance degradation. On the other hand, MLM and SOVA provide near-optimum performance, but their complexity is very high for high-order PAM. In this article, we consider a one-tap partial response channel model, which is relevant for high-speed IM/DD links. We propose to combine DFE with either MLM or SOVA in a low-complexity architecture. The key idea is to allow MLM or SOVA to detect only 3 typical DFE symbol errors, and use the detected error information to generate LLRs in a modified demapper. The proposed structure enables a tradeoff between complexity and performance: i) the complexity of MLM or SOVA is reduced and ii) the decoding penalty due to EP is mitigated. Compared to SOVA detection, the proposed scheme can achieve a significant complexity reduction of up to 94% for PAM-8 transmission. Simulation and experimental results show that the resulting SNR loss is roughly 0.3~0.4 dB for PAM-4, and becomes marginal 0.18 dB for PAM-8.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

We analyzed how students, recent graduates of Biology, Law, and Engineering, and environmental managers in Brazil ranked ten conservation actions. Reduction in habitat loss and in overexploitation, and in situ protection were consensual top priorities. Freshmen students have similar priorities, which change as their courses advance. Biologists, engineers, and lawyers agree about only two priorities, but not in a consensual order. Biologists gave little importance to financial resources; managers much higher, and lower to action plans. Flagship species and ex situ protection were least priorities for all. Prioritization was influenced by educational level and experience and some priorities are counterintuitive.

      " Abstract: Rainfed agriculture constitutes around 80% of the world’s agricultural land, achieving the lowest on-farm crop yields and greatest on-farm water losses. Much of this land is in developing countries, including sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where hunger is chronic. The primary constraint of rainfed agriculture—frequently experienced in SSA—is water scarcity, heightened by the unpredictability of season onset, erratic rainfall, as well as the inability of farmers to provide adequate soil and crop management. Farmers react differently to constraints, making a variety of choices—including the timing of planting, type of land cultivation, fertilization, and scattered fields, among many others. Limited information is available on the combined effects of these strategies for improving crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE). An experiment was co-conducted with farmers over four consecutive rainy seasons (2014–2018) in Tanzania, to evaluate these strategies for single and joint effects in improving yield and WUE on rainfed pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.). The treatments used were flat cultivation both without and with microdosing, as well as tied ridging without and with microdose interaction, with different planting dates depending on farmers’ decisions. Results show that farmers react differently to the early, normal, or late onset of the rainy season, and cumulative rainfall during its onset, which affects their decisions regarding planting dates, yield, and WUE. Microdose fertilization increases both the yield and WUE of pearl millet significantly, with greater effects obtained using tied ridging compared to flat cultivation. For low-income smallholder farmers in a semi-arid agroclimate, using tied ridging with microdosing during early planting is an effective response to spatiotemporal rainfall variability and poor soils. © 2019 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

We help risk-averse managers of operating rooms (ORs) to mitigate overtime in tactical surgery scheduling, which determines the assignment of elective patients to available ORs in upcoming time periods. We model the uncertain surgical durations via partial, full, or empirical distributions. To mitigate overtime, our model maximizes the risk aversion level of the OR manager (and thus the risk-hedging ability of the solution) while ensuring that the certainty equivalent of surgery duration in each OR at each time period does not exceed the stipulated working hours. The corresponding decision criterion, termed the maximized risk aversion level, is demonstrated in theory and in numerical experiments to be able to mitigate both the overtime probability and the expected overtime duration. To solve the problem, we develop an exact hill-climbing algorithm and demonstrate its convergence and correctness. Numerical experiments based on real-life surgery data show that our method outperforms the existing methods in several indicators that of concern to OR managers. In particular, this method is computationally amiable and hence is applicable to larger-scale instances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Large-scale sequencing efforts have captured a rapidly growing catalogue of genetic variations. However, the accurate establishment of gene variant pathogenicity remains a central challenge in translating personal genomics information to clinical decisions. Interferon Regulatory Factor 6 (IRF6) gene variants are significant genetic contributors to orofacial clefts. Although approximately three hundred IRF6 gene variants have been documented, their effects on protein functions remain difficult to interpret. Here, we demonstrate the protein functions of human IRF6 missense gene variants could be rapidly assessed in detail by their abilities to rescue the irf6 -/-phenotype in zebrafish through variant mRNA microinjections at the one-cell stage. The results revealed many missense variants previously predicted by traditional statistical and computational tools to be loss-of-function and pathogenic retained partial or full protein function and rescued the zebrafish irf6 -/-periderm rupture phenotype. Through mRNA dosage titration and analysis of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database, IRF6 missense variants were grouped by their abilities to rescue at various dosages into three functional categories: wild type function, reduced function, and complete loss-of-function. This sensitive and specific biological assay was able to address the nuanced functional significances of IRF6 missense gene variants and overcome many limitations faced by current statistical and computational tools in assigning variant protein function and pathogenicity. Furthermore, it unlocked the possibility for characterizing yet undiscovered human IRF6 missense gene variants from orofacial cleft patients, and illustrated a generalizable functional genomics paradigm in personalized medicine. © 2017 Li et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

We conducted a researcher-assisted questionnaire survey to clarify the impact of caregiver burden on family satisfaction and to determine the types of burden that decrease family satisfaction.Method: Bereaved family caregivers of patients with advanced cancer who received our outreach palliative care service were retrospectively identified. Family satisfaction with the end-of-life care provided by the palliative care service and caregiver burden were quantified using the Japanese versions of the FAMCARE Scale and the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), respectively.Results: Our study subjects included 23 family caregivers. The mean scores on the FAMCARE Scale and the ZBI for the total population were 72.8 ± 11.2 and 22.8 ± 17.3, respectively, indicating moderate-to-high satisfaction and low-to-moderate burden. Caregiver burden had a strong negative correlation to family satisfaction with end-of-life care (Spearman's rho [ρ] = -0.560, p = 0.005), which remained after adjustment for potential confounders (standardized beta [β] = -0.563, p = 0.01). Several burden items - including loss of control, personal time, social engagement with others, feeling angry with the patient, feeling that the patient wants more help than he/she needs, and a wish to leave the care to someone else - were associated with decreased satisfaction. The major cause of dissatisfaction for family members included the information provided regarding prognosis, family conferences with medical professionals, and the method of involvement of family members in care decisions.Significance of results: Caregiver burden can be a barrier to family satisfaction with end-of-life care at home.

The free energy barriers to crystallization are computed using umbrella sampling Monte Carlo simulations and from unconstrained molecular dynamics simulations using a mean first passage time formulation. We focus on state points that have been described in earlier work [S. Sastry and C. A. Angell, Nat. Mater. 2, 739 (2003)] as straddling a liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) between two metastable liquid states. It was argued subsequently [Ricci et al., Mol. Phys. 117, 3254 (2019)] that the apparent transition is due to the loss of metastability of the liquid state with respect to the crystalline state. The presence of a barrier to crystallization for these state points is therefore of importance to ascertain, which we investigate, with due attention to ambiguities that may arise from the choice of order parameters. We find a well-defined free energy barrier to crystallization and demonstrate that both umbrella sampling and mean first passage time methods yield results that agree quantitatively. Our results thus provide strong evidence against the possibility that the liquids at state points close to the reported LLPT exhibit slow, spontaneous crystallization, but they do not address the existence of a LLPT (or lack thereof). We also compute the free energy barriers to crystallization at other state points over a broad range of temperatures and pressures and discuss the effect of changes in the microscopic structure of the metastable liquid on the free energy barrier heights.  © 2021 Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Financial fraud is a societal problem for adults of all ages, but financial losses are especially damaging to older adults who typically live on fixed incomes and have less time to recoup losses. Persuasion tactics used by fraud perpetrators often elicit high levels of emotional arousal; thus, studying emotional arousal may help to identify the conditions under which individuals are particularly susceptible to fraud. We examined whether inducing high-arousal positive (HAP) and high-arousal negative (HAN) emotions increased susceptibility to fraud. Older (ages 65 to 85) and younger (ages 30 to 40) adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 emotional arousal conditions in a laboratory task: HAP, HAN, or low arousal (LA). Fraud susceptibility was assessed through participants' responses to misleading advertisements. Both HAP and HAN emotions were successfully induced in older and younger participants. For participants who exhibited the intended induced emotional arousal, both the HAP and HAN conditions, relative to the LA condition, significantly increased participants' reported intention to purchase falsely advertised items. These effects did not differ significantly between older and younger adults and were mitigated in participants who did not exhibit the intended emotional arousal. However, irrespective of the emotional arousal condition to which older adults were assigned (HAP, HAN, or LA), they reported greater purchase intention than did younger adults. These results inform the literature on fraud susceptibility and aging.

Second, do they correlate with observations from climatic data? Third, how do farmers respond and what are the factors determining adaptation? The analysis is based on household survey data from a sample of 900 farmers in rural Tanzania and secondary data from local meteorological stations. We find that farmers’ perception of a rising average temperature over time is generally confirmed. This is not the case for rainfall: farmers perceive that annual rainfall amount decreased, while climate data rather shows no change in the amount, but indicates a change in the rainfall pattern. However, we do find only a weak link between farmers’ perception and their behavior. Although farmers perceive climatic changes to happen and to affect them, some choose to not adapt at all and many only react in an evasive way, i.e., by coping measures that will not protect their household from future damage. Only a small share of farmers chose investment-intensive long-term strategies such as irrigation systems. Results confirm that a limited adaptive capacity plays a role, but also reveal the intention to adapt as a relevant factor. This is represented by the farmers’ loss experience due to climatic shocks and personality traits. This approach gives a more complete picture of the farmers’ adaptation decision. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The configuration programming of Distributed Generators (DGs) in a micro-grid (MG) through the achievement of multi-objective is an inevitable and primary issue ahead of micro-grid's construction. The motivation of this paper is to select the most suitable catalog of MG from DC micro-grid (DC-MG), AC micro-grid (AC-MG), and hybrid MG by means of uncertainties' models and corresponding DGs' configurations. The DGs in all catalogs of MG are composed of wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV), biomass generation (BG), and battery energy storage (BES) system. In terms of uncertainties' models, the proposed mathematical models are combined with multifarious scenarios which are considered the uncertainties of variations in solar irradiance and wind speed, temperature, and load demand. Particularly, this paper also proposes differences in allocations and sizes of all the equipment based on the assumed specific structure for each catalog of MG. Then, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) is utilized by MATLAB working platform to compute the multi-objective functions associating with the minimized system cost, the loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for each catalog of MG. Finally, the results and comparisons demonstrate that the AC-MG is the optimal catalog for the case study, which has superiorities of economy and reliability. Although the DC-MG has lower GHG emissions, the AC-MG is the optimal choice after the comprehensive comparisons and analyses depended on three objectives.  © 2013 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Due to the increasing penetration of renewable energy, the problem of curtailing wind and photovoltaic is becoming more and more prominent. Peak regulation market is established for renewable integration in China. Owing to the flexibility in demand side, the aggregator is able to participant in the peak regulation market. For this purpose, this paper aims to derive an optimal scheduling and offering strategy for the aggregator in the peak regulation market. The proposed strategy applies information gap decision theory (IGDT) to deal with the uncertainty of the market clearing price. First, the aggregator's deterministic strategy is given which considers two types of load: temperature control load (TCL) and electric vehicle (EV). And based on IGDT, the robust strategy and the opportunistic strategy are presented. Then, in order to further reduce the profit loss caused by the forecasted error of the market clearing price, the step offering curve is developed. Finally, the results of case studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. © 2022 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Dynamic treatment regime (DTR) is an emerging paradigm in recent medical studies, which searches a series of decision rules to assign optimal treatments to each patient by taking into account individual features such as genetic, environmental, and social factors. Although there is a large and growing literature on statistical methods to estimate optimal treatment regimes, most methodologies focused on complete data. In this article, we propose an accountable contrast-learning algorithm for optimal dynamic treatment regime with survival endpoints. Our estimating procedure is originated from a doubly-robust weighted classification scheme, which is a model-based contrast-learning method that directly characterizes the interaction terms between predictors and treatments without main effects. To reflect the censorship, we adopt the pseudo-value approach that replaces survival quantities with pseudo-observations for the time-to-event outcome. Unlike many existing approaches, mostly based on complicated outcome regression modeling or inverse-probability weighting schemes, the pseudo-value approach greatly simplifies the estimating procedure for optimal treatment regime by allowing investigators to conveniently apply standard machine learning techniques to censored survival data without losing much efficiency. We further explore a SCAD-penalization to find informative clinical variables and modified algorithms to handle multiple treatment options by searching upper and lower bounds of the objective function. We demonstrate the utility of our proposal via extensive simulations and application to AIDS data. © 2023, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We provide a new method for solving a very general model of an assemble-toorder system: multiple products, multiple components that may be demanded in different quantities by different products, batch production, random lead times, and lost sales, modeled as a Markov decision process under the discounted cost criterion. A control policy specifies when a batch of components should be produced and whether an arriving demand for each product should be satisfied. As optimal solutions for our model are computationally intractable for even moderately sized systems, we approximate the optimal cost function by reformulating it on an aggregate state space and restricting each aggregate state to be represented by its extreme original states. Our aggregation drastically reduces the value iteration computational burden. We derive an upper bound on the distance between aggregate and optimal solutions. This guarantees that the value iteration algorithm for the original problem initialized with the aggregate solution converges to the optimal solution. We also establish the optimality of a lattice-dependent base-stock and rationing policy in the aggregate problem when certain product and component characteristics are incorporated into the aggregation/disaggregation schemes. This enables us to further alleviate the value iteration computational burden in the aggregate problem by eliminating suboptimal actions. Leveraging all of our results, we can solve the aggregate problem for systems of up to 22 components, with an average distance of 11.09% from the optimal cost in systems of up to 4 components (for which we could solve the original problem to optimality). © 2018, INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Incorporating measurements on correlated traits into genomic prediction models can increase prediction accuracy and selection gain. However, multi-trait genomic prediction models are complex and prone to overfitting which may result in a loss of prediction accuracy relative to single-trait genomic prediction. Cross-validation is considered the gold standard method for selecting and tuning models for genomic prediction in both plant and animal breeding. When used appropriately, cross-validation gives an accurate estimate of the prediction accuracy of a genomic prediction model, and can effectively choose among disparate models based on their expected performance in real data. However, we show that a naive cross-validation strategy applied to the multi-trait prediction problem can be severely biased and lead to sub-optimal choices between single and multi-trait models when secondary traits are used to aid in the prediction of focal traits and these secondary traits are measured on the individuals to be tested. We use simulations to demonstrate the extent of the problem and propose three partial solutions: 1) a parametric solution from selection index theory, 2) a semi-parametric method for correcting the cross-validation estimates of prediction accuracy, and 3) a fully non-parametric method which we call CV2*: validating model predictions against focal trait measurements from genetically related individuals. The current excitement over high-throughput phenotyping suggests that more comprehensive phenotype measurements will be useful for accelerating breeding programs. Using an appropriate cross-validation strategy should more reliably determine if and when combining information across multiple traits is useful. Copyright © 2019 Runcie, Cheng.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aim and background: Dermoscopic diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions is based on the evaluation of dermoscopic criteria (classical pattern analysis) and on alternative diagnostic methods, such as the ABCD (A, asymmetry; B, border; C, color; D, differential structures) rule based on the total dermatoscopic score. The aim of the study was to investigate the interobserver agreement of standard dermoscopic criteria between two observers and the diagnostic validity of dermoscopic diagnosis by pattern analysis and by the ABCD rule. Study design: The study included a total of 129 small (≤55 mm) melanocytic skin lesions selected from all lesions observed in consecutive patients between April 1996 and September 1998. Before surgery, each lesion was photographed with a Dermaphot. Dermoscopic images were examined independently by two observers to evaluate the presence or absence of standard dermoscopic criteria and to establish the dermoscopic diagnosis by pattern analysis and by the ABCD rule. Results: Interobserver agreement for dermoscopic criteria varied from moderately good to good, with the highest agreement for radial streaks (k = 0.96) and the lowest for pseudopods (k = 0.49). Interobserver agreement was moderately good in dermoscopic diagnosis by pattern analysis (k = 0.48) and by the total dermatoscopic score (k = 0.44). The sensitivity and specificity of dermoscopic diagnosis by pattern analysis were 40% and 99%, respectively, for both observers. As regards the total dermatoscopic score (a cutoff score of ≤5.45 vs >5.45), sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100% and specificity from 48% to 59%. Conclusions: The study showed that the pattern analyses as well as the ABCD rule give a poor discrimination between benign and malignant lesions and do not add relevant information for management decision in small melanocytic lesions. However, close follow-up examinations of small equivocal melanocytic lesions using digital equipment allow evaluation of their dermoscopic features during progression and whether their rather commonly found atypical dermoscopic features are lost during their natural course of growth.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: This study was undertaken to report the outcome of pregnancies achieved after ovarian stimulation, including the use of the aromatase inhibitor, letrozole, for ovarian stimulation. Study design: A cohort study comparing the outcome of pregnancies achieved after letrozole and other ovarian stimulation treatments with a control group of pregnancies spontaneously conceived without ovarian stimulation. Results: In 3 tertiary referral centers, there were 394 pregnancy cycles in 345 infertile couples (63 pregnancies with 2.5 mg of letrozole alone or with gonadotropins, 70 pregnancies with 5.0 mg of letrozole, 113 pregnancies with clomiphene alone or with gonadotropins, 110 pregnancies with gonadotropins alone, and 38 pregnancies achieved without ovarian stimulation). Pregnancies conceived after letrozole treatments were associated with similar miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates compared with all other groups. In addition, letrozole use was associated with a significantly lower rate of multiple gestation compared with clomiphene citrate. Conclusion: The favorable pregnancy outcome and low multiple gestation rate of aromatase inhibitors for ovarian stimulation is encouraging for the development of these agents as first-line ovulation induction agents. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.; FreeText:All pregnancies were diagnosed by positive pregnancy test. Pregnancy was achieved after ovarian stimulation in 356 cycles, whereas in 38 cycles pregnancies were achieved spontaneously without ovarian stimulation. Treatment cycles included timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination (IUI) while undergoing follicular monitoring with the use of serial measurements of serum estradiol and luteinizing hormone (LH) and transvaginal ultrasonography. CLO was administered orally at a dose of 50 to 100 mg daily from day 3 to day 7 of the menstrual cycle. When combined with gonadotropins, gonadotropin injections were started on the last day of CLO administration or when combined with Femara, gonadotropin injections were started on the last day of Femara administration. When given alone, gonadotropin injections started on day 3 of the menstrual cycle at a dose of 50 to 300 IU daily. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) (Profasi, Pregnyl) was given subcutaneously at a dose of 10,000 units to trigger ovulation in most of the cycles when an average of 1 to 2 mature follicles were obtained. The patients were not randomly assigned and the choice of receiving an aromatase inhibitor for ovarian stimulation was based on discussion between the patient and the prescribing physician.; Indications:Female infertility in 133 patients. Coexisting disease: polycystic ovary disease.; Patients:1650 infertile couples completed 3045 treatment cycles. The study included the outcome of 394 treatment cycles in 345 patients in which pregnancy was diagnosed.

Follow-up period: from clinical pregnancy until delivery or pregnancy loss.; TypeofStudy:A multicenter, cohort study comparing the early outcome of pregnancies achieved after ovarian stimulation (including Femara, clomiphene citrate [CLO], gonadotropins) with a control group of pregnancies spontaneously conceived without ovarian stimulation.; DosageDuration:2.5 and 5.0 mg daily, orally, from day 3 to day 7 of the menstrual cycle.; ComparativeDrug:Clomiphene citrate (Serophene) 50 100 mg daily, orally from day 3 to 7 of the menstrual cycle, plus gonadotropins (Gonal-F, Puregon) 50- 300 IU daily starting on the last day of clomiphene treatment in combination therapy. Gonadotropin monotherapy 50 - 300 IU daily commenced on day 3 of the menstrual cycle.; Results:Pregnancy rates per cycle and rates of pregnancy loss for CLO, gonadotropins alone, Femara 2.5, Femara 5.0 mg, CLO + gonadotropins, Femara + gonadotropins, and control group were 80 (8%) and 25 (31.3%), 110 (16.4%) and 27 (24.6%), 33 (19.8%) and 10 (30.3%), 70 (16.2%) and 13 (18.2%), 33 (16.1%) and 7 (21.2%), 30 (19.6%) and 8 (26.7%), and 38 (9%) and 11 (29%), respectively. Pregnancies achieved after Femara use were not associated with increased risk for chemical pregnancies or miscarriage. The rates of total pregnancy loss ranged from 18.2% to 31.3% (5.0 mg daily Femara treatment and CLO treatment, respectively). The rate of total pregnancy loss in spontaneous conceptions without ovarian stimulation was 29%. There was no statistically significant difference in rate of pregnancy loss between Femara alone (2.5 or 5 mg) or with gonadotropins and other treatment protocols. P values were .94, .52, .61, and .93 comparing Femara 2.5 mg with CC, CC plus gonadotropins, gonadotropins, or spontaneous cycles, respectively. P values were .17, .81, .45, and .33 for Femara 5 mg and .73, .72, .88, and .88 for Femara plus gonadotropins for the same comparisons. The rate of multiple gestation (all multiple gestation cases were twins) was significantly lower with 2.5 mg (P values were .03, .04, .05, and .05) or 5.0 mg daily (P values were .02, .03, .04, and .05) Femara treatment (alone) when compared with all other ovarian stimulation treatments (CLO, CLO + gonadotropins, gonadotropins alone, and Femara + gonadotropins respectively). CLO treatment (alone or with gonadotropins) was associated with the highest multiple gestation rate when compared with the other ovarian stimulation treatments (Femara alone or with gonadotropins) and gonadotropins alone. There was no significant difference between the rate of multiple gestation after gonadotropin only treatment and Femara + gonadotropins treatment. There were no multiple pregnancies achieved without ovarian stimulation. There were 9 cases of ectopic pregnancies (all tubal ectopic pregnancies), 1 case after CLO + gonadotropin treatment, 1 case in the spontaneous pregnancy group (no ovarian stimulation), 2 after CLO treatment, 2 after gonadotropins alone treatment, and 3 after Femara + gonadotropins treatment. There were no cases of ectopic pregnancy after Femara only treatment regardless of the dose used. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of ectopic pregnancies among the various ovarian stimulation treatments. The overall low rate of ectopic pregnancy (2.3%) in these patients may be explained by the absence of any demonstrable tubal damage as a criterion for selection for IUI. It is possible that 1 or more cases of ectopic pregnancy could have occurred in the Femara groups but spontaneously resolved before clinical detection and was counted as cases of chemical pregnancy (total of 21 cases).; AdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned.; AuthorsConclusions:In the current trial, we demonstrate promising clinical pregnancy rates after using an aromatase inhibitor for ovarian stimulation, similar pregnancy outcome compared with other stimulation regimens, and a reduced risk of a multiple gestation. These results suggest that aromatase inhibitors are successful for ovarian stimulation and could possibly be applied in the future as a firstline treatment for World Health Organization (WHO) type 2 anovulation. Moreover, the oral administration of an aromatase inhibitor without the need for close cycle monitoring would enhance the clinical application of these agents for ovarian stimulation in the absence of sophisticated and expensive monitoring for infertility management.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: Hearing in the extended high frequencies (EHFs; >8 kHz) is perceptually and clinically relevant. Recent work suggests the possible role of EHF audibility in natural listening environments (e.g., spatial hearing) and hidden hearing loss. In this article, we examine the development of frequency discrimination (FD) in the EHFs. Specifically, the objectives of the present study were to answer if the developmental timeline for FD is different for EHFs; and whether the discontinuity of FD thresholds across frequency - representing the hypothetical shift from a temporal to place code - for children occurs at about the same frequency as adults. Design: Thirty-one normal-hearing children (5 to 12 years) and 15 young adults participated in this study. FD thresholds were measured for standard frequencies (1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 kHz) and EHFs (10 and 12.5 kHz) using a three-alternative (odd-ball) forced-choice paradigm. Statistical analysis focused on examining the change of FD thresholds as a function of age and estimating the breakpoints in the discrimination threshold-frequency functions. Results: FD performance in younger children for EHFs was nearly six times poorer relative to older children and adults; however, there was no effect of test frequency on the child-adult difference. Change-point detection on group data revealed a higher knot frequency - representing the putative transition from temporal to place mechanisms - for adults (9.8 kHz) than children (∼6 kHz). Individual spline functions suggest that the knot frequency varied from 2 to 10 kHz across participants. Conclusions: The present study provides evidence for a similar rate of maturation of FD for EHFs and standard frequencies. FD at EHFs matures by 10 to 12 years of age. Adult listeners may not all use temporal cues up to 10 kHz. Young children are relatively inefficient in using temporal fine-structure cues for FD at frequencies above 6 kHz. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Agents may influence producers’ insurance decisions to maximize their total compensation. We develop a theoretical model of producer–agent interaction to examine how loss potential, agent compensation mechanisms, and market competition affect the coverage level selected. Using crop insurance unit-level datasets from five states, we find evidence that agent market concentration and agents’ market share matter in the insurance coverage decisions of producers but that the economic significance of the influence is relatively small. Agent influence over coverage level, premium, and liability choice is generally positive but inconsistent across states, which may be attributable to differences in loss risk and agent compensation mechanisms. © 2020 The Authors.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses panel data set from sample consisted of 286 non-financial listed companies in the main market of Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as Kuala Lumpur stock exchange) for three years 2010-2012. The empirical understanding of TD depends on publicly source of data in the financial statement, characterized in the aggregated note of tax expenses. TD was measured using modified effective tax rate reconciling items, as it is appropriate in the Malaysian environment. The paper uses multivariate statistical analyses on this sample. Findings: The empirical results of the multivariate regressions indicated that TD exhibits significant positive association with the TLOS component of TS but has significant negative relationship related to the PDs component of TS and TDFs component of TS. Research limitations/implications: This study extends the prior-related literature by examining the relation between TD and component of TS. This study depends on both the signaling theory and the Scholes–Wolfson framework. These are the main theories concerned with TD and TP (TSs), respectively. Therefore, from a theoretical side, the authors adds to the current theories by verifying that users are the party influenced whether positively or negatively, by the extent of TD or the extent of activities of TP through Malaysian organizations. Practical implications: The evidence found by this study has important policy and practical knowledge implications for a minimum of three parties, namely, authorities, researchers in academic field and decision-makers and firm managers. The findings can provide them some relevant insights on the importance of TS actions from companies’ perspective and contribute to the discussion of who verifies and deduces from TD directed by companies. Originality/value: This study is regarded as the first attempt to examine the impact of the component of TS, namely: PDs, TDFs, FTRs differentials and TLOS on TD in a developing nation such as Malaysia.

      " Abstract: The mountain cryosphere is one of the strongest affected systems by climate change. Glacier shrinkage leads to cascading impacts, including changes in river flow regimes, availability of water resources for downstream populations and economy, changes in the occurrence and severity of natural hazards, and cultural changes associated with landscape character and identity. In this study, we analyze impacts of mountain cryosphere change through a lens of Loss and Damage (L&D), a mechanism of international climate policy that tries to evaluate and reduce negative consequences of climate change for societies. We analyze the effects of climate change on glacier change, glacier lake formation and growth, hydrological regimes, and associated impacts on human societies in the Cordillera Blanca in the Peruvian Andes, now and under future scenarios. We use various methods such as literature review, glacial lake outburst flood, and hydrologic modeling to examine three major dimensions of cryospheric change and associated human impacts: (i) ice loss; (ii) glacial hazards; and (iii) variability of water availability. We identify the damage and losses in terms of the number of people affected by glacial hazards, monetized agricultural crop loss due to water loss, and non-economic values local people attribute to glacier loss. We find that different levels of warming have important negative but differentiated effects on natural and human systems. We also contend that the extent of loss and damage will largely be determined by governance and adaptation decisions such as water resource management and disaster risk management. We suggest that these lines of evidence are more explicitly taken into account in L&D policies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In the face of the Triple Planetary Crisis concerning climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, the global community is in dire need of quantitative, data-based approaches to inform its response and guide its path towards a sustainable and equitable future. Government spending and fiscal policy are key levers in shaping this response. In order to assess the potential for using machine learning to inform policymakers' and governments' decision-making and spending allocation decisions based on environmental outcomes, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) collaborated to produce a joint pilot study. The study uses official development assistance data (ODA) to train machine learning models to predict deforestation rates in six different countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Madagascar, Solomon Islands, and Zambia. Initial modelling results were promising and the approach could prove to be a valuable asset to policymakers by enabling scenario analysis, where hypothetical budgets or spending allocations can be run through models trained on historical data to give insight on potential impacts on environmental indicators. Future research could be expanded to a pilot study with a national government using disaggregated budget data instead of ODA as model inputs. © 2022 - The authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Globally, African savanna elephants have been assessed as 'endangered'. Consequently, additional threats and losses due to human-elephant conflict (HEC) could further exacerbate the species' decline. In stark contrast, South Africa's elephant populations are mostly confined within fenced-in reserves that impede natural processes such as migration. As ecosystem engineers, elephant population growth herein should be limited. Within South Africa, elephant management has evolved as differing wildlife philosophies from utilitarian conservation ('nature for man') to biocentric preservation ('nature for nature') and a combination thereof, have been practiced. Traditionally, both HEC and population control have been largely synonymous with lethal control, i.e. culling. However, with the increase of public or expert input to Policy, lethal control is not favoured by the public. As an alternative, immunocontraception of female African savanna elephants through non-invasive, native porcine zona pellucida (pZP) vaccinations has been employed successfully and is currently adopted in 43 elephant reserves across South Africa. Current legislation now recommends culling as the last population management resort. Newly promulgated legislation calls for wellbeing and welfare to be carefully measured in all biodiversity management decisions taken to minimise threats to biodiversity. As a keystone species, elephant is a direct driver of biodiversity change. Accordingly, and in light of these developments, all population management options, including immunocontraception, must be fully considered in South Africa's largest national park, the Kruger.  © 2023 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

      " Abstract: Background: An increasing body of research has examined the link between biodiversity of birds and human mental health, but most studies only use cross-sectional data. Few studies have used longitudinal or repeated cross-sectional data to investigate the mental health benefits of bird diversity. The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between bird diversity and mental health at the national level using a unique repeated cross-sectional dataset. Methods: I used repeated cross-sectional health data from the German National Cohort health study, collected between March, 2014, and September, 2019, and annual bird citizen science data to investigate the effects of bird-diversity exposure on mental health. Mental health was measured using the summary score of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression module 9 (SumPHQ) and the Short Form Health Survey-12 Mental Health Component Scale. As a proxy for bird diversity, I created a unique indicator called reporting-rate richness and combined it with the health data. Reporting-rate richness measures the number of bird species within postcode areas across Germany in probabilities while accounting for variation in survey efforts. Alternative indicators of bird diversity, such as bird-species richness or abundance, were also calculated. Associations between bird diversity and mental health were estimated using linear regression with region and time fixed effects, adjusted for a range of sociodemographic and environmental confounders and spatial autocorrelation. Interaction terms between income levels and reporting-rate richness were also analysed to examine the moderating effect of socioeconomic status. Findings: I did the analyses for an unbalanced (n=176 362) and balanced (n=125 423) dataset, with the balanced dataset comprising only regions (postcode areas) in which health data were available for each year. The linear fixed-effects regression analysis indicated a significant negative association between reporting-rate richness and SumPHQ, as observed in both the unbalanced dataset (β –0·02, p=0·017) and the balanced dataset (β –0·03, p=0·0037). Similarly, regression results with both datasets showed a positive relationship between reporting-rate richness and Mental Health Component Scale (MCS; unbalanced β 0·02, p=0·0086; balanced β 0·03, p=0·0018). The moderator analyses revealed a significant influence of socioeconomic status on the relationship between reporting-rate richness and mental health. The robustness of these findings was confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Interpretation: The results suggest that a greater likelihood of having many different bird species in a person's area of residence might positively contribute to mental health, especially for people with lower socioeconomic status. These findings could have implications for biodiversity conservation and health policy decisions, as governments are facing challenges such as global biodiversity loss and growing public mental health problems.

      " Abstract: This article presents an receiver (RX) only equalization (ROE) technique that eliminates feed-forward equalization (FFE) in transmitter (TX) and bandwidth improved output driver without increment of power consumption. With a help of the proposed design technique, the power consumption, circuit complexity, and design cost are improved. The proposed RX with one-tap finite-impulse response (FIR) and second-tap IIR decision feedback equalizer (DFE) removes the FFE equalization in TX by moving the sampling point of main cursor in the received data. A simpler TX architecture with nMOS only output driver (NOD) owing to the ROE facilitates a wide bandwidth and energy efficient dual-mode (differential and single-ended) operation. The proposed transceiver was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology. The RX achieves bit error rate (BER) less than 10{-12} over a 22-dB channel loss at 32 Gb/s with 0.62-pJ/bit energy efficiency, and the TX with NOD has 0.77- and 0.40-pJ/bit energy efficiency at 32 Gb/s in differential mode and single-ended mode, respectively.

      " Abstract: Several short-cut statistical methods can be used with considerable saving of time and labor. This paper presents some useful techniques applicable to a small number of observations. Advantages of the median as a substitute for the average are discussed. The median is especially useful when a quick decision must be made and gross errors are suspected. The range may be used to estimate the standard deviation and confidence intervals with little loss in precision for small numbers of observations. A convenient criterion for rejecting gross errors is presented. A table gives efficiencies and conversion factors for two to ten observations. The statistical methods presented are sufficiently simple to find use by those who feel that “statistics are too much trouble.” These methods are usually more exact than the statistics of large numbers applied directly to small numbers of observations. © 1951, American Chemical Society.

      " Abstract: Objective: To estimate whether women who receive an immediate postabortion etonogestrel subdermal implant have higher discontinuation rates than women who undergo an interval insertion (insertion not associated with a recent pregnancy). Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project. We compared 12-month continuation rates for the subdermal implant between women undergoing immediate postabortion placement and women who underwent an interval placement. Continuation rates were compared using Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival function and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Over the study period, 141 women received the implant immediately postabortion and 935 women underwent an interval placement. The 12-month continuation rates were similar: 81.5% among women undergoing immediate postabortion placement and 82.8% among women undergoing interval placement (P=.54). In the survival analysis, women who received an immediate postabortion implant were no more likely to discontinue their method than women who had an interval placement (adjusted hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 0.68-1.60). The most common reason given for discontinuation was frequent or irregular bleeding, which was reported by 65.4% of women discontinuing in the immediate postabortion group and 56.7% in the interval group. Conclusion: Women who undergo immediate postabortion placement of the subdermal implant have high rates of continuation that are equivalent to women undergoing interval insertion. Immediate postabortion long-acting reversible contraceptives should be available to women undergoing induced abortion to decrease the risk of repeat unplanned pregnancy. © 2012 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

      " Abstract: Background: In professional sports, injuries resulting in loss of playing time have serious implications for both the athlete and the organization. Efforts to quantify injury probability utilizing machine learning have been met with renewed interest, and the development of effective models has the potential to supplement the decision-making process of team physicians. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the epidemiology of time-loss lower extremity muscle strains (LEMSs) in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1999 to 2019 and (2) determine the validity of a machine-learning model in predicting injury risk. It was hypothesized that time-loss LEMSs would be infrequent in this cohort and that a machine-learning model would outperform conventional methods in the prediction of injury risk. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Performance data and rates of the 4 major muscle strain injury types (hamstring, quadriceps, calf, and groin) were compiled from the 1999 to 2019 NBA seasons. Injuries included all publicly reported injuries that resulted in lost playing time. Models to predict the occurrence of a LEMS were generated using random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural network, support vector machines, elastic net penalized logistic regression, and generalized logistic regression. Performance was compared utilizing discrimination, calibration, decision curve analysis, and the Brier score. Results: A total of 736 LEMSs resulting in lost playing time occurred among 2103 athletes. Important variables for predicting LEMS included previous number of lower extremity injuries; age; recent history of injuries to the ankle, hamstring, or groin; and recent history of concussion as well as 3-point attempt rate and free throw attempt rate. The XGBoost machine achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.840), calibration, and decision curve analysis. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost outperformed logistic regression in the prediction of a LEMS that will result in lost time. Several variables increased the risk of LEMS, including a history of various lower extremity injuries, recent concussion, and total number of previous injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Several studies have demonstrated that iDAScore is more accurate in predicting pregnancy outcomes in cycles without preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) compared to KIDScore and the Gardner criteria. However, the effectiveness of iDAScore in cycles with PGT-A has not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, this study aims to assess the association between artificial intelligence (AI)-based iDAScore (version 1.0) and pregnancy outcomes in single-embryo transfer (SET) cycles with PGT-A. Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Chung Sun Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan. Patients undergoing SET cycles (n = 482) following PGT-A at a single reproductive center between January 2017 and June 2021. The blastocyst morphology and morphokinetics of all embryos were evaluated using a time-lapse system. The blastocysts were ranked based on the scores generated by iDAScore, which were defined as AI scores, or by KIDScore D5 (version 3.2) following the manufacturer’s protocols. A single blastocyst without aneuploidy was transferred after examining the embryonic ploidy status using a next-generation sequencing-based PGT-A platform. Logistic regression analysis with generalized estimating equations was conducted to assess whether AI scores are associated with the probability of live birth (LB) while considering confounding factors. Results: Logistic regression analysis revealed that AI score was significantly associated with LB probability (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.037, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.632–2.542) when pulsatility index (PI) level and types of chromosomal abnormalities were controlled. Blastocysts were divided into quartiles in accordance with their AI score (group 1: 3.0–7.8; group 2: 7.9–8.6; group 3: 8.7–8.9; and group 4: 9.0–9.5). Group 1 had a lower LB rate (34.6% vs. 59.8–72.3%) and a higher rate of pregnancy loss (26% vs. 4.7–8.9%) compared with the other groups (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis verified that the iDAScore had a significant but limited ability to predict LB (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.64); this ability was significantly weaker than that of the combination of iDAScore, type of chromosomal abnormalities, and PI level (AUC = 0.67). In the comparison of the LB groups with the non-LB groups, the AI scores were significantly lower in the non-LB groups, both for euploid (median: 8.6 vs. 8.8) and mosaic (median: 8.0 vs. 8.6) SETs. Conclusions: Although its predictive ability can be further enhanced, the AI score was significantly associated with LB probability in SET cycles. Euploid or mosaic blastocysts with low AI scores (≤ 7.8) were associated with a lower LB rate, indicating the potential of this annotation-free AI system as a decision-support tool for deselecting embryos with poor pregnancy outcomes following PGT-A. © 2024, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This article studies figurative uses of metaphors and metonymies utilized to frame the discourse of transplantology. We assume a somewhat wider view of framing than is usually found in the literature and argue that framing effects can be observed on a cline stretching from the private to the institutional pole. We combine this approach with the findings of the prospect theory that distinguishes between gain-framing and loss-framing as two strategic choices in tackling an issue in discourse. The framing tools, as we show in our analysis of authentic materials, in order to be effective need to be adapted to the section of, or the point on, the cline occupied by a particular subtype of discourse. Although the focus in the cognitive linguistic literature is on how conceptual metaphors are employed in framing discourse, we point out that metonymies, interacting with these metaphors, can also play a very important role. The framing tools used in public campaign aimed at winning new organ donors are strategically mostly gain-framed, and as a rule globally based on the GIFT metaphor. It seems that the metaphorical use of GIFT as a global choice in institutional contexts is not very efficient since it is too general and vague to make discourse more persuasive at the personal level, as expected in the light of the exemplification theory. This metaphor is more effective when adapted accordingly, as we demonstrated on some campaigns supported by or based on metonymic presentation of various aspects stressing the quality of life after transplantation. © 2020, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University.

Parasitosis is a life threatening disease and has been reported from Thailand, Japan, South of Taiwan (Kaoh-Siung), Korea, Iran, Egypt, Italy and Spain. Its clinical symptoms are characterized by chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, borborygmus, marked weight loss, protein and electrolyte loss and cachexia. Capillariasis may be fatal if early treatment is not given. We reported 14 cases living in rural areas of Taiwan. Three cases had histories of travelling to Thailand. They might have been infected in Thailand while stayed there. Two cases had the diet of raw freshwater fish before. Three cases received emergency laparotomy due to peritonitis and two cases were found of enteritis cystica profunda. According to the route of transmission, freshwater and brackish-water fish may act as the intermediate host of the parasite. The most simple and convenient method of diagnosing capillariasis is stool examination. Two cases were diagnosed by histology. Mebendazole or albendezole 200 mg orally twice a day for 20-30 d is the treatment of choice. All the patients were cured, and relapses were not observed within 12 mo.

      " Abstract: We examine the optimal size of risk pools with moral hazard. In risk pools, the effective share of the own loss borne is the sum of the direct share (the retention rate) and the indirect share borne as residual claimant. In a model with identical individuals with mixed risk-averse utility functions, we show that the effective share required to implement a specific effort increases in the pool size. This is a downside of larger pools as it, ceteris paribus, reduces risk sharing. However, we find that the benefit from diversifying the risk in larger pools always outweighs the downside of a higher effective share. We conclude that, absent transaction costs, the optimal pool size converges to infinity.

      " Abstract: Present-day publications on human genes primarily feature genes that already appeared in many publications prior to completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. These patterns persist despite the subsequent adoption of high-throughput technologies, which routinely identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. Although several hypotheses for bias in the selection of genes as research targets have been proposed, their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of-omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain abandoned by studies that cite these-omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of-omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we condense our insights into a tool, find my understudied genes (FMUG), that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging.

      " Abstract: Landslides are considered to be one of the most significant natural hazards. Detection of landslide-prone zones is an important phase in landslide hazard assessment and mitigation of landslide-related losses. AHP as one of the most effective methods for GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis is increasingly being used in susceptibility mapping. However, its weights have some degree of uncertainty that interval comparison matrix (ICM) method can be used to deal with this problem. The importance of this study is to propose an interval number distance-based region-growing (IDRG) method based on ICM for the identification of landslide-prone zones in the Urmia lake basin, Iran. To assess the capability of the proposed IDRG method, a landslide susceptibility map was produced using common AHP, too. To generate the maps, the weights of nine conditioning factors were determined using both traditional pairwise comparison matrices of the AHP method and ICM. The accuracy of the produced maps was assessed through ROC (receiver operating curve) and using a dataset of known landslide occurrences. The results indicate an improvement in accuracy of about 11% by identifying the landslide-prone zones using the IDRG method. This improvement was achieved by minimizing the uncertainty associated with criteria ranking/weighting in a traditional AHP and identifying the prone zones as areas instead of pixels. Finally, the robustness of the proposed method was demonstrated by sensitivity analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Internal hemipelvectomy may be indicated in the treatment of select tumors of the pelvis and lower extremity, and has become our preferred approach due to favorable outcomes. After such extensive resections, which can involve long operative times and significant blood loss, there are often substantial bony and soft tissue deficits. However, it is unclear whether the benefits of reconstruction in these cases outweigh the risks involved. In the largest series to date of internal hemipelvectomy patients, we evaluate the effect of reconstruction on surgical complications, postoperative function, and survival. A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent internal hemipelvectomy between 1998 and 2011. Outcomes for patients who underwent reconstruction were compared to outcomes for those who did not. A total of 111 patients underwent internal hemipelvectomy, of which 51 (45.9%) received reconstruction and 60 (54.1%) did not. In cases of reconstruction, 30 (58.8%) involved placement of mesh for abdominal wall and pelvic floor reconstruction, 27 (52.9%) involved a soft tissue flap, and 15 (29.4%) involved a vascularized bone flap to restore pelvic ring continuity. Two concurrent reconstructive procedures were performed in 22 (43.1%) patients. The overall rate of early complications was 19.8%, which occurred in 15.7% of patients who received reconstruction compared to 23.3% in patients who did not (P = 0.35). Late recipient-site complications occurred significantly less often in patients who underwent reconstruction (7.8% vs 26.7%, respectively; P = 0.01). From a functional standpoint, Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores were higher in patients who underwent reconstruction, although this was not statistically significant (62.8% vs 48.4%, respectively; P = 0.12). The 2 groups were similar with regard to operative time, blood loss, and hospital stay, as well as overall and disease-free survival rates. Overall, these results indicate that immediate reconstruction of internal hemipelvectomy defects significantly reduces the incidence of late recipient-site complications, without an adverse effect on perioperative course or overall function. An algorithm for reconstruction based on these outcomes is presented. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Calculating the disease burden due to injury is complex, as it requires many methodological choices. Until now, an overview of the methodological design choices that have been made in burden of disease (BoD) studies in injury populations is not available. The aim of this systematic literature review was to identify existing injury BoD studies undertaken across Europe and to comprehensively review the methodological design choices and assumption parameters that have been made to calculate years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) in these studies. Methods: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, and the grey literature supplemented by handsearching, for BoD studies. We included injury BoD studies that quantified the BoD expressed in YLL, YLD, and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) in countries within the European Region between early-1990 and mid-2021. Results: We retrieved 2,914 results of which 48 performed an injury-specific BoD assessment. Single-country independent and Global Burden of Disease (GBD)-linked injury BoD studies were performed in 11 European countries. Approximately 79% of injury BoD studies reported the BoD by external cause-of-injury. Most independent studies used the incidence-based approach to calculate YLDs. About half of the injury disease burden studies applied disability weights (DWs) developed by the GBD study. Almost all independent injury studies have determined YLL using national life tables. Conclusions: Considerable methodological variation across independent injury BoD assessments was observed; differences were mainly apparent in the design choices and assumption parameters towards injury YLD calculations, implementation of DWs, and the choice of life table for YLL calculations. Development and use of guidelines for performing and reporting of injury BoD studies is crucial to enhance transparency and comparability of injury BoD estimates across Europe and beyond. © 2022, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This retrospective review of the largest United States kidney exchange reports characteristics, utilization, and recipient outcomes of kidneys with simple compared to complex anatomy and extrapolates reluctance to accept these kidneys. Of 3105 transplants performed, only 12.8% were right kidneys and 23.1% had multiple renal arteries. 59.3% of centers used fewer right kidneys than expected and 12.1% transplanted zero right kidneys or kidneys with more than 1 artery. Five centers transplanted a third of these kidneys (35.8% of right kidneys and 36.7% of kidneys with multiple renal arteries). 22.5% and 25.5% of centers currently will not entertain a match offer for a left or right kidney with more than one artery, respectively. There were no significant differences in all-cause graft failure or death-censored graft loss for kidneys with multiple arteries, and a very small increased risk of graft failure for right kidneys versus left of limited clinical relevance for most recipients. Kidneys with complex anatomy can be used with excellent outcomes at many centers. Variation in use (lack of demand) for these kidneys reduces the number of transplants, so systems to facilitate use could increase demand.

      " Abstract: Rule acquisition is one of the main purposes in the analysis of formal decision contexts. In general, given a formal decision context, some of its objects may not be essential to the rule acquisition. This study investigates the issue of reducing the object set of a formal decision context without losing the decision rule information provided by the entire set of objects. Using concept lattices, we propose a theoretical framework of object compression for formal decision contexts. And under this framework, it is proved that the set of all the non-redundant decision rules obtained from the reduced database is sound and complete with respect to the initial formal decision context. Furthermore, a complete algorithm is developed to compute a reduct of a formal decision context. The analysis of some real-life databases demonstrates that the proposed object compression method can largely reduce the size of a formal decision context and it can remove much more objects than both the techniques of clarified context and row reduced context. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

      " Abstract: Aims: This study aimed to corroborate the main hypotetized dimensions of diabetes burnout, and its distinction from diabetes distress and depressive symptoms among adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was employed to collect data from 31 eligible participants using semi-structured individual phone interviews. Participants were recruited through purposive sampling among a larger sample of adults with T1D in a previous study. Data was analyzed using qualitative content analysis including immersion, reduction, and interpretation. Results: Exhaustion and detachment were frequent manifestations of diabetes burnout that often accompanied by instances during which participants experienced a loss of control over diabetes. Whereas individuals’ support systems could either help or hinder diabetes burnout. Participants saw burnout as separate but closely related to distress and depressive symptoms, with some suggesting correlations among burnout, distress, and depressive symptoms, while others expressed that distress caused their burnout and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Diabetes burnout reflects a significant yet unexplored concept which might explain the complexities of suboptimal self-management and poor diabetes outcomes. Emerging evidence suggesting diabetes burnout as a distinct concept calls for more studies to mitigate diabetes burnout as an obstacle to optimal diabetes care. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: To identify factors that are associated with why parents of deaf children who have had GJB2/GJB6 testing as part of a genetics research study do or do not take their children for genetics evaluation. Methods: Self-administered questionnaire was completed by parents of a deaf child participating in a GJB2/GJB6 testing study. Results: A total of 30 parents (representing 24 children) completed the questionnaire; 11 of 24 children (46%) underwent a genetics evaluation. Compared with parents who did not take their child for a genetics evaluation, those who did were more likely to (1) have supportive pediatricians, (2) feel it was important or would be helpful to their child, (3) recall the recommendation for evaluation, (4) have family members who wanted the child to have an evaluation, and (5) be Hispanic or Asian. Genetic test results, knowledge of genetics evaluation, psychosocial factors, language concerns, or structural factors were not substantively associated with attending a genetics evaluation. Conclusion: Parental perceptions, family environment, and pediatricians play a role in decisions regarding genetics evaluation. Because genetic testing for deafness likely will occur outside of traditional genetics clinics and without comprehensive genetics evaluation, efforts to increase pediatricians’ awareness of the usefulness of genetics evaluation may be essential to ensure appropriate care for deaf and hard-of-hearing children as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: In patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), ATM and BRCA2 mutations dictate differences in PARPi inhibitor response and other therapies. We interrogated the molecular features of ATM- and BRCA2-mutated mPC to explain the divergent clinical outcomes and inform future treatment decisions. Experimental Design: We examined a novel set of 1,187 mPCs after excluding microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors. We stratified these based on ATM (n ¼ 88) or BRCA2 (n ¼ 98) mutations. As control groups, mPCs with mutations in 12 other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes were considered non-BRCA2/ ATM HRR-deficient (HRDother, n ¼ 193), whereas lack of any HRR mutations were considered HRR-proficient (HRP; n ¼ 808). Gene expression analyses were performed using Limma. Real-world overall survival was determined from insurance claims data. Results: In noncastrate mPCs, only BRCA2-mutated mPCs exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. In castrate mPCs, both ATM and BRCA2 mutations exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. ATM-mutated mPCs had reduced TP53 mutations and harbored coamplification of 11q13 genes, including CCND1 and genes in the FGF family. BRCA2-mutated tumors showed elevated genomic loss-of-heterozygosity scores and were often tumor mutational burden high. BRCA2-mutated mPCs had upregulation of cell-cycle genes and were enriched in cell-cycle signaling programs. This was distinct from ATM-mutated tumors. Conclusions: Tumoral ATM and BRCA2 mutations are associated with differential clinical outcomes when patients are stratified by treatments, including hormonal or taxane therapies. ATM- and BRCA2-mutated tumors exhibited differences in co-occurring molecular features.

      " Abstract: In a mobile ad hoc network, which is self-organized and operates without any fundamental infrastructure, packet transmission from the source node to the destination node is completed after sending the route request and route reply. A reliable path is then selected depending on the protocol choice. Data that the sender intends to deliver is broken up into packets and given sequence numbers before being transmitted over the channel. With the aid of an internal buffer that helps to receive packets and forward them to the next destination, each and every packet travels along the allotted path until it reaches its destination. If there is more traffic on the MANET, the buffer may overflow, which will result in packet loss during transmission.. The source node must retransmit to the destination if any packets were lost during the initial transfer. This article proposes the Intelligent Buffer Management (IBM) active buffer management algorithm to prevent such a scenario by enhancing the MANET nodes' buffers to prevent packet loss. The Network Simulator is used to help build this suggested approach, and the results are compared to those of the current buffer management method to show that IBM is superior. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

      " Abstract: Identifying oral cancer lesions associated with high risk of relapse and predicting clinical outcome remain challenging questions in clinical practice. Genomic alterations may add prognostic information and indicate biological aggressiveness thereby emphasizing the need for genome-wide profiling of oral cancers. High-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization was performed to delineate the genomic alterations in clinically annotated primary gingivo-buccal complex and tongue cancers (n = 60). The specific genomic alterations so identified were evaluated for their potential clinical relevance. Copy-number changes were observed on chromosomal arms with most frequent gains on 3q (60%), 5p (50%), 7p (50%), 8q (73%), 11q13 (47%), 14q11.2 (47%), and 19p13.3 (58%) and losses on 3p14.2 (55%) and 8p (83%). Univariate statistical analysis with correction for multiple testing revealed chromosomal gain of region 11q22.1-q22.2 and losses of 17p13.3 and 11q23-q25 to be associated with loco-regional recurrence (P=0.004, P = 0.003, and P=0.0003) and shorter survival (P=0.009, P = 0.003, and P 0.0001) respectively. The gain of 11q22 and loss of 11q23-q25 were validated by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization (I-FISH).

      " Abstract: Emergency decision-making processes, always require decision makers (DMs)to express the majority of their opinions in linguistic terms (LTs). Since there are, in most cases, many more people than pure DMs participating in the decision-making process, probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs)are suitable to express the decision information. A typical feature of emergency decision-making is that even minor errors in the decision process may have dire consequences. Accurate decision information and the consequent handling of that information are absolutely essential. We show that there are significant drawbacks in the existing operational laws for PLTSs, which may result in faulty decisions. In order to address the issue, in this paper, we propose some new operational laws for PLTSs based on D-S evidence theory and discuss the properties of these new operational laws and advance a probabilistic linguistic weighted averaging operator based on D-S evidence theory (DS-PLWA). Our aggregating method can keep the form of PLTS and avoid information loss. In addition, we propose a novel comparison method for PLTSs and a method to obtain the criteria weights based on maximising deviation for the evidences. On this basis, we propose an emergency decision-making style based on D-S evidence theory and apply it to a known details of a serious mine accident that happened in Pingyi, Shandong province. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Forequarter amputation (FQA) is the surgical treatment of choice for tumours in the upper extremity and shoulder girdle that infiltrate the neurovascular bundle, shoulder joint and muscles of the shoulder girdle in non-salvageable cases. In both curative and palliative settings, FQA can serve as an effective oncological treatment for local control of tumour. Methods: All patients who underwent FQA in our unit from January 2016 till August 2019 for oncological indications were included in our study and their clinical outcomes were calculated. Results: Thirteen patients were included in the study including 8 male patients. Mean age of patients at surgery was 20 years (Range 10-53 years) with a minimum follow up of 6 months or till patient was deceased earlier. Six patients had primary osteosarcoma, 4 had Ewing's sarcoma, 2 had Spindle cell sarcoma while 1 had Giant cell tumour. Six patients underwent surgery with curative intent. No major per operative complication was encountered in any of the cases with a mean blood loss of 350 ml and mean duration of surgery being 75 minutes. At last, follow up only 6 patients were alive, with 2 patients alive with disease (Metastasis) and undergoing palliative treatment. None of our patients had local recurrence. Mean survivorship for the whole cohort was 9.2 months (Range 3-18 months) with a mean survivorship for the deceased group was 7.1 months (Range 3-16 months) and mean survivorship for alive patients was 11.6 months (range 9-18 months). All the alive patients had phantom limb sensations and only one had a prosthesis in place only for cosmetic reasons, at last follow up. Conclusion: Although FQA is a significantly body disfiguring procedure, but in large tumours of shoulder girdle, this is a viable option for local control of the disease. Based on our study, although relatively small sample size, we propose the combined anteroposterior approach to be safe and reliable for advanced shoulder girdle tumours. © 2022 Authors.

These patients are not ideal patients for DIEP flap surgery because of having poor perforators, previous abdominal operations, low body mass index, or previously used/failed DIEP flap. In their institution, the authors have performed stacked profunda artery perforator flaps for these patients to provide full volumetric and aesthetic reconstruction. Methods: A retrospective review of 20 patients (40 flaps) who underwent stacked profunda artery perforator flap surgery from 2014 to 2018 was performed. Patient characteristics, demographics, and flap data were collected. Results: Forty flaps were used to reconstruct 20 breasts in 20 patients. The mean age of patients was 51.5 years (range, 38 to 74 years), the average body mass index was 27.3 kg/m                             2                              (range, 21.0 to 34.4 kg/m                             2                             ), and the mean flap weight was 398.5 g (range, 170 to 600 g). The majority of anastomoses were performed in internal mammary vessels (60 percent), followed by thoracodorsal (10 percent), serratus (10 percent), and side branch of profunda artery perforator vessels (20 percent). There were no flap losses, and two patients experienced donor-site wound dehiscence. Conclusions: Stacking profunda artery perforator flaps is an innovative yet technically challenging choice of flap for autologous breast reconstruction. It can provide an aesthetically pleasing result in the appropriately selected patient, and we recommend this technique in patients who are not optimal candidates for DIEP flap surgery because of previous flap failure or unavailable donor site.

      " Abstract: In response to the increasing demand for efficient resource utilization in data center networks (DCNs), the development of intelligent load-balancing algorithms has become crucial. This article introduces the dual double deep Q network (D (Formula presented.) DQN) algorithm, designed for software-defined networking (SDN) environments within data centers. By leveraging deep reinforcement learning, D (Formula presented.) DQN addresses the challenges posed by dynamic traffic patterns, diverse flow requirements, and the coexistence of elephant and mice flows. Our algorithm adopts a comprehensive SDN approach, evaluating the network's status by analyzing switch load and bandwidth utilization. Using convolutional neural networks for elephant and mice flows in DCN, our algorithm enables adaptive learning and training tailored to the specific demands of elephant flows. Employing a double deep Q network architecture (DDQN), D (Formula presented.) DQN optimizes paths for both elephant and mice flows independently. Real-time adaptation mechanisms make routing decisions based on the robust learning capabilities of DDQN, enhancing network utilization and reducing packet loss by generating optimal forwarding paths according to the current network state and traffic patterns. Simulations conducted in a Mininet environment with RYU as the controller, utilizing a fat-tree data center topology, validate the efficacy of D (Formula presented.) DQN.

      " Abstract: Anti-HLA DSAs are associated with ABMR and graft loss in KT recipients, yet the influence of DSA IgG subclass on outcomes in pediatric KT recipients is not completely understood. We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of pediatric KT recipients with anti-HLA DSAs, aiming to study the association between specific DSA IgG subclasses and graft outcomes, including ABMR and significant graft dysfunction (graft loss or 50% decrease in eGFR). Thirty-six patients (mean age 15.4y) with DSAs initially detected 1 month-14.3 years post-transplantation were followed for a median of 2.8 years. Rates of IgG1, 2, 3, and 4 subclass detection were 92%, 33%, 58%, and 25%, respectively. Twenty-two patients (61%) had clinical ABMR, whereas 19% had subclinical ABMR, and 13 (36%) experienced significant graft dysfunction. Patients with IgG3+ DSAs had a higher risk of graft dysfunction compared with IgG3- patients (52% vs 13%, P =.03). In a multiple Cox proportional regression analysis, the presence of IgG3+ DSA was independently associated with significant graft dysfunction (HR 10.45, 95% CI 1.97-55.55, P =.006). In conclusion, IgG3 subclass DSAs are associated with graft dysfunction and may be useful for risk stratification and treatment decisions in DSA-positive pediatric KT recipients. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

      " Abstract: In this paper we discuss the relationship between prospective and retrospective sampling problems. Estimates of the parameter of interest may be obtained by solving suitable estimating equations under both sampling schemes. Most common examples of such estimates include the maximum likelihood estimates. Some classical results and more recent development of the first-order asymptotic relationship between the estimators are reviewed. High-order expansions are given for the distributions of the retrospective estimators. Expansions for the marginal distributions of interest are obtained for both prospective and retrospective data. Furthermore, it is shown that the two expansions are asymptotically equal, at least up to order O(n-1). This implies that readily available prospective saddlepoint methods may be applied to the analysis of retrospective data without loss of high-order accuracy. The results are also briefly illustrated numerically. © 1999 Biometrika Trust.\u001b[0m :\n",

The subject heard noise alone (white noise) or a signal superimposed on the noise (1000-Hz tone) and had to report what he heard in each trial. Risk situations were manipulated by changing the monetary reward and penalty associated with correct and incorrect responses. Eight male volunteers participated in this study. It was found that under anaesthetic influence they did not avoid the same risks which had been avoided under control conditions.

      " Abstract: Embryonic stem cells co-express Oct4 and Oct1, a related protein with similar DNAbinding specificity. To study the role of Oct1 in ESC pluripotency and transcriptional control, we constructed germline and inducible-conditional Oct1-deficient ESC lines. ESCs lacking Oct1 show normal appearance, self-renewal and growth but manifest defects upon differentiation. They fail to form beating cardiomyocytes, generate neurons poorly, form small, poorly differentiated teratomas, and cannot generate chimeric mice. Upon RA-mediated differentiation, Oct1-deficient cells induce lineage-appropriate developmentally poised genes poorly while lineage-inappropriate genes, including extra-embryonic genes, are aberrantly expressed. In ESCs, Oct1 co-occupies a specific set of targets with Oct4, but does not occupy differentially expressed developmental targets. Instead, Oct1 occupies these targets as cells differentiate and Oct4 declines. These results identify a dynamic interplay between Oct1 and Oct4, in particular during the critical window immediately after loss of pluripotency when cells make the earliest developmental fate decisions. © Shen et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Population growth, economic globalization and the launch of market economy instruments have become the main triggers for processes related to the anthropogenization of space. According to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics, the developed area indication tripled in the last 25 years. Humans keep appropriating more natural and semi-natural areas, which entails specific social, economic and environmental consequences. Provisions in some countries' laws and some economic factors encourage investors to engage in urbanization. The authors of this study noticed a research gap in the analysis of suburban areas in this topic. Our research aimed to analyze the conversion of plots of land used for agricultural purposes into urbanized land in the city's suburban zone, in areas of high landscape and natural value. We focused on the analysis of geodetic and legal divisions of plots of land and analyzed the conditions of plots of land \"ex ante\" and \"ex post\" and the changes in their values. To achieve the research objective, we used Corine Land Cover (CLC) data for various time intervals, orthophotomaps (using the Web Map Service browsing service compliant with Open Geospatial Consortium standards), cadastral data, administrative decisions, data from the real estate market, spatial analyses and statistical modeling (linear, non-linear and stepwise regression). In general, the CLC data resolution enables analysis at regional or national levels. We used them innovatively at the local level because CLC data allowed us to notice the development of the area over time. Detailed research confirmed that, in the studied area, the conversion of agricultural land into developed areas results from economic factors. The division procedure increases the plot value by about 10%. However, the effects of uncontrolled urbanization, which we are currently dealing with, generate long term social and economic losses, difficulties in the labour market and may become a barrier to development. © 2020 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In making societal decisions concerning hazards with potentially disastrous consequences, it is important to have sound knowledge of how people evaluate the seriousness of disasters. In this study, a group of students evaluated the seriousness of disasters in terms of four basic attributes (and their ranges): number of fatalities (0-1000), number of serious injuries (0-4000), economic loss (SEK 0-40 billion) and cause of the disaster (natural, accidental, terrorism). Attribute weights were elicited by two separate methods, which taken together provide insight into the uncertainty of the elicited weights. Most participants regarded the attributes related to physical harm (especially the number of fatalities) as most serious, a finding that must be seen in relation to the ranges of the attributes. In addition, the cause of a disaster also affected many of the participants' judgements of its seriousness. This paper's findings are of value to societal decision making, particularly in the case of small to medium-sized projects in which specific elicitations of stakeholders' values are rarely made.

It is estimated that more than 246 million individuals have diabetes, with this number expected to increase to 366 million by the year 2030. The chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes is associated with long term damage to various organs, including the eyes, kidneys, nervous system, heart, and vasculature. India has a long history regarding the epidemiology of diabetes. In an effort to optimize glycemic control and also to reduce the burden of diabetic complications, several classes of oral hypoglycemic agents have been developed. Metformin has now been on the market for more than 50 years and has been established as the first-line agent of choice for the management of type 2 diabetes.

Benign and malignant SFTP usually appear as a well-defined, homogeneous, and rounded mass on imaging. Complete en bloc is usually the treatment of choice. Case Presentation: 44 years old gentleman presented with the unintentional weight loss and chest discomfort for 6 months. A CT scan of chest showed a 30 × 20 × 20 cm heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass involving the entire right hemithorax. PET scan showed a localized disease. Therefore, a complete right upper lobectomy and complete removal of mass was done, that resulted in complete expansion of the middle and lower lobe. The patient remains stable till date. Biopsy revealed a fibrous pleural tumor. Conclusion: Complete surgical resection of the tumor is usually sufficient, but there are reported cases with recurrence. Wedge resection for complete excision can be carried out for tumors arising from visceral pleura.

      " Abstract: Background: Total colectomy is the procedure of choice when slow transit constipation (STC) can be confidently diagnosed. A laparoscopic-assisted technique (LTC) may be potentially advantageous over traditional open technique (OTC) in the treatment of this benign condition. Methods: A historical control (non-randomized) study was performed on patients diagnosed to have STC after clinical, anorectal physiologic and transit marker studies. All earlier consecutive patients underwent OTC and the latter consecutive patients underwent LTC. The intra-operative time, blood loss, postoperative ileus recovery, duration of hospitalization and complications were recorded. A bowel function and patient satisfaction questionaire was administered on follow-up. Results: Twenty-four of 411 patients were found to have STC; 17 (2 men, 15 women; mean age, 40 (standard error of mean [SEM] 5) years) underwent OTC and 7 (2 men, 5 women; mean age, 39.5 (SEM 6) years) underwent LTC. There were significant improvements in the stool frequency, need for assisted evacuation and abdominal distension (P < 0.05) after both procedures; 96% were fully satisfied with the resulting bowel function. However, OTC patients were less satisfied with the cosmetic outcome (P < 0.05). Intra-operative time for LTC was longer by a mean 74 min [P < 0.05). Postoperative blood loss, recovery of ileus and hospitalization time were the same in both groups. There were no deaths. The complication rates were 43% for LTC and 24% for OTC. The predominant complication was bowel obstruction for which two patients (both OTC) required adhesiolysis.

The public can hold governments accountable for their policy decisions through reformed tax systems. Governments on their part can predict tax revenues and thus accordingly plan for future actions. Developing countries can improve their tax collection capacity and minimize their long-term dependence on external assistance. The 2002 Monterrey Consensus understood the role of taxation in mobilizing domestic resources. Reforming tax systems requires autonomous revenue services organized by strict visionary tax commissioners, working with well-paid officials within an integrated administration. The International Tax Dialogue, a grouping of the EU, IMF, Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, and the OECD, can offer benchmarks for measuring and guiding progress among tax administrations.

      " Abstract: As was true for many school districts across the United States during the early decades of the twentieth century, Houston Independent School District sought modernization through a multimillion dollar building program and curricular reform. Houston's new course of study, heavily influenced by the theories of child-centered pedagogy, received widespread praise from curricular experts at the nation's top schools of education. In the 1920s, Houston was a segregated, southern city that, in many ways, shared the conservatism of the region. Nevertheless, Houston's superintendent, E.E. Oberholtzer, was able to overcome resistance from taxpayers and teachers to successfully implement his program. Corporate élites from the petroleum industry, among the biggest boosters of progressive educational reform in Houston, believed that a child-centered curriculum would develop the leadership skills and creative ability needed to train white-collar workers for the expanding economy. Those left behind, primarily students of color, were further disadvantaged in the changing job market. Jim Crow was an essential component to the success of the reform policies in Houston. As twenty-five per cent of the population, African-American students deserved twenty-five per cent of the district's revenues. Segregation allowed the district to use almost one hundred per cent of the money for curriculum reform on only seventy-five per cent of the population. Nevertheless, Houston manufacturers were dependent on unskilled black labor and were hit hard by the exodus of the Great Migration. Thus, corporate élites could not be too blatant in their discrimination against African-Americans. The pro-industry school board responded to the threats of migration and the demands of Houston's vociferous black press by building two new modern African-American high schools, refurbishing \"Old Colored High School,\" and vastly improving the number and condition of elementary schools for black children. Yet, although these new schools did represent a vast improvement over black education before Oberholtzer's arrival in Houston, in the face of massive expenditures and dramatic improvements in white education, the material gains of black students lagged far behind the educational opportunities for white students. While the new, child-centered curriculum excluded black students (except for the heroic efforts of individual black educators), curriculum development excluded the vast majority of teachers. White teachers lost considerable power over pedagogical decisions in their own classrooms as they faced onerous, top-down directives. The district maintained control over teacher education by opening a junior college in 1927 to train white teachers according to the new pedagogy. Many white teachers resented the district's efforts to tie salary raises to increased educational qualifications, even for experienced teachers. In 1928 conflicts with the superintendent contributed to the growth of new memberships in the all-white Houston Teachers Association. In response, the school district passed a significant salary increase for white teachers that was funded partially by reducing the automatic annual increases in black teacher salaries. Intense job competition within African-American schools kept black teachers from protesting their discriminatory salaries and treatment. Ironically, many black teachers, excluded from training in child-centered pedagogy, welcomed additional educational opportunities. Black teachers themselves fought for the creation of Houston Junior College for Negroes, although the new college failed to receive adequate funding. Thus, the school administration modernized white schools by denying new educational opportunities to black students and teachers. While many scholars have criticized the supposed \"advantages\" of progressive education, in Houston, at least, progressivism operated as another form of unearned white privilege. © 2003 Stichting Paedagogica Historica.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Naturally occurring biodegradation of hydrocarbon compounds may offer a sustainable management option at contaminated sites. However, a sound understanding of contami- nant mass loss rates is required to enable estimation of source zone longevity, serving to alleviate public concerns and inform decision makers. Under some conditions, surficial CO2 efflux measurements can be useful to delineate petroleum hydrocarbon containing source zones, and to provide estimates of depth-integrated vadose zone hydrocarbon degrada- tion rates. However, the accuracy of degradation rate estimates is limited by our ability to separate CO2 effluxes associated with contaminant decomposition from those atiributable to naturally occurring soil respiration. To understand CO2 sources and transport processes within the vadose zone, this work combines measurement of surficial CO2 effluxes with detailed analysis of soil gas composition- including the radiocarbon and stable isotopic composition of CO2. Quantitative reactive transport modeling allows further evaluation of controls on CO2 generation and fate, and CH4 generation and oxidation. Results confirm that, in the source zone at the Bemidji site, the majority of CO2 originates from degradation of the oil body. In addition, radiocarbon in CO2 proves particularly useful in determining the contribution of contaminant degradation to the measured CO2 efflux. © Soil Science Society of America.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this paper, we first model the scheduling problem by the Markov Decision Process (MDP), and then propose an ϵ-optimal scheduling algorithm based on this model. Considering the curse of dimensionality of the MDP-based model, we further model the scheduling problem by the restless multi-armed bandit model. Based on the model, we prove the indexability of the scheduling problem and derive the closed-form Whittle's index. According to the closed-form index, we thus propose an index-based scheduling algorithm that has very low time complexity. Finally, numerous simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The ϵ-optimal scheduling algorithm converges very fast to optimal solutions with small-sized networks and small ϵ.

Since the laboratory cannot simulate the actual leakage size of the lost formation and the corresponding leakage plugging process at the drilling site, the laboratory experiment results cannot reflect the actual leakage plugging construction effect. Aiming at the problem of frequent fracture leakage during drilling in Chepaizi block, Xinjiang, China, this paper proposes a set of machine learning methods based on a neural network. Three types of factors and 14 parameters with a strong correlation with the leakage control effect were screened out. Three categories of factors include construction parameters, choice of plugging material, and fluid properties of the carrier fluid. The training was carried out based on the collected field data, the appropriate activation function was set, and the deep well network structure was optimized. By improving the field plugging measures in the later period, the model was verified by these actual cases, and the results showed that the established model produced the highest R2 of 0.974, has a good fit, and predicts well.  © 2022 Lei Pu et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: There are no evidence-based recommendations on the optimal time point to initiate non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of early versus delayed initiation of NOAC in these patients. Methods: TIMING (Timing of Oral Anticoagulant Therapy in Acute Ischemic Stroke With Atrial Fibrillation) was a registry-based, randomized, noninferiority, open-label, blinded end-point study at 34 stroke units using the Swedish Stroke Register for enrollment and follow-up. Within 72 hours from stroke onset, patients were randomized to early (≤4 days) or delayed (5-10 days) NOAC initiation, with choice of NOAC at the investigators' discretion. The primary outcome was the composite of recurrent ischemic stroke, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage, or all-cause mortality at 90 days. The prespecified noninferiority margin was 3%. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Results: Between April 2, 2017, and December 30, 2020, 888 patients were randomized to either early (n=450) or delayed (n=438) initiation of NOAC. No patient was lost to 90-day follow-up. Mean age was 78.3 years (SD, 9.9 years); 46.2% were women; 49.1% had previously known atrial fibrillation; and 17.5% prior stroke. The primary outcome occurred in 31 patients (6.89%) assigned to early initiation and in 38 patients (8.68%) assigned to delayed NOAC initiation (absolute risk difference, -1.79% [95% CI, -5.31% to 1.74%]; Pnoninferiority=0.004). Ischemic stroke rates were 3.11% and 4.57% (risk difference, -1.46% [95% CI, -3.98% to 1.07%]) and all-cause mortality rates were 4.67% and 5.71% (risk difference, -1.04% [95% CI, -3.96% to 1.88%]) in the early and delayed groups, respectively. No patient in either group experienced symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Conclusions: Early initiation was noninferior to delayed start of NOAC after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. Numerically lower rates of ischemic stroke and death and the absence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhages implied that the early start of NOAC was safe and should be considered for acute secondary stroke prevention in patients eligible for NOAC treatment.

      " Abstract: Background: Homologous recombination is an important DNA repair mechanism, which deficiency is a common feature of many cancers. Defining homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) status can provide information for treatment decisions of cancer patients. HRD score is a widely accepted method to evaluate HRD status. This study aimed to explored HRD in gastric cancer (GC) patients’ clinical outcomes with genes related to HRD score and HRD components score [HRD-loss of heterozygosity (LOH), large-scale state transitions (LST), and telomeric allelic imbalance (NtAI)]. Methods: Based on LOH, NtAI scores, LST, and integrated HRD scores-related genes, a risk model for stratifying 346 TCGA GC cases were developed by Cox regression analysis and LASSO Cox regression. The risk scores of 33 cancers in TCGA were calculated to analyze the relationship between risk scores of each cancer and HRD scores and 3 HRD component scores. Relationship between the risk model and patient survival, BRCA1, BRCA2 mutation, response to Cisplatin and Talazoparib treatment was analyzed by generating Kaplan-Meier curve, mutations waterfall map and conducting Pearson correlation analysis. Results: An gene signature was constructed based on 11 HRD scores-related gene (BEX2, C1QL2, DKK1, DRC1, GLUD2, HCAR1, IGFBP1, NXPH1, PROC, SERPINA5, and SLCA1A2). Risk groups were stratified by risk score. Prognosis of the high-risk score group was worse than the low-risk ones. Risk score was associated with BRCA2 mutation, and patients grouped according to BRCA2 mutation status had distinguishable risk score, NtAI score, HRD-LOH, LST, and HRD scores. The low-score group showed higher sensitivity to Cisplatin and Talazoparib. The risk score of adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), sarcoma (SARC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) was significantly positively correlated with HRD score. Conclusion: We developed an 11 HRD scores-related genes risk model and revealed the potential association between HRD status and GC prognosis, gene mutations, patients’ sensitivity to therapeutic drugs.

      " Abstract: Hydrocarbon supply chain (HCSC) is a complex network that extends from oil and gas fields to demand nodes. Integrating operation and maintenance activities along this complex network is crucial since the hydrocarbon industry is the most influential sector in the world economy, and any disruptions or variations in hydrocarbon product supply will affect the whole world economy. Therefore, effective and thoughtful maintenance extends the life of an asset and enhances its reliability. To prevent huge losses in production and ultimately satisfy customer needs, the maintenance jobs are preferred to be performed during times of low demand. Thus, operation planning and maintenance scheduling decisions are dependent and should be optimized simultaneously. Therefore, the aim of this study is to develop an integrated mathematical model for the operation and maintenance planning of the oil and gas supply chain. The utility of the proposed model has been demonstrated using the Saudi Arabian HCSC. The proposed model effectively produces optimal operation and maintenance schedule decisions. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the effect of critical parameters on the obtained results. © 2020 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The development of lightweight, low energy and small-sized sensors incorporated with the wireless networks has brought about a phenomenal growth of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in its different fields of applications. Moreover, the routing of data is crucial in a wide number of critical applications that includes ecosystem monitoring, military and disaster management. However, the time-delay, energy imbalance and minimized network lifetime are considered as the key problems faced during the process of data transmission. Furthermore, only when the functionality of cluster head selection is available in WSNs, it is possible to improve energy and network lifetime. Besides that, the task of cluster head selection is regarded as an NP-hard optimization problem that can be effectively modelled using hybrid metaheuristic approaches. Due to this reason, an Improved Coyote Optimization Algorithm-based Clustering Technique (ICOACT) is proposed for extending the lifetime for making efficient choices for cluster heads while maintaining a consistent balance between exploitation and exploration. The issue of premature convergence and its tendency of being trapped into the local optima in the Improved Coyote Optimization Algorithm (ICOA) through the selection of center solution is used for replacing the best solution in the search space during the clustering functionality. The simulation results of the proposed ICOACT confirmed its efficiency by increasing the number of alive nodes, the total number of clusters formed with the least amount of end-to-end delay and mean packet loss rate.

      " Abstract: Climate change is increasingly challenging the ability of millions of people to sustain livelihoods as the places where they live become uninhabitable. The relocation of populations as individuals, households, and communities within countries and across international borders demonstrates the complexity of climate change impacts. Looking at the literature, some researchers argue that relocation caused by climate change can be an effective strategy to adapt to localized changes, whereas others argue that the movement away from ones' homeland is more neatly captured in the climate change lexicon as ‘loss and damage’. We argue here that the relocation of people as a result of the impacts of climate change can be both adaptation and loss and damage. Drawing on examples from Alaska and Kiribati, we show that dividing this issue between the two concepts is unhelpful in resolving key issues around the types of appropriate support for these transitions to sustain and protect livelihoods and to open up possibilities for self-determined futures. Policy Relevance Climate-induced relocation poses a significant challenge for the populations affected as well as the government agencies tasked with providing technical assistance and funding. At present, policies and institutional frameworks have not yet been developed to accommodate these challenges, despite the urgent need to do so. When the relocation of populations can be planned, participatory, and people centred, then it can be an adaptation strategy that will protect people from the permanent loss of land and livelihoods. If these movements are decided, driven, managed, and undertaken by those affected, then there is the potential for the relocation to also be a transformative opportunity for people to respond to the impacts of climate change, and sustain their livelihoods and possibly even improve certain livelihood outcomes. However, these relocations also cause significant loss and damage. The extent of the loss and damage will partly depend on the ability to have these relocations planned and ensure that human rights protections are embedded in institutional frameworks.

This study is aimed at identifying the best performing algorithm and the most relevant characteristics to categorise individuals with HIV/AIDS at high risk of dementia from the application of data mining. Principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used and tested comparatively between the following machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, KNN, and random forest. The database used for this study was built from the data collection of 270 individuals infected with HIV/AIDS and followed up at the outpatient clinic of a reference hospital for infectious and parasitic diseases in the State of Ceará, Brazil, from January to April 2019. Also, the performance of the algorithms was analysed for the 104 characteristics available in the database; then, with the reduction of dimensionality, there was an improvement in the quality of the machine learning algorithms and identified that during the tests, even losing about 30% of the variation. Besides, when considering only 23 characteristics, the precision of the algorithms was 86% in random forest, 56% logistic regression, 68% decision tree, 60% KNN, and 59% neural network. The random forest algorithm proved to be more effective than the others, obtaining 84% precision and 86% accuracy.  © 2021 Luana Ibiapina Cordeiro Calíope Pinheiro et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The usefulness of a reversed hemisoleus muscle flap as a local reconstructive option for soft-tissue coverage of an open tibial wound in the lower third of the leg has never been acknowledged. Over the past 2 years, 8 patients underwent soft-tissue reconstruction of an open tibial wound (3 X 3 to 10 X 6 cm) in the lower third of the leg with the reversed medial hemisoleus muscle flap modified by the author. The flap was dissected with attention to preserve several critical perforators from the posterior tibial vessels to the flap as possible while allowing adequate turnover of the flap to cover the exposed tibia or hardware. There was no total flap loss, and limb salvage was achieved in all patients. Only 2 patients developed insignificant distal flap necrosis, and they were treated subsequently with debridement and flap readvancement. All patients had reliable healing of their tibial wounds, with good reconstructive and cosmetic outcomes of their flap reconstructions during follow-up. Therefore, the author believes that the reversed medial hemisoleus muscle flap can be a good choice for soft-tissue coverage of a sizable open tibial wound in the lower third of the leg and may be used successfully to replace free tissue transfer in selected patients.

      " Abstract: Mahatma Gandhi’s 1938 statement that ‘Palestine belongs to the Arabs’ has not lost its relevance even after India reversed its four-decade-old policy of recognition-without-relations and normalised relations with Israel in January 1992. Critics see growing Indo-Israeli relations as an abandonment of Gandhian values while supporters use the 1938 statement to reiterate India’s continued support for the Palestinians. ‘Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French!’(Gandhi, ‘The Jews’). This November 1938 remark by Mahatma Gandhi has been the most widely quoted statement on India’s foreign policy. It is impossible to identify any writing–Indian or foreign–on India’s approach towards the Jews, Israel, or the broader Middle East without this. Interestingly, Gandhi’s observation can be noticed in prominent writings both before and after India normalised relations with Israel in January 1992. Despite the changed circumstances, the continued flagging of Gandhi to explain India’s policy towards Israel and the Arab-Israeli conflict raises an important question: why to cite Gandhi’s pro-Arab statement when Indo-Israeli relations have been blossoming remarkably?

      " Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Stabilisation of partial dentures is an important part of prosthodontic treatment, particularly in patients with an excessive reduction in alveolar bone supporting their abutment teeth. In these cases, overdenture prostheses are one possible treatment choice. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of overdentures on the condition of alveolar bone of the remaining teeth, and to evaluate the overdenture concept in the prosthetic treatment of partially edentulous patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigation was conducted on 22 patients during observation periods of 6 and 10 years. After preparation, all abutment teeth were provided with either amalgam restorations or gold copings. An overdenture in the lower jaw was fabricated for every patient. A special film holder was used to repeat the X-ray procedure in every patient in the same manner. The radiographs were evaluated using the grid scale. The alveolar bone level of all remaining teeth was evaluated on dental films by measuring the distance between the root apex and coronal border of the alveolar bone. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference (p < 0.01) was calculated 6 years after delivery stage between distal alveolar bone levels of experimental abutments under overdentures and the remaining teeth of the control group. Alveolar bone of abutment teeth was considerably preserved, particularly in seven patients observed 10 years after provision of their dentures. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of this study, the validity of the overdenture treatment in partially edentulous patients is concluded. Good oral hygiene was crucial for the success of treatment with overdentures.\u001b[0m :\n",

Our algorithm improves the generalized bit-flipping algorithm (GBFDA) by considering the multiplicity of the candidates at the check-node output, to perform a more accurate symbol-flipping decision at the variable node update. The MV-SF algorithm greatly improves the frame error rate performance of GBFDA and approaches the performance of the best state-of-the-art decoders [extended min-sum and min-max (Min-Max)] with lower complexity. For a (N=837,K=723) NB-LDPC code over GF(32), the decoder derived from the proposed algorithm can reach a throughput higher than 500 Mb/s and a coding gain of 0.44 dB compared with the most efficient GBFDA architecture with only twice the silicon area.

      " Abstract: The present study is an attempt to identify the morphometric parameters for determining the soil erosion susceptibility (SES) in upper plateau fringe catchment and lower undulating plain catchment of Kangsabati basin using of multi-criteria decision model as compound factor (CF) and hydrological model as revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) under GIS platform. In this research, twenty morphometric parameters of three aspects, namely, linear, areal, and relief were taken from twenty-seven sub-basins to compute the morphometric priority rank using CF model. In contrary, soil erosion factors like rainfall, soil character, slope, and land cover management were taken to measure the potential annual soil erosion using RUSLE. The result showed that fourteen sub-basins in upper catchment (UC) with low compound value represent high morphometric priority rank whereas thirteen sub-basins in lower catchment (LC) with high compound value indicate lower morphometric priority rank. RUSLE estimated that higher rate of mean soil erosion (225 t ha−1 year−1) occurred in UC, whereas low rate of mean soil erosion (74 t ha−1 year−1) occurred in LC. Stepwise least regression of Akaike information criteria (AIC) showed that mean bifurcation ratio (p > 0.013), ruggedness index (p < 0.0001), and form factor (p > 0.034) are the best positive coefficient of erosion susceptibility (ES), but gradient ratio (p > 0.003) and elongation ratio (p > 0.024) have perfect inverse coefficient of high ES in LC. Gradient ratio (p > 0.044) is the only best inverse coefficient parameter of ES in LC due to presence of several conservative practices. Moreover, proper management strategy, effective morphometric, and erosion factors play vital role to determine the ES. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper we propose a procedure for testing linear parametric hypotheses. It is argued that the problem is best described as a decision problem; when it is formulated within the Bayesian decision theoretic framework, such a problem does have natural and coherent solutions. The \"adequacy\" of the hypothesis under test is judged in relation to the consequences its acceptance implies for the solution of a subsequent point estimation problem of the parameters of interest. Therefore, the procedure could be thought of as a two-stage decision procedure, leading to the successive choices of an action (acceptance or rejection of parametric restrictions) and of an answer to an inference problem (point estimation of the parameters of interest) by the systematic application of the criterion of minimizing expected loss. Since specifying the prior probability for hypotheses to be true is a controversial matter, we let such a probability be spread over the whole parameter space. As an illustrative example of the proposed procedure, we applied it to the simple case of one-way ANOVA model. The classical test statistic F of Sneadecor-Fisher is shown as a particular case. Therefore, classical procedures are naturally and constructively derived within this framework.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this study, to investigate the influence of implicit emotion regulation on psychological and electrophysiological responses to gains and losses, participants were required to select between two Chinese four-character idioms to match the meaning of the third one before they performed a monetary gambling task. According to whether their meanings were related to emotion regulation, the idioms fell into two categories. Event-related potentials and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Priming emotion regulation reduced subjective emotional experience to both gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity, while the P3 component was not influenced. According to these results, we suggest that the application of implicit emotion regulation effectively modulated the subjective emotional experience and the motivational salience of current outcomes without the cost of cognitive resources.

      " Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Minimal access aortic valve replacement has become routine in many institutions. Aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes between conventional and minimal access aortic valve replacement. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the data of 2103 patients who underwent primary, isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) in our institution between January 2001 and May 2012 with a minimal access AVR (MAAVR) via the upper partial ministernotomy approach (n = 936) or conventional AVR (CAVR) via the full sternotomy approach (n = 1167). After propensity score matching considering potential confounders [age, sex (female), weight, height, preoperative serum creatinine level, previous myocardial infarction, LV-EF and aortic valve pathology (isolated AS)], 585 matched patients were included in each group. RESULTS: Mean age (65 ± 10.5 vs 65.7 ± 11.5 years, P = 0.23), gender (females 37.2%, P = 0.9), aortic cross-clamp time (65.6 ± 18.4 vs 64.3 ± 19.8 min, P = 0.25) and postoperative blood loss [median (IQR) 400 (224-683) vs 400 (250-610) ml, P = 0.83) were similar in MAAVR and CAVR group. Thirty-day mortality was also not significantly different (1.5 vs 1.7%, P = 0.74, respectively). In contrast, CPB times were significantly longer in MAAVR (93.5 ± 25 vs 88 ± 28 min, P < 0.001). Intraoperative and postoperative autologous blood transfusions were significantly lower in MAAVR (927.2 ± 425.6 vs 1036.4 ± 599.6 ml, P < 0.001 and 170.2 ± 47.6 vs 243.5 ± 89.3 ml, P < 0.001, respectively). Intubation time was significantly shorter in MAAVR [median (IQR) 7 (5-11) vs 8 (6-14) h, P = 0.01). The incidence of renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥1.5 mg/dl) and respiratory insufficiency (need for non-invasive ventilation, reintubation or tracheotomy) was significantly lower in MAAVR (9 vs 16%, P < 0.001 and 8.5 vs 11.8%, P = 0.03, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with CAVR, our study shows that MAAVR is a safe and effective procedure associated with low mortality rate and good long-term survival rates. In addition to that, MAAVR was associated with shorter ventilation times, lower rate of autologous blood transfusion, as well as a lower rate of postoperative respiratory and renal insufficiency. Because of the superior cosmetic results, we therefore advocate MAAVR as the procedure of choice for primary isolated AVR. © The Author 2015.

      " Abstract: This paper set out to examine the role of medicine and medical practice. It has done so by posing a series of questions related to the role of the doctor, health and health care, and the patient-doctor relationship. One of the objectives was to re-examine some of the principles of medical practice, another to consider a vision of medicine for the future. The result of this examination has not turned up anything particularly new or original. What it has done, I believe has been to endorse the principles of medicine which have been established for thousands of years. Yet perhaps in some ways they need to be re-asserted and discussed afresh. Because of the enormous changes in society, in health care and the external and internal pressures on doctors, such values can be forgotten or lost. Change is inevitable and doctors must adapt to meet the changes. They must do so in a positive way and wherever possible take the lead in shaping the health and health care of the future. The values of the future are those of the past, though the setting and context may be quite different. These values include, the importance of caring, the central role of communication, the need to be involved in health as well as illness, the implications of making a diagnosis and the fundamental nature of education and training. There is a need to retain common sense and perspective in making decisions. My vision of the future of medicine is therefore clear.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: During the past decade, the number of earthquakes has increased dramatically in the state of Oklahoma, largely attributed to induced seismicity from wastewater injections (hydraulic fracturing). The increased seismic disaster risk in Oklahoma has captured public attention and necessitated actions by decision makers to mediate the consequences. Geospatial modeling to identify the populations exposed to higher levels of potential risk can help prioritize locations for mitigation actions based on the underlying social vulnerability of residents. In this paper, we explore a method for integrating the spatial distribution of seismic risk (hazard exposure) with social vulnerability (hazard impact). Loss scenarios, social vulnerability metrics, and potential physical damage are combined in a geographic information system to identify the spatial vulnerability of an exposed population to the increased seismic risk, and the locations for targeting mitigation actions — areas with the greatest exposure and vulnerability. The results of induced seismicity earthquake scenarios show disproportionately higher losses for places with more minority populations (primarily African-American) and more renters when compared to the non-induced scenarios, suggesting a potential environmental justice concern. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Reason: The article discusses losses in the context of decision-making, specifically in relation to mitigating seismic risk in Oklahoma. The authors aim to identify areas with the greatest exposure and vulnerability to prioritize locations for mitigation actions, which involves evaluating options and making choices among them. The article focuses on individual-level losses, as it considers the social vulnerability of residents and the potential physical damage to populations exposed to seismic risk.However, the article's primary focus is on the method for integrating seismic risk and social vulnerability, rather than on the decision-making process itself. The decision-making aspect is more implicit, as the authors aim to inform decision-makers about the locations that require mitigation actions.Answer: *yes*, but with some reservations.

      " Abstract: This paper examines the Obama administration’s arguments for ratifying the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities and whether these claims encouraged U.S. senators to approve the agreement. The analysis relies on Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory in which more risk is taken to avoid certain loss and improve conditions when options are framed in terms of losses rather than gains. We argue that the Obama administration was able to persuade Democratic senators to support the JCPOA by arguing the agreement had the potential to curb the development of nuclear weapons by the Iranian regime. But more importantly, the administration was able to frame the status quo as a certain loss, and thus, the risk associated with the JCPOA was acceptable in comparison to not adopting the agreement. Our analysis of the Obama administration’s lobbying efforts and the Democratic senators' statements in support of the agreement demonstrate the value of applying prospect theory to understanding decision making with respect to American foreign policy formulation. © 2019, © 2019 American University, Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Animals are capable of enhanced decision making through cooperation, whereby accurate decisions can occur quickly through decentralized consensus. These interactions often depend upon reliable social cues, which can result in highly coordinated activities in uncertain environments. Yet information within a crowd may be lost in translation, generating confusion and enhancing individual risk. As quantitative data detailing animal social interactions accumulate, the mechanisms enabling individuals to rapidly and accurately process competing social cues remain unresolved. Here, we model how motion-guided attention influences the exchange of visual information during social navigation. We also compare the performance of this mechanism to the hypothesis that robust social coordination requires individuals to numerically limit their attention to a set of n-nearest neighbours. While we find that such numerically limited attention does not generate robust social navigation across ecological contexts, several notable qualities arise from selective attention to motion cues. First, individuals can instantly become a local information hub when startled into action, without requiring changes in neighbour attention level. Second, individuals can circumvent speed-accuracy trade-offs by tuning their motion thresholds. In turn, these properties enable groups to collectively dampen or amplify social information. Lastly, the minority required to sway a group's short-term directional decisions can change substantially with social context. Our findings suggest that motion-guided attention is a fundamental and efficient mechanism underlying collaborative decision making during social navigation. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

      " Abstract: Regulation of lineage biases in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) is pivotal for balanced hematopoietic output. However, little is known about the mechanism behind lineage choice in HSPCs. Here, we show that messenger RNA (mRNA) decay factors regnase-1 (Reg1; Zc3h12a) and regnase-3 (Reg3; Zc3h12c) are essential for determining lymphoid fate and restricting myeloid differentiation in HSPCs. Loss of Reg1 and Reg3 resulted in severe impairment of lymphopoiesis and a mild increase in myelopoiesis in the bone marrow. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Reg1 and Reg3 regulate lineage directions in HSPCs via the control of a set of myeloid-related genes. Reg1- and Reg3-mediated control of mRNA encoding Nfkbiz, a transcriptional and epigenetic regulator, was essential for balancing lymphoid/myeloid lineage output in HSPCs in vivo. Furthermore, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing analysis revealed that Reg1 and Reg3 control the epigenetic landscape on myeloid-related gene loci in early stage HSPCs via Nfkbiz. Consistently, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit Reg1- and Reg3-mediated Nfkbiz mRNA degradation primed hematopoietic stem cells toward myeloid lineages by enhancing Nfkbiz expression. Collectively, the collaboration between posttranscriptional control and chromatin remodeling by the Reg1/Reg3-Nfkbiz axis governs HSPC lineage biases, ultimately dictating the fate of lymphoid vs myeloid differentiation. © 2024 American Society of Hematology\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background and objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the national burden of cerebrovascular diseases in the adult population of Spain. Patients and methods: Cross-sectional, descriptive population-based study. We calculated the disabilityadjusted life years (DALY) metric using country-specific data from national statistics and epidemiological studies to obtain representative outcomes for the Spanish population. DALYs were divided into years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years of life lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were estimated for the year 2008 by applying demographic structure by sex and agegroups, cause-specific mortality, morbidity data and new disability weights proposed in the recent Global Burden of Disease study. In the base case, neither YLLs nor YLDs were discounted or age-weighted. Uncertainty around DALYs was tested using sensitivity analyses. Results: In Spain, cerebrovascular diseases generated 418,052 DALYs, comprising 337,000 (80.6%) YLLs and 81,052 (19.4%) YLDs. This accounts for 1,113 DALYs per 100,000 population (men: 1,197 and women: 1,033) and 3,912 per 100,000 in those over the age of 65 years (men: 4,427 and women: 2,033). Depending on the standard life table and choice of social values used for calculation, total DALYs varied by 15.3% and 59.9% below the main estimate.

A successive over-relaxation (SOR) scheme for the equivalent finite difference equation gives rapid convergence to the static solution. It is known that a suitable choice of scattering parameters in a transmission line matrix (TLM) network analogue of the Laplace equation yields ultra-fast convergence. The results of numerical experiments which are reported here suggests that a similar situation also applies to the solution of the Poisson equation with shunt losses (the BCF equation), although the choice of optimum conditions appears to be different for different spatial positions within the solution space.

      " Abstract: Aims and objectives: The purpose of this research was to critically examine the factors that contribute to turnover of experienced nurses' including their decision to leave practice settings and seek alternate nursing employment. In this study, we explore experienced nurses' decision-making processes and examine the personal and environmental factors that influenced their decision to leave. Background: Nursing turnover remains a pressing problem for healthcare delivery. Turnover contributes to increased recruitment and orientation cost, reduced quality patient care and the loss of mentorship for new nurses. Design: A qualitative, interpretive descriptive approach was used to guide the study. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 12 registered nurses, averaging 16 years in practice. Participants were equally represented from an array of acute care inpatient settings. The sample drew on perspectives from point-of-care nurses and nurses in leadership roles, primarily charge nurses and clinical nurse educators. Results: Nurses' decisions to leave practice were influenced by several interrelated work environment and personal factors: higher patient acuity, increased workload demands, ineffective working relationships among nurses and with physicians, gaps in leadership support and negative impacts on nurses' health and well-being. Ineffective working relationships with other nurses and lack of leadership support led nurses to feel dissatisfied and ill equipped to perform their job. The impact of high stress was evident on the health and emotional well-being of nurses. Conclusions: It is vital that healthcare organisations learn to minimise turnover and retain the wealth of experienced nurses in acute care settings to maintain quality patient care and contain costs. Relevance to clinical practice: This study highlights the need for healthcare leaders to re-examine how they promote collaborative practice, enhance supportive leadership behaviours, and reduce nurses' workplace stressors to retain the skills and knowledge of experienced nurses at the point-of-care. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Based on the multi-layer network perspective, a method for constructing the double-layer urban rail transit topology network was proposed. Then, the choice behavior of passengers at congested stations was analyzed, and the passenger flow loss rate was quantified. Moreover, a congestion propagation model for the double-layer urban rail transit network was proposed, and the congestion propagation process was analyzed using a real network as an illustration. The results indicate that once the congestion disturbance reaches an influence threshold, the congestion would propagate to other stations in the same or different layers, ultimately spreading widely in the network. The preferences and risk attitudes of passengers at congested stations affect the passenger flow loss rate. Furthermore, the spontaneous travel choice behavior of passengers at congested stations can regulate the congestion propagation process of urban rail transit networks. The stations with high topological importance are more capable of propagating congestion than stations with high functional importance, and the passenger flow distribution structure of the network is more fragile than the network topological structure. The increase in coupling coefficient leads to a rise in station-to-station interaction, making congestion more likely to propagate. The research results can provide a reference for urban rail transit passenger flow operation organization. © (2023), (International Association of Engineers). All Rights Reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Inherent safety is a proactive approach for loss or elimination of hazard values and risk management. Expansion of safety relating to process and production in a supply chain in an uncertain environment has a critical effect on the competitive advantage of each food industrial organization. In this article, the fuzzy rating weights of each pair of the considered hazards and uncertain hazard values are described by linguistic expressions modelled by triangular fuzzy numbers. The fuzzy extent approach for the synthetic extent values of the pairwise comparison for handling fuzzy analytic hierarchical process is used to calculate the weight vector. The proposed fuzzy model is arranged in a hierarchical structure, so that the output of one interference system is used as an input for the second interference step. In the first of interference steps, the total hazard value for each identified process is calculated using the fuzzy algebra rules. In the second interference step, the inherent safety index for each process is determined on the basis of total hazard value, using the IF-THEN fuzzy logic rules. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy model is highly suitable as a decision making tool for making decisions about the inherent safety index of food industrial processes. © IMechE 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.\u001b[0m :\n",

SETTING: A tertiary-care general teaching hospital serving the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, with a referral population of over 1 million. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14,374 adult patients admitted between January 2001-November 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Paraprotein on serum and/or urine protein electrophoresis (SPE/UPE). RESULTS: Five points were assigned for globulin >41 g/l, 3 points for age ≥60, 2 points for each of hemoglobin <121 and male gender, and 1 point for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60.

Bezold's abscess with concomitant intracranial complications of mastoiditis is even rarer. We reported a 19-year-old man with retroauricular pain and bilateral ear discharge for 10 years. Mastoid high-resolution CT (HRCT) showed opacification in middle-ear cavity and destruction of both right mastoid and occipital bone. Contrast-enhanced neck CT showed deep neck abscess, extending to thoracic region. Contrast-enhanced cerebral CT showed right sigmoid sinus thrombosis, fluid collection in infratentorial subdural space, pneumocephalus, and hydrocephalus.

Availability of all components composing the subsets is required for performing the primary mission (PM) and the rescue procedure (RP) respectively. The system is exposed to random shocks during its operation. The components’ resistance to shocks deteriorates with the number of experienced shocks. Failure of any component from the PM subset results in the mission failure. To enhance the system's survivability, the PM can be aborted upon occurrence of the nth shock without waiting for the PM failure. In the case of PM failure or abortion, the RP is activated. If, at least one component from the RP subset does not survive all shocks occurring until completion of the RP, the system is lost. The choice of n should balance the mission success probability and the system survival probability.

It becomes a trend to research on spatial information analysis and publishing based on GIS. Compared with the expensive and system-huge commercial software, open source platform which is free and small-scale is becoming a new choice. This article develops the marine oil spill monitoring information analysis & publishing system based on DotSpatial, the upgrade version of the open-source.NET development of component library. In this system, the monitoring information of oil spill is visualized, rendered, analyzed and finally published on the web. However open source GIS is functionally limited and instable. DotSpatial can not read the spatial information of RS images well and the mapping module is unstable. This article solves some technical problems. For example, the spatial data is processed such as re-projected via GDAL to match the images layers with the vector layers. Vector oil spots data is generated and rendered, and the major axis and minor axis are drawn. Moreover the map extent to output can be determined by dragging a rectangle using GDI+, and the decorating of the map to putout is also improved.

      " Abstract: The ethics for psychiatric surgery should be defined as constituting the same ethics that are carried out in all surgical operations and in fact all methods of caring for the sick. If psychosurgery, even by selective 'blunting', lessens the intolerable symptoms causing a person to be antisocial or to commit suicide then it is ethically proper, while if the operation makes this person less happy and less adjusted to social living then it is unethical. The decision as to whether psychosurgery is desirable can only be decided by the psychiatrist, the surgeon and the patient or his family, not by legislators, politicians or psychologists. They can determine only the legal penalties and the psychic loss (their province) in all forms of surgical and medical care of the sick, be it for cancer, for trauma or for mental illness.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Human behavior is more strongly driven by the motivation to avoid losses than to pursue gains (loss aversion). However, there is little research on how losses influence the motivation to exert effort. We compared the effects of loss and gain incentives on cognitive task performance and effort-based decision making. In three experiments, participants performed a cognitively effortful task under gain and loss conditions and made choices about effort expenditure in a decision-making task. Results consistently showed significant loss aversion in effort-based decision making. Participants were willing to invest more effort in the loss compared to the gain condition (i.e., perform a longer duration task: Experiments 1 and 2; or higher task load: Experiment 3). On the other hand, losses did not lead to improved performance (sustained attention), or higher physiological effort (pupil diameter) in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, losses did enhance working memory performance, but only at the highest load level. Taken together, these results suggest that loss aversion motivates higher effort investment in effort-based decision-making, while the effect of loss aversion during a performance may depend on the task type or effort level. © Copyright © 2020 Massar, Pu, Chen and Chee.\u001b[0m :\n",

The erosion process is spatially characterized on the west coast of New Caledonia to assess potential sediment inputs in the marine area. This paper describes the methodologies that are used to map soil sensitivity to erosion using remote sensing and a geographic information system tool. A cognitive approach, multi-criteria evaluation model and Universal Soil Loss Equation are implemented. This article compares the relevance of each model in order to spatialize and quantify potential erosion at catchment basin scale.

      " Abstract: Heterogeneity in response to treatment is a pervasive problem in medicine. Many researchers have proposed individualized treatment rule methods for this problem, which personalize treatment recommendations based on an individual's recorded covariates. A challenge with using these methods in practice is that they determine a treatment rule, rather than quantify treatment benefit. This can be problematic, as a recommended treatment could be burdensome and have negligible improvements in outcome for some individuals. With the aim of helping practitioners make informed modelling choices, we identify two families of loss functions to use with individualized treatment rule methods. Under the assumption of correct model specification, estimation with a loss function from one family ensures that the model's treatment recommendations can be interpreted in terms of the risk difference, while the other family of loss functions ensures that the model's treatment recommendations can be interpreted in terms of the risk ratio. We also derive two upper bounds for a model's error in risk difference and risk ratio estimation. Each upper bound can be calculated using observed data and can provide insight to practitioners regarding model error in estimating treatment effects. We illustrate our contributions with simulation studies as well as with data from the ACTG-175 AIDS study. © 2024 The Authors. Stat published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background The CEGS N-GRID 2016 Shared Task in Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP) provided a set of 1000 neuropsychiatric notes to participants as part of a competition to predict psychiatric symptom severity scores. This paper summarizes our methods, results, and experiences based on our participation in the second track of the shared task. Objective Classical methods of text classification usually fall into one of three problem types: binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification. In this effort, we study ordinal regression problems with text data where misclassifications are penalized differently based on how far apart the ground truth and model predictions are on the ordinal scale. Specifically, we present our entries (methods and results) in the N-GRID shared task in predicting research domain criteria (RDoC) positive valence ordinal symptom severity scores (absent, mild, moderate, and severe) from psychiatric notes. Methods We propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed to handle ordinal regression tasks on psychiatric notes. Broadly speaking, our model combines an ordinal loss function, a CNN, and conventional feature engineering (wide features) into a single model which is learned end-to-end. Given interpretability is an important concern with nonlinear models, we apply a recent approach called locally interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) to identify important words that lead to instance specific predictions. Results Our best model entered into the shared task placed third among 24 teams and scored a macro mean absolute error (MMAE) based normalized score (100·(1-MMAE)) of 83.86. Since the competition, we improved our score (using basic ensembling) to 85.55, comparable with the winning shared task entry. Applying LIME to model predictions, we demonstrate the feasibility of instance specific prediction interpretation by identifying words that led to a particular decision. Conclusion In this paper, we present a method that successfully uses wide features and an ordinal loss function applied to convolutional neural networks for ordinal text classification specifically in predicting psychiatric symptom severity scores. Our approach leads to excellent performance on the N-GRID shared task and is also amenable to interpretability using existing model-agnostic approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In Kőszegi and Rabin’s (Q J Econ 1133–1165, 2006, Am Econ Rev 97:1047–1073, 2007) reference-dependent model of preferences, the chance of obtaining a better outcome can reduce an agent’s expected utility through an increase in the stochastic reference point. This means that individuals may prefer stochastically dominated lotteries. In this sense, hope, understood as a small probability of a better outcome, can be a curse. While Kőszegi and Rabin focus on a linear specification of the utility function, we show that this effect occurs more broadly. Using fairly plausible assumptions and parameter values, we specify the conditions under which it occurs, as well as the type of lotteries in which this should be expected. We then show that while a simple subjective transformation of probability into weights of the reference point may in some cases mitigate the issue, in others, it can intensify it or even generate new ones. Finally, we extend the model by adding the individual’s current reference point (status quo) to the stochastic reference point. We show that this modification can reconcile Kőszegi and Rabin’s model with the apparent empirical infrequency of stochastically dominated choices while maintaining its main qualitative results. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

Inspired by Nelson and Kinney (1997), we conducted an experiment where auditors and investors evaluate management’s loss disclosures. We manipulate the probability of loss at three levels and the uncertainty about the ambiguity at two levels. Our results show that both auditors and investors appear to be aggressive toward financial reporting choices, and are less willing to recommend a loss contingency disclosure when there is ambiguity. Our results extend prior accounting literature and highlight the importance of understanding imprecise estimates in financial reporting. We found that auditors and investors reacted very similarly toward ambiguity in loss disclosures. This result may reflect a narrowing of the expectations gap around reporting accounting estimates and highlight the potential improvements in users’ confidence in accountants. © 2020, American Accounting Association.

      " Abstract: Urban environments are novel ecosystems, with increased chemical, sound, and light pollution differentially impacting many animals. Understanding the impacts of urban environments on biodiversity is the first step to understanding how to best mitigate biodiversity losses in an increasingly urbanizing world. Analyses with broad geographic and taxonomic coverage can offer critical context for informing urban biodiversity conservation. But such studies are currently lacking, especially for under-studied, but likely highly impacted, taxa such as frogs. Our objective was to document frog diversity in relation to urban environments at continental, regional, and local scales. We used FrogID data, ⁠an opportunistic citizen science dataset generated by volunteers recording calling frogs using a smartphone and validated by experts ⁠throughout continental Australia, to calculate species richness, Shannon diversity, and phylogenetic diversity of frogs in urban and non-urban areas, as well as along a continuous urbanization gradient. The overall species richness of frogs was, on average, 57% less in urban than non-urban areas across six ecoregions. Further, we found significantly lower frog diversity in urban environments compared with non-urban environments across the country, with an average reduction of 59% species richness, 86% Shannon diversity, and 72% phylogenetic diversity. We also found evidence for a steady decrease in frog diversity along an urbanization gradient, with no obvious thresholds. Our results highlight the negative impacts of urbanization, ⁠at a continental scale, ⁠on frog diversity, and clearly highlight the necessity to consider frog diversity in future urban land development decisions. © 2021 Gesellschaft für Ökologie\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper focuses on the potential role of policy in influencing the poverty and land degradation problems facing Africa. This is done through exploring a few case studies, chosen from a broad spectrum of African countries - Sudan, Malawi, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. The first case study examines the comparative returns to the gum arabic agroforestry system cultivated by poor farmers in Northern Sudan, and the role of policies in influencing these returns. The second explores how erratic agricultural pricing policies in Malawi during the 1980s may have distorted the incentives of poor smallholders to adopt less-erosive crops in their farming systems. The third case study illustrates how inappropriate policies and investments can cause displacement of poorer rural groups from their traditional farming and grazing lands, by examining the loss of a major floodplain due to dam building in northern Nigeria. The final two case studies are concerned with policy 'lessons learned'. The first looks at the impact of a macro-economic adjustment policy - in this case trade liberalization - on farmers' decisions to expand cultivated area rather than intensify crop production in western Ghana. The final case study examines the role of policy in land management success story in Africa, the Machakos District, Kenya, and explores the critical question of whether this success can be replicated elsewhere in Africa. These case studies serve two important functions. First, they demonstrate how policy analysis can be effective in highlighting key dimensions of the poverty-environment linkages underlying land degradation. Second, they illustrate how both 'good' and 'bad' policies can affect the economic incentives determining poor rural household's decisions to conserve or degrade their land.

      " Abstract: Background: Taxol (generic name paclitaxel), a plant-derived antineoplastic agent, used widely against breast, ovarian and lung cancer, was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew, Taxus brevifolia. The limited supply of the drug has prompted efforts to find alternative sources, such as chemical synthesis, tissue and cell cultures of the Taxus species both of which are expensive and yield low levels. Fermentation processes with microorganisms would be the methods of choice to lower the costs and increase yields. Previously we have reported that F. solani isolated from T. celebica produced taxol and its precursor baccatin III in liquid grown cultures J Biosci 33:259-67, 2008. This study was performed to evaluate the inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis of cancer cell lines by the fungal taxol and fungal baccatin III of F. solani isolated from T. celebica.Methods: Cell lines such as HeLa, HepG2, Jurkat, Ovcar3 and T47D were cultured individually and treated with fungal taxol, baccatin III with or without caspase inhibitors according to experimental requirements. Their efficacy on apoptotic induction was examined.Results: Both fungal taxol and baccatin III inhibited cell proliferation of a number of cancer cell lines with IC50 ranging from 0.005 to 0.2 μM for fungal taxol and 2 to 5 μM for fungal baccatin III. They also induced apoptosis in JR4-Jurkat cells with a possible involvement of anti-apoptotic Bcl2 and loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, and was unaffected by inhibitors of caspase-9,-2 or -3 but was prevented in presence of caspase-10 inhibitor. DNA fragmentation was also observed in cells treated with fungal taxol and baccatin III.Conclusions: The cytotoxic activity exhibited by fungal taxol and baccatin III involves the same mechanism, dependent on caspase-10 and membrane potential loss of mitochondria, with taxol having far greater cytotoxic potential. © 2013 Chakravarthi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Abstract: The annual average rainfall in the coastal area of Bangladesh is more than 2,400 mm and rainwater harvesting (RWH) has been practiced for a long time for drinking water supply. For household RWH, the capacity of the storage tanks varies from 1,000 to 5,000 litres, which are the model-type storage tanks provided under several RWH programs of government and NGOs. The optimum storage tank volume has not been investigated considering family size and demand, roof types and rainfall. As a result, most of the households can avail water from rainwater tanks for about six months and rest of the year, they have to depend on other unreliable and distance sources. With the aim of developing a comprehensive decision support tool for a reliable RWH system, design curves for the storage volume were developed for three climatic conditions (i.e. dry, average, and wet years), available roof catchment area (10–50 m2), rainfall loss factor and household demand (2–12 lpcd) for a typical six members family using mass curve. Moreover, a spreadsheet-based daily water balance model was developed to assess the reliability of the currently used water tanks (1,000–5,000 L). The analysis showed that the currently used tanks are insufficient to meet the year-long drinking and cooking water demand. Under average and dry climatic conditions, the achievable reliability does not significantly varies with increase of catchment area and tank size; and the maximum achievable reliability is about 70%. A large quantity of water is lost as spilled water even with a tank size of 5,000 L. This water can be used for other purposes if larger tanks are used to capture the excessive spilled water. © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Follow-up shows five of these patients as 100 per cent relieved, one as 75 per cent relieved. Three were entirely well a few months after operation but have not been heard from since. One died of peritonitis on the 16th postoperative day. In four cases in which lumbar sympathectomy was done, the result was partial, temporary or no improvement. Of the patients not operated upon, several have been lost to follow-up, some are doing well on medical treatment, one died in early infancy, and resection is being considered for two. For children with congenital megacolon the authors recommend first a thorough trial of medical treatment consisting of diet, vitamins, drugs and enemas. This should be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made, in an attempt to prevent the distention and hypertrophy of the bowel from progressing. If distention remains after a reasonable trial period and the child is not gaining weight adequately, requires repeated hospitalization, and is three years of age or more, then resection of the affected portion of the colon is indicated. The risk of operation has been somewhat reduced with better supportive measures and chemotherapy now available. Since infants and extremely young children do not stand operation on the colon as well as older children, decision to operate should take into consideration the age of the patient.

When we work in environments of tribal warfare and clans carrying out subversive activities, we will choose to leave our souls at home to protect them from the toxicity of the work environment. For anyone who has been cared for by nurses who have left their soul at home, you have experienced the outcome of negative environments that cannot have effective conversations. Recently a nurse told about her experience of realizing one day that she had the right to be happy at work so that she could more effectively take care of her 5-year-old daughter when she returned home. When she saw this as a right, she made a decision to leave her organization and look for a place that valued conversations and harmony rather than aggression and lack of trust. The only way to improve the world is through relationships, and conversations are the prelude to creating that change. Having the courage to reach out and start the dialogue knowing full well that it might be very messy is the only way to end the fragmentation and loss of community we experience in our organizations. Wheatley (2002) describes the experience of \"...sacred as a feeling that I belong here\" (p. 133). In the process of conversations, we can explore and appreciate our differences but also feel more connected and one with each other as a result of having the courage to converse.

      " Abstract: Although biodiversity is generally diminishing, in some areas its conservation is expanding. However; the exact path of this expansion is uncertain. This can lead to problems of path-dependence and lock-in effects. Path dependence describes situations where history strongly influences present decisions and lock-in effects refer to situations where an earlier decision provides strong incentives to follow a particular path, even if more efficient alternatives are available later on. We develop a conceptual ecological-economic model to investigate which ecological and economic parameters favour the appearance of efficiency losses in biodiversity conservation due to path dependence and lock-in effects in a dynamic two-period two-region model. Generally we find that efficiency losses occur if there are signals that guide the first-period budget into a region that later turns out to be suboptimal if both time periods had been considered right from the beginning. To illustrate the conservation relevance of our findings, we present potential efficiency losses through path dependence in the hypothetical case of applying offsets to conserving the endangered Maculinea teleius butterfly near the city of Landau in Germany. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Reducing the redundancy of spectral information is an important technique in classification of hyperspectral image. The existing methods are classified into two categories: feature extraction and band selection. Compared with the feature extraction, the band selection method preserves most of the characteristics of the original data without losing valuable details. However, the choice of the effective band remains challenging, especially when considering the computational burden, which makes many enumerative methods infeasible. Recently, immune clonal strategy (ICS) has been applied to solve complex computation problems. The major advantages of algorithms based on ICS are that they are highly paralleled, distributed, adaptive, and self-organizing. Therefore, in this paper, we convert the band selection problem into an optimization issue and propose a new algorithm, ICS-based effective band selection (ICS-EBS), to select effective band combinations. Then, the selected bands are used in classification of hyperspectral image. We evaluated the proposed algorithm by using two data sets collected from the Washington DC Mall and Northwest Tippecanoe County. ICS-EBS was compared against one latest proposed band selection algorithm, interclass separability index Algorithm (ICSIA). We also compared the results with those achieved by other stochastic algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and ant colony optimization (ACO). The experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm outperforms ICSIA, GA-EBS, and ACO-EBS for hyperspectral image classification. © 2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Rationale: The ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptor is composed of NR1 and NR2 (NR2A-D) subunits. While there is compelling evidence that NMDA receptors modulate behavioral effects of ethanol, there is little understanding of how the subunit composition of the NMDA receptor mediates these effects. Objectives: In the current study, we assessed the relative roles of NMDA subunits via phenotypic assessment of ethanol-related behaviors in NR2A knockout (KO) mice. Results: Results demonstrated that NR2A KO and heterozygous mice failed to show evidence of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference. As compared to wild-type (WT) controls, KO mice showed impaired motor coordination at baseline and, in some instances, following ethanol treatment on the accelerating rotarod, balance beam, and wire-hang tests. By contrast, open field locomotor-stimulant, sedative/hypnotic, and hypothermic responses to ethanol were not different between genotypes, nor was voluntary ethanol consumption and preference in a two-bottle choice paradigm. Blood ethanol concentrations were lower in KO than WT mice following intraperitoneal ethanol injection. Conclusions: Results suggest that the loss of NR2A subunit-containing NMDA receptors impairs the ability to form or express learned reward-related responses to ethanol and causes deficits in motor coordination. However, the loss of NR2A does not alter other measures of acute ethanol intoxication or ethanol consumption, possibly implicating other NMDA subunits in these effects. These data provide novel insight into the role of NMDA receptors in modulating the behavioral effects of ethanol. © Springer-Verlag 2006.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Wood degradation caused by fungi, termites, and insects, is a major problem for the rubberwood industry. The potential of wood vinegar as rubberwood preservative was studied. The infestation rates of Coptotermes gestroi (Wasmann) (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) on rubberwood samples treated with 25%, 50% and 100% eucalyptus wood vinegar for 24 hours were observed in laboratory conditions. Both non-choice and choice experiments were included. The effects of eucalyptus wood vinegar treatment depended on its concentration. In the non-choice experiments, rubberwood samples treated with 100% eucalyptus wood vinegar had the highest resistance to C. gestroi infestation, with the lowest relative loss of mass, followed in rank order by 50% and 25% treatments. However, in the choice experiments the relative loss of mass did not differ significantly between the treatments with varied wood vinegar concentration. Untreated control samples were distinctly infested by C. gestroi in both non-choice and choice experiments, but their relative loss of mass in the non-choice experiments was not significantly different from samples treated with 25% eucalyptus wood vinegar. Hence, 25% eucalyptus wood vinegar was not effective as rubberwood preservative against C. gestroi attack. The results suggest that eucalyptus wood vinegar acts as a rubberwood preservative against termites, provided the treatment is done without dilution. About 50% dilution still has some efficacy, while lower concentrations are not effective.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Large-scale flood risk assessments are crucial for decision making, especially with respect to new flood defense schemes, adaptation planning and estimating insurance premiums. We apply the process-based Regional Flood Model (RFM) to simulate a 5000-year flood event catalog for all major catchments in Germany and derive risk curves based on the losses per economic sector. The RFM uses a continuous process simulation including a multisite, multivariate weather generator, a hydrological model considering heterogeneous catchment processes, a coupled 1D–2D hydrodynamic model considering dike overtopping and hinterland storage, spatially explicit sector-wise exposure data and empirical multi-variable loss models calibrated for Germany. For all components, uncertainties in the data and models are estimated. We estimate the median Expected Annual Damage (EAD) and Value at Risk at 99.5% confidence for Germany to be €0.529 bn and €8.865 bn, respectively. The commercial sector dominates by making about 60% of the total risk, followed by the residential sector. The agriculture sector gets affected by small return period floods and only contributes to less than 3% to the total risk. The overall EAD is comparable to other large-scale estimates. However, the estimation of losses for specific return periods is substantially improved. The spatial consistency of the risk estimates avoids the large overestimation of losses for rare events that is common in other large-scale assessments with homogeneous return periods. Thus, the process-based, spatially consistent flood risk assessment by RFM is an important step forward and will serve as a benchmark for future German-wide flood risk assessments. © 2021 The Authors.

      " Abstract: Many individual attributes considered for personnel selection such as organizing ability, creativity, personality, and leadership exhibit vagueness and imprecision. The fuzzy set theory appears as an essential tool to provide a decision framework that incorporates imprecise judgments inherent in the personnel selection process. In this paper, a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) algorithm using the principles of fusion of fuzzy information, 2-tuple linguistic representation model, and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) is developed. The proposed method is apt to manage information assessed using both linguistic and numerical scales in a decision making problem with multiple information sources. Furthermore, it enables managers to deal with heterogeneous information. The decision making framework presented in this paper employs ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator that encompasses several operators as the aggregation operator since it can implement different aggregation rules by changing the order weights. The aggregation process is based on the unification of information by means of fuzzy sets on a basic linguistic term set (BLTS). Then, the unified information is transformed into linguistic 2-tuples in a way to rectify the problem of loss information of other fuzzy linguistic approaches. The computational procedure of the proposed framework is illustrated through a personnel selection problem reported in an earlier study. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Insufficient sleep is pervasive worldwide, and its toll on health and safety is recapitulated in many settings. It is thus important to understand how poor sleep affects the brain and decision making. A robust literature documents the adverse effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive processes including cognitive flexibility, which is the capacity to appraise new feedback and make behavioral adjustments to respond appropriately. Animal models are often used to unravel the molecules, genes and neural circuits that are altered by sleep loss. Herein we take a translational approach to model the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive rigidity, i.e., impaired cognitive flexibility in rats. Methods: There are several approaches to assess cognitive rigidity; in the present study, we employ a pairwise discrimination reversal task. To our knowledge this is the first time this paradigm has been used to investigate sleep deprivation. In this touchscreen operant platform, we trained rats to select one of two images to claim a sucrose pellet reward. If the non-rewarded image was selected the rats proceeded to a correction trial where both images were presented in the same position as before. This image presentation continued until the rat selected the correct image. Once rats reached performance criteria, the reward contingencies were reversed. In one group of rats the initial reversal session was preceded by 10 h of sleep deprivation. We compared those rats to controls with undisturbed sleep on the number of sessions to reach performance criteria, number of trials per session, response latencies, correct responses, errors, perseverative errors and perseveration bouts in the initial training and reversal phases. Results: We report that on reversal session one, sleep deprived rats completed a fraction of the trials completed by controls. On subsequent reversal sessions, the sleep deprived rats struggled to adapt to the reversed contingencies despite completing a similar number of trials, suggesting an effect of cognitive rigidity separate from fatigue. Discussion: We discuss the delayed performance dynamics incurred by sleep loss in the context of fatigue and the implications of using pairwise discrimination reversal as a model to further examine the effects of sleep loss on adaptive decision making.

      " Abstract: We developed a two-period duopoly model to show how consumers' variety-seeking behavior affects the pricing and service level decisions of a traditional product and a sharing product. Our analysis revealed that, without considering the consumers' variety-seeking behavior, the traditional product attracted consumers with a high level of service and high price, while the sharing product attracted consumers with a low level of service and low price. When we only considered variety-seeking behavior and did not adjust the service level, the product with the low level of service benefited from the consumers' variety-seeking behavior, while the product with the high level of service lost profits. When we considered the variety-seeking behavior and adjusted the service level as well as the price, the sharing product was attractive to variety-seeking consumers and it gained a greater competitive advantage over the traditional product. For two periods, the number of variety-seeking consumers who switched from buying traditional products to buying sharing products was greater than those who switched from buying sharing products to buying traditional products. Furthermore, we found that when the consumers' variety-seeking behavior was not obvious, the number of consumers shifting from the traditional product increased monotonically. In contrast, when the variety-seeking behavior was obvious, the number of consumers shifting from the traditional product decreased monotonically. © 2019 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a very complex and devastating disorder of the brain that affects over 2 million people in the United States, mostly over age 65. Approximately one-half are taken care of at home by family members; the remainder are in institutions. Nearly 120,000 deaths are attributed to AD annually. While biomedical research continues to make headway in uncovering factors related to the disease, the causes, and therefore, the treatment remain just beyond our reach. In the meantime, persons with AD, their family members, and professional caregivers must learn to cope with this disabling disease on a day-to-day basis while waiting for a breakthrough. AD is characterized by a gradual decline in mental status and functional abilities over an extended period of time, from as short as 1 year to as long as 10 years or more. Eventually, all components of cerebral functioning are altered, with the neuronal losses exhibited at the cognitive and behavioral level. The nature and degree of decline depends on the extent of the progression of neuronal deterioration and, therefore, varies widely from patient to patient. The complex interactional patterns of pathophysiological brain changes and the concommitant cognitive/behavioral manifestations present careplanning and caregiving dilemmas. On the one hand, it is our responsibility as nurses to treat patients and teach others to care for patients in the least restrictive environment possible, while maintaining a choice of options, promoting optimal functioning, and fostering independence in the patient. On the other hand, these goals represent a delicate balance in the face of a progressively deteriorating neuronal structure that robs the person of the ability to reason and solves problems. It is unrealistic to expect a person to perform tasks for which he/she is neither cognitively nor functionally equipped to handle. Maintaining this delicate balance requires that the nurse continually make informed clinical judgments based on accurate assessments and a thorough knowledge of the physiological changes caused by the disease process. The Progressively Lowered Stress Threshold Model (Hall 1988) holds great promise for further research and the development of clinical interventions with AD sufferers. The caregiving goal is to compensate for the losses and help the patient function within his/her neurologic capacity. © 1990, W.B. Saunders Company. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Phase change materials (PCMs), like polyethylene glycol (PEG), have been widely applied to the storage and utilization of low-grade thermal energy, which is a momentous part of energy utilization and conversion. Furthermore, one of the important ways to solve the practical problems of easy leakage and slow speed of heat storage of PCMs is to prepare the phase change composites (PCCs) featured with stable shape, high enthalpy retention and improved thermal conductivity. For this purpose, we focused on the waste bio-based pomelo peel, which was converted into biochar as the supporting material of PEG through a simple carbonization process, then vacuum impregnated with four different molecular weights of PEG to obtain the PCCs characterized by no leakage, high loading and enhanced thermal diffusion ability. The DSC results revealed that the melting enthalpy of several PCCs were about 160 J/g, which were slightly lower than that of pure PEG, but the relative enthalpy efficiency still exceeded 90%. Meanwhile, PCCs had excellent thermal stability and cycling stability, and the mass loss in 200 heat-cooling cycles was only 2.69% at most, which is beneficial to the preservation of enthalpy. The tests of solar-thermal conversion and storage manifested that PCCs could make full use of the solar radiation heat energy, with the efficiency of about 75%∼x223C 80%. With the low-cost and waste-recycling, this work provides a new choice for further efficient and comprehensive utilization of low-grade thermal energy including solar radiation heat energy. © 2021\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Protein aggregation is a biological process that occurs when proteins misfold. Misfolding and aggregation of human superoxide dismutase (hSOD1) cause a neurodegenerative disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Among the mutations occurring, targeting the E21K mutation could be a good choice to understand the pathological mechanism of SOD1 in ALS, whereof it significantly reduces life hopefulness in patients. Naturally occurring polyphenolic flavonoids have been suggested as a way to alleviate the amyloidogenic behavior of proteins. In this study, computational tools were used to identify promising flavonoid compounds that effectively inhibit the pathogenic behavior of the E21K mutant. Initial screening identified Pelargonidin, Curcumin, and Silybin as promising leads. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that the binding of flavonoids to the mutated SOD1 caused changes in the protein stability, hydrophobicity, flexibility, and restoration of lost hydrogen bonds. Secondary structure analysis indicated that the protein destabilization and the increased propensity of β-sheet caused by the mutation were restored to the wild-type state upon binding of flavonoids. Free energy landscape (FEL) analysis was also used to differentiate aggregation, and results showed that Silybin followed by Pelargonidin had the most therapeutic efficacy against the E21K mutant SOD1. Therefore, these flavonoids hold great potential as highly effective inhibitors in mitigating ALS's fatal and insuperable effects. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

      " Abstract: Semi-supervised learning, which entails training a model with manually labeled images and pseudo-labels for unlabeled images, has garnered considerable attention for its potential to improve image classification performance. Nevertheless, incorrect decision boundaries of classifiers and wrong pseudo-labels for beneficial unlabeled images below the confidence threshold increase the generalization error in semi-supervised learning. This study proposes a novel framework for semi-supervised learning termed consistency-regularized bad generative adversarial network (CRBSGAN) through a new loss function. The proposed model comprises a discriminator, a bad generator, and a classifier that employs data augmentation and consistency regularization. Local augmentation is created to compensate for data scarcity and boost bad generators. Moreover, label consistency regularization is considered for bad fake images, real labeled images, unlabeled images, and latent space for the discriminator and bad generator. In the adversarial game between the discriminator and the bad generator, feature space is better captured under these conditions. Furthermore, local consistency regularization for good-augmented images applied to the classifier strengthens the bad generator in the generator–classifier adversarial game. The consistency-regularized bad generator produces informative fake images similar to the support vectors located near the correct classification boundary. In addition, the pseudo-label error is reduced for low-confidence unlabeled images used in training. The proposed method reduces the state-of-the-art error rate from 6.44 to 4.02 on CIFAR-10, 2.06 to 1.56 on MNIST, and 6.07 to 3.26 on SVHN using 4000, 3000, and 500 labeled training images, respectively.

The results show that mechanically robust and flexible Li-ion batteries (Li4Ti5O12//LiFePO4) based on the use of a nonwoven multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) mat as a current collector (CC) exhibited a 14-fold decrease in voltage fluctuation at a bending strain of 4.2%, as compared to cells using traditional metal foil CCs. More importantly, MWNT-based full-cells exhibited excellent mechanical integrity through 288 crease cycles, whereas the foil full-cell exhibited continuously degraded performance with each fold and catastrophic fracture after only 94 folds. The enhancements due to MWNT CCs can be attributed to excellent interfacial properties as well as high mechanical strength coupled with compliancy, which allow the batteries to easily conform during mechanical abuse. These results quantitatively demonstrate the substantial enhancement offered in both mechanical and electrochemical stability which can be realized with traditional processing approaches when an appropriate choice of a flexible and robust CC is utilized. © 2016 American Chemical Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Multilevel Inverters (MLI) are widely used in many industrial application such as drives, inverters and static VAR compensation etc. MLI is the most preferable choice in comparison with conventional inverters due to its various advantages such as less EMI issues, voltage stress and switching losses. It is important that inverter must produce harmonic free output which is to be fed to the load. In two level inverter, Harmonics can be eliminated by using large size of filters due to the lower order harmonics. This leads to increase the overall size, volume and cost of an inverter. MLI has an advantage that the lower order harmonics can be eliminated by choosing the proper switching angles is called as Selective Harmonic Elimination (SHE) technique. In this work, the Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) is applied to find the optimum switch angles to eliminate the lower order harmonics. CSA based optimization is applied for seven and nine level MLI provides better solution for eliminating lower order harmonics and reduction of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD).

We collated data from multiple studies and analyzed algae, benthic invertebrate, and fish community data from 186 stream sites, including un-mined streams, and those associated with 620 mines on the West Coast of the South Island, New Zealand. Algal, invertebrate, and fish richness responded to mine impacts and were significantly higher in un-mined compared to mine-impacted streams. Changes in community composition toward more acid- and metal-tolerant species were evident for algae and invertebrates, whereas changes in fish communities were significant and driven by a loss of nonmigratory native species. Consistent catchment-scale predictors of mining activities affecting biota included the time post mining (years), mining density (the number of mines upstream per catchment area), and mining intensity (tons of coal production per catchment area). Mining was associated with a decline in stream biodiversity irrespective of catchment size, and recovery was not evident until at least 30 years after mining activities have ceased. These catchment-scale predictors can provide managers and regulators with practical metrics to focus on management and remediation decisions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this paper, we propose an environment perception framework for autonomous driving using state representation learning (SRL). Unlike existing Q-learning based methods for efficient environment perception and object detection, our proposed method takes the learning loss into account under deterministic as well as stochastic policy gradient. Through a combination of variational autoencoder (VAE), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), and soft actor-critic (SAC), we focus on uninterrupted and reasonably safe autonomous driving without steering off the track for a considerable driving distance. Our proposed technique exhibits learning in autonomous vehicles under complex interactions with the environment, without being explicitly trained on driving datasets. To ensure the effectiveness of the scheme over a sustained period of time, we employ a reward-penalty based system where a negative reward is associated with an unfavourable action and a positive reward is awarded for favourable actions. The results obtained through simulations on DonKey simulator show the effectiveness of our proposed method by examining the variations in policy loss, value loss, reward function, and cumulative reward for ‘VAE+DDPG’ and ‘VAE+SAC’ over the learning process. © 2020 by the authors.

It is a priority to avoid the loss of relevant information such as event address, places references, names, etc. In this context it is present Named Entity Recognition (NER) analysis for discovering information into informal texts. Unlike structured corpus and labeled for NER analysis like CONLL2002 or ANCORA, informal texts generated from emergency call dialogues have a very wide linguistic variety; in addition, there is a strong tending to lose important information in their processing. A relevant aspect to considerate is the identification of texts that denotes entities such as the physical address where emergency events occurred. This study aims to extract the locations in which an emergency event has been issued. A set of experiments was performed with NER models based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The performance of models was evaluated according to parameters such as training dataset size, dropout rate, location dictionary, and denoting location. An experimentation methodology was proposed, with it follows the next steps: i) Data preprocessing, ii) Dataset labeling, iii) Model structuring, and iv) Model evaluating.

      " Abstract: This study examines the possibility of catch-up of the Chinese steel industry, in particular the Shougang Group, with the leading global steel giants. Shougang is one of the four steel companies that have been selected by the Chinese government to constitute the core of the future Chinese steel industry. The contract system at Shougang, which operated from 1979 to 1995, unleashed an extraordinary entrepreneurial energy in the formerly traditional state-run steel plant. In the post-contract system, Shougang's range of decision-making independence in respect to the purchase of inputs, its production structure and product marketing has increased substantially compared to the contract system, when the government still controlled many of the key decisions. As a result of institutional constraint, the low value-added steel products dominate Shougang's portfolio. To challenge the established giants in the steel industry, Shougang has to divest the loss-making non-core businesses, slowly downsize employment in the core business, raise capital on the stock market and generates the resources for continued upgrading of its steel technology and diversifying its product portfolio. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare both techniques and establish whether one of them should be used in preference to the other. The probability of getting a positive or negative result with each technique was the same regardless of the method used as reference. The biochemical method uses a larger volume of tissue to determine the receptor status than immunohistochemistry. In some cases, this means a loss of valuable information. If we only use one technique, there is the potential to misclassify ±11% of patients.

      " Abstract: Recently, new economic order/production quantity models have shifted away from focusing only on economic issues and towards combined economic-environmental concerns because of sustainable development goals. Despite this shift, only a few works have addressed sustainable Economic Production Quantity (EPQ). The theoretical sustainable EOQ and EPQ models are basic models that ignore many real-life conditions such as the possibility of stock-out in inventory systems. In this paper, we develop four new sustainable economic production quantity models that consider different shortage situations. To find optimal values of inventory system variables, we solve four independent profit maximization problems for four different situations. These proposed models include a basic model in which shortages are not allowed, and when shortages are allowed, the lost sale, full backordering and partial backordering models can be selected by operations managers depending on the manufacturer's motivation to improve service levels. We have also proposed an algorithm for determining optimum values of the decision variables for these sustainable economic production quantity models. Finally, the formulated models are explained with some different examples and the obtained results have been analyzed and discussed. These results show that the sustainable economic production quantity with partial backordering model is a general and more realistic model that can be used in many real cases with a reasonable profit amount, compared with the three other proposed models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: With considerable focus on ecotourism's potential to contribute to conservation, it is increasingly important to understand the implications of ecological information in triggering sustainability-relevant attitudes and actions. This study assesses whether people who have ecological information regarding the negative impact of their recreational behavior on penguins' stress will choose to remain farther away from the penguins to avoid that impact although this option will reduce the personal benefits of their tourism experience. To answer this question, we use a choice experiment with three attributes related to \"Humboldt penguin watching\": (1) price of the experience, (2) distance at which penguins could be observed, and (3) penguin density. In addition, we used two treatments: with and without ecological information. We used a pooled data (with and without information) mixed logit model to identify the effect of providing or not providing information. Using a chi-square test, we first tested whether people in the sample with information chose different alternatives than those individuals without information. Furthermore, we evaluate whether the coefficient associated with the attributes of the mixed logit model, and therefore people's behavioral preferences, differs among samples. Results show that, irrespective of socio-demographic differences, visitors with information were more prone to select alternatives that reduce penguin stress, despite more educated, wealthier, and older people tend to increase their welfare when they choose being closer to the penguins. People without information never choose the alternative which results in a reduction of penguin stress. Ecological information is shown to reverse this trend, in fact, tourists perceived (on average) a welfare loss of CL$1099 (US$1.9) if he/she is too close to the penguins once information has been granted. These results are encouraging because they support the claim that well-defined educational and informational campaigns can have important effects on the way in which people behave in areas of interest for conservation. Granting ecological information can become an important tool to encourage conservation behavior, particularly in areas where support for enforcement is weak. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Deciding between a passive heat and moisture exchanger or active humidification depends upon the level of humidification that either will deliver. Published international standards dictate that active humidifiers should deliver a minimum humidity of 33 mg.l-1; however, no such requirement exists, for heat and moisture exchangers. Tnaesthetists instead have to rely on information provided by manufacturers, which may not allow comparison of different devices and their clinical effectiveness. I suggest that measurement of humidification efficiency, being the percentage moisture returned and determined by measuring the temperature of the respired gases, should be mandated, and report a modification of the standard method that will allow this to be easily measured. In this study, different types of heat and moisture exchangers for adults, children and patients with a tracheostomy were tested. Tdult and paediatric models lost between 6.5 mg.l-1 and 8.5 mg.l-1 moisture (corresponding to an efficiency of around 80%); however, the models designed for patients with a tracheostomy lost between 16 mg.l-1 and 18 mg.l-1 (60% efficiency).

      " Abstract: A quasi-switched-capacitor (QSC) resonant converter is proposed for isolated dc/dc conversion in offline power supply application. Similar to the Φ2 resonant converter, the proposed converter is operated most efficiently at fixed switching frequency and duty ratio, and it features trapezoidal voltage waveforms on all switches. Full soft switching combining ZCS, ZVS on and off is achieved within a wide load range, and, therefore, the switching loss is minimized. In addition, compared to half/full-bridge converters (e.g., the LLC resonant converter and the dual-active-bridge converter), the proposed converter reduces the voltage stress on primary-side switches to 2/3 of the input voltage, and, thus, enables more choices of low-voltage devices, which are more efficient because of better figure of merit. Furthermore, the proposed converter reduces the transformer turns ratio by 2/3, and, thus, enables less number of turns of the winding, lower winding loss, and lower transformer leakage inductance, making it suitable for high-frequency operation. A 90-W 88-V/19-V 700-kHz prototype is built with 100-V eGaN FETs. The transformer design and PCB layout are presented to minimize the transformer leakage inductance and stray inductance.

      " Abstract: In a practical light emitted diodes (LEDs)-based visible light communication (VLC) system, high-speed transmission is generally limited by the LED bandwidth. To address the bandwidth limitation, a hybrid digital linear and decision-feedback equalization (DFE) is investigated to improve the transmission performance (or spectral efficiency) in the carrier-less amplitude phase modulation (CAP)-based VLC systems. A real-time CAP-VLC transceiver with the hybrid digital equalization is designed, based on which 200 Mb/s transmission is successfully demonstrated over a 15 m VLC link with the commercial red LEDs (bandwidth: 6.5 MHz). In the real-time CAP-VLC system, the baseline wander (BLW) is observed, due to the removal of the low-frequency components with a direct current (DC) block. The BLW effect can be mitigated by increasing the roll-off factor. However, this roll-off factor affects the equalization performance, due to an increased loss in the signal spectrum beyond the system bandwidth. Optimization of the roll-off factor and filter length is required. Experimental results show that, with the optimized real-time transceiver design, the hybrid Wiener/recursive least squares (RLS) and DFE significantly improves the error vector magnitude (EVM) performance compared with the DFE.

      " Abstract: Painful cuff tear arthropathy (CTA) affects the independence of the elderly. Surgical treatment often consists of joint replacement, the functional outcome of which remains variable. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of the different prosthetic designs can guide the orthopaedic surgeon in the choice of implant to predict its clinical result. A 3-D computer model of the glenohumeral joint is used to analyse the moment of the deltoid muscle in the scapular plane. A geometrical 3-D ball-and-socket model of the shoulder joint was used to calculate (1) the angle-force relationships, (2) the moment arm of the deltoid muscle and (3) the moment of the deltoid muscle components, for increasing degrees of arm elevation in the scapular plane. In this 3-D model, a clinical thoraco-scapular rhythm analysis was implemented, based on measurements in normal subjects, patients treated with an anatomical prosthesis and patients treated with an inversed delta III prosthesis®. These data were compared for 10 different prosthetic treatment options. Results. Muscle angle-force curves show a favourable slope in non-anatomical prosthetic designs, where the centre of rotation of the glenohumeral joint is medialized, the deltoid muscle is elongated and the humeral shaft is lateralized. On the contrary, anatomical prosthetic designs do not perform well in this computer analysis. Conclusions. From a biomechanical point of view, a shoulder prosthesis which medializes the centre of rotation, lengthens the deltoid muscle and increases the deltoid lever arm, results in a significantly more powerful abduction of the shoulder, despite complete loss of rotator cuff function.

      " Abstract: Absence of light, typical of the subterranean environment can lead to the loss of synchronizers of physiological and behavioral activities, mainly those related to photoperiods and light perception. Cave-dwelling species present phototactic responses that vary from photonegative to photopositive ones. There are few studies focusing on reaction to light in millipedes and the most studied species are considered photophobic. In this study, we analyzed the phototactic response of cave-dwelling and epigean millipedes of the genus Pseudonannolene (Spirostreptida, Pseudonannolenidae). For this, the chamber choice method was used. We related the phototatic reactions to morphological characters that indicate troglomorphisms (e.g., eyes and melanic pigmentation). The eight-studied operational taxonomic unit (OTU) showed photophobic reaction to all light intensities tested (150, 500 and 1000 lx) and photophobia can be considered a plesiomorphic character in the group. The morphological analysis showed that the light response is negatively correlated to the number of ommatidia and ocular area, that is, the larger the area and the number of ommatidia, the more negative is the light response (photonegative), suggesting that the eyes are the main sensory organs in the perception of light and, apparently, the integument of Pseudonannolene is not related to light sensitivity, opposite to that observed for other millipede species. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Cryphiops caementarius, is an endemic prawn from river ecosystems in Southern Perú and Northern Chile. In these watersheds, natural populations are threatened by multiple anthropic interventions such as mining activities and fishing pressure, but also, by increasing impacts of invasive exotic predators. Information related with predation on C. caementarius is scarce representing a major knowledge gap to ensure suitable management and conservation practices. Accordingly, the further deepening in relevant aspects such as the estimation of populations losses due to predators has been indicated as critical by relevant agencies as FAO. Objective: To conduct a complete registry and classification of C. caementarius predators, updating the knowledge for the Andean region. Methods: A thorough bibliographic review on existing information on C. caementarius’ predators from Perú and Chile was carried out calculating percentage of occurrence, relative frequency of species, zoogeographic origin, trophic structure, phenotypic attributes, river zone that inhabits and life stage of incidence. The registry was complemented using semi-structured interviews from prawn´s fishers in central-Northern Chile. Results: C. caementarius is predated along the entire fluvial network (estuary, potamon and rhithron) by 21 species of opportunists, carnivores, omnivores and herbivores, mostly aquatic vertebrates. In turn, these belong to 15 families and six guilds of native, exotic and cosmopolitan species. Approximately 86 % predate on adult prawns, whilst, 71 % on juveniles and 24 % on larvae. More than 40 % of the predation pressure seems to be exerted by native waterfowls and 24 % by exotic fish. Conclusions: The results emphasize the relevance for conservation of native species of predators in the Andean region and the need of control measures on exotic species in a latitudinal basis. Accordingly, this review may serve as an initial decision-making tool for future conservation efforts both on prawns and native biota, but also supporting restocking actions, fisheries management plans and risk assessment for C. caementarius populations across the Andean region. © 2020, Universidad de Costa Rica.

      " Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze how critical factors at different levels in a health-care system interact and impact nurses’ intention to leave and decision to quit their job at a hospital unit. Methods: A case study of assistant and registered nurses’ intentions to leave as well as staff turnover at a smaller Swedish public hospital was performed. Employee surveys and interviews with assistant and registered nurses who had quit their job at four units in the hospital during the period 2012–2019 were performed. Critical factors regarding nurses’ intention to leave and staff turnover are analyzed by combining narrative methods with a critical incidence technique. Results: Three main themes emerge from the analysis of factors contributing to the decision to quit, namely lack or loss of buffering factors, not owning your spare time and not feeling valued by and listened to by upper management. Conclusion: Decision-makers, including hospital management, need to consider how supportive factors in nurses’ closest work environment that promote staff retention may be impacted by decisions at higher levels, such as health-care reorganizations and stricter governance. In this context, upper management adopting a servant leadership approach might contribute to employees to a greater extent feeling valued and being listened to. Finally, the results indicate that individual nurses’ recovery, ability to work and ability to coordinate their personal life with their work life need to be supported by policies and decisions at higher levels in order to retain nurses in intensive and emergency health-care settings. © 2022 Eriksson et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Notch signaling governs binary cell fate determination in asymmetrically dividing cells. Through a forward genetic screen we identified the fly homologue of Eps15 homology domain containing protein-binding protein 1 (dEHBP1) as a novel regulator of Notch signaling in asymmetrically dividing cells. dEHBP1 is enriched basally and at the actin-rich interface of pII cells of the external mechanosensory organs, where Notch signaling occurs. Loss of function of dEHBP1 leads to up-regulation of Sanpodo, a regulator of Notch signaling, and aberrant trafficking of the Notch ligand, Delta. Furthermore, Sec15 and Rab11, which have been previously shown to regulate the localization of Delta, physically interact with dEHBP1. We propose that dEHBP1 functions as an adaptor molecule for the exocytosis and recycling of Delta, thereby affecting cell fate decisions in asymmetrically dividing cells. © 2012 Giagtzoglou et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Many problems in scientific investigation generate nonprecise data incorporating nonstatistical uncertainty. A nonprecise observation of a quantitative variable can be described by a special type of membership function defined on the set of all real numbers called a fuzzy number or a fuzzy interval. A methodology for constructing control charts is proposed when the quality characteristics are vague, uncertain, incomplete or linguistically defined. Fuzzy set theory is an inevitable tool for fuzzy control charts as well as other applications subjected to uncertainty in any form. The vagueness can be handled by transforming incomplete or nonprecise quantities to their representative scalar values such as fuzzy mode, fuzzy midrange, fuzzy median, or fuzzy average. Then crisp methods may be applied to those representative values for control chart decisions as \"in control\" or \"out of control\". Transforming the vague data by using one of the transformation methods may result in biased decisions since the information given by the vague data is lost by the transformation. Such data needs to be investigated as fuzzy sets without transformation, and the decisions based on the vague data should not be concluded with an exact decision. A \"direct fuzzy approach (DFA)\" to fuzzy control charts for attributes under vague data is proposed without using any transformation method. Then, the unnatural patterns for the proposed fuzzy control charts are defined using the probabilities of fuzzy events. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper presents a multi-criteria decision analysis for environmental risk assessment (ERA) with regard to avoiding and eliminating damages and loss under natural disasters in international airport projects. It starts from an assumption that the strategy of eliminating damages and losses under natural disasters is related to the location selection problem, and it is necessary to use the multi-criteria decision analysis for calculated decision-making support. The paper uses the analytic network process (ANP) to demonstrate one of its utility modes in decision-making support to location selection problems, which aims at an evaluation of different projects from different locations. A set of generic criteria for risk assessment at international projects was put forward to support ANP modelling, and it was due to the consideration of social, technical, economic, environmental and political (STEEP) criteria related to the built, social and natural (BSN) trinity environment of international airport projects. At the end, an experimental case study on three international hub airports in China is given to test the ANP model called ERA.Airport, and it is concluded that ANP can be effectively used for risk assessment in the specific utility mode. The ERA.Airport is a generic multi-criteria decision-making model and can be used across the world for accurate environmental risk assessment for international airports. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. and IPMA.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This study investigates the influence of subjective interpretations of strategy-relevant cues, specifically, perceived control/uncontrol and perceived gain/loss, on the relationship between causation or effectuation approach and the likelihood of initial venture sales. The results support the greater likelihood of initial sales when the entrepreneur increasingly relies on causation (albeit at low to medium levels) and has a greater perception of control. Similarly, perceived gains (instead of losses) strengthen the positive relationship between effectuation and initial sales. These results extend previous research on influence of the perceptions of control/uncontrol and gain/loss by supporting the influence of such subjective interpretations for strategic decision making. Furthermore, this study responds to recent calls for research on the different interpretations of the same environmental conditions and the resulting consequences for entrepreneurs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Studies have shown improved quality of life for hemodialysis (HD) patients after changing from conventional thrice-weekly HD treatment to more frequent HD. Methods: In the London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study, 23 patients (11 patients, short daily HD; 12 patients, long nocturnal HD) were compared with 22 conventional thrice-weekly HD patients serving as controls. All patients completed 3 sets of quality-of-life assessment tools: (1) a locally developed renal disease-specific questionnaire that assessed dialysis symptoms, uremic symptoms, psychosocial stress, and social-leisure activity; (2) the generic Medical Outcomes Survey 36-item Short Form (SF-36); and (3) the global Health Utilities Index (HUI). As a supplement to the HUI, a subset of patients was asked to complete the Time Trade-Off assessment. Results: Overall, the reduction in symptoms shows better fluid management because quotidian HD patients reported experiencing fewer and less severe cramping during dialysis, fewer headaches, less hypotension, fewer episodes of dizziness, decreased fluid restrictions, fewer blood pressure problems, decreased interdialytic weight gains, fewer episodes of shortness of breath, and a reduction in the sensation of easily feeling cold. HUI results showed that quotidian HD patients maintained functionality throughout the study period, whereas control patients showed a significant loss. Given the choice, all patients chose to remain on quotidian HD therapy after switching from conventional HD therapy. The Time Trade-Off analysis indicated that study patients were willing to trade far less time on quotidian HD therapy and much more time on conventional HD therapy in exchange for \"perfect\" health. Conclusion: As more studies focus on improved patient outcomes and appropriate funding mechanisms are established, more frequent home HD treatment should become a standard treatment option for patients with end-stage renal disease. © 2003 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Decision-making strategies shift during normal aging and can profoundly affect wellbeing. Although overweighing losses compared to gains, termed “loss aversion,” plays an important role in choice selection, the age trajectory of this effect and how it may be influenced by associated changes in brain structure remain unclear. We therefore investigated the relationship between age and loss aversion, and tested for its mediation by cortical thinning in brain regions that are susceptible to age-related declines and are implicated in loss aversion — the insular, orbitofrontal, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. Healthy participants (n = 106, 17–54 years) performed the Loss Aversion Task. A subgroup (n = 78) provided structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Loss aversion followed a curvilinear trajectory, declining in young adulthood and increasing in middle-age, and thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex mediated this trajectory. The findings suggest that beyond a threshold in middle adulthood, atrophy of the posterior cingulate cortex influences loss aversion. © Copyright © 2021 Guttman, Ghahremani, Pochon, Dean and London.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Today, obesity is the most important modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes. An excess of body fat is associated with a deterioration of glucose utilisation and promotes the development of type 2 diabetes, particularly in those with a genetic predisposition for the disease. It is also well established that a reduction of excess body fat improves insulin sensitivity and can prevent the conversion to diabetes. In those with overt diabetes, weight loss usually ameliorates glycaemic control and associated metabolic disturbances. Among the pharmacological agents that are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes only metformin has a weak weight-lowering activity and is considered as the drug of choice for adjunct pharmacotherapy in obese diabetic subjects. A few studies also suggest that acarbose can induce a modest weight reduction in such patients. In contrast, sulphonylurea and insulin treatment is frequently accompanied by substantial weight gain which should be taken into consideration when these drugs are used. Another approach to improve metabolic control in obese type 2 diabetic patients is the use of weight-lowering agents. The new serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor sibutramine promotes weight loss which subsequently leads to improved glycaemic control. Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, is also able to ameliorate metabolic control in such patients due to its weight-lowering potential. As obesity remains a therapeutic challenge in most type 2 diabetic subjects, weight management drugs may represent an alternative or supplement to antidiabetic agents. Moreover, weight management agents have the advantage that they have additional favourable effects on associated cardiovascular risk factors. © 1999 Stockton Press.

      " Abstract: The function of a foraging trip (self-feeding or provisioning) and the spatial distribution of food resources play an essential role in foraging decisions of central-place foragers. Theory predicts that if foraging patches optimal for self-feeding and provisioning are spatially separated, a bimodal foraging strategy should often be favored. A bimodal foraging strategy involves the alternation of short feeding trips (ST) to collect food for offspring with long trips (LT) for self-feeding, as previously described in some procellariiform seabirds. Using an automated passage recording and weighing system, we tested whether the bimodal trip pattern observed in little auks (Alle alle), a small Arctic alcid, reflects a corresponding functional difference of bimodal foraging trips. We found that the body mass trajectory of little auks was closely related to their bimodal trip pattern. Little auks weighed significantly more returning from a LT and lost an equivalent amount of mass during subsequent ST. The decision to start a LT was not directly related to body mass but seemed to depend on the individual strategy of a bird. During LT, birds likely utilized distant foraging areas suitable for self-feeding while relying on near-shore areas during ST. These results support predictions of recent foraging models and indicate that the function of long and short trips of little auks is similar to procellariiforms independent of large differences in the temporal and spatial scale of feeding trips among these taxa. We suggest that bimodal foraging might be more widespread among central-place foragers than previously thought. © 2012 The Author.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it with a new stake - for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite with another bet on a promising upstart. In three experiments, the authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security by minimizing losses, known as a \"prevention orientation,\" or to pursue growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a \"promotion orientation.\" When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people; similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3).

Methods: Over the last 3 years, 151 BIB systems have been endoscopically placed and filled with 500-700 ml of saline plus 10 ml of methylene blue in 131 patients (mean age 38.4 years, range 18-72); males/females 46/85; mean BMI 43.8 kg/m2). In all patients abdominal U/S was carried out before and 1-2 days after endoscopy and thereafter at scheduled follow-up examinations, and/or whenever the subject complained of epigastric burning/ache, vomiting, and lack of sensation of a BIB with or without staining of urine and/or feces. Results: The BIB appeared as a round anechoic structure, with a thick hyperechoic wall and a hyperechoic band-like valve inside. Complications occurred in 18 patients: in 8, staining of urine and/or feces prompted immediate endoscopic removal. In 10 patients, U/S findings were: 1) decreased volume, loss of the spherical shape with the valve still visible (5 cases); 2) multiple hyperechoic streaks regularly spaced due to a completely collapsed BIB, not modified by decubitus changes (3 cases); 3) migration through the intestine (2 cases): in one patient the BIB was passed in the stools after 4 days, whereas in the other case large bowel obstruction required laparoscopic surgery.

      " Abstract: Highly modified coasts are associated to sub-optimal provision of ecosystem services, causing biodiversity losses and negative impacts on social welfare. Although ecological arguments can justify the restoration of coastal environments, technical, social and economic issues often pose complex obstacles to implement efficient restorations. Indeed, there is a lack of socioeconomic assessments in both academic literature and policy decision-making showing whether the restoration of highly modified coasts are socially acceptable and economically efficient. This paper presents the case of the Portmán Bay (SE Spain), described as the most polluted coastal area by mining activities in the entire Mediterranean region. The question on how to restore the bay has been under debate for decades and there is not social and political consensus about its restoration yet. Our results suggest that, in terms of social preferences and net benefits, the preferred alternative would be to recover the coast and improve habitat continuity between the bay and other adjacent natural areas. Development of other economic activities incompatible with natural conservation could only compensate social welfare losses by increasing public taxation on private sector. Our results confirm that, once social preferences are taken into account, the restoration of heavily modified coastal ecosystems can be economically efficient even though it implies significant technical constraints and high public expenditures. © 2023 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

Central to these is the extent to which precedent autonomous decisions should be respected in the absence of a legally binding advance decision. Well-being interests can survive the loss of many of the psychological faculties that support personhood.

      " Abstract: Since 2002 extensive studies have been carried out on the surface scatters of Early and Middle Stone Age (ESA and MSA) artefacts in western Namibia, with additional studies in north-central and southern Namibia. The distribution of intense artefact scatters coincides with geological formations that contain quartzitic sandstones that were the preferred lithic resource for tool manufacture. Away from these rocks, surface artefacts still occur but with much less frequency. In this, the first ever large-scale survey of surface scatters from the Palaeolithic, it is argued that despite loss of buried context, surface studies offer information on Palaeolithic lifestyles that cannot be obtained from excavation alone. It is shown beyond doubt that on flat surfaces away from streams larger cutting tools are likely to remain roughly where they were dropped indefinitely. By use of the Edge Test, a digital program to measure amount of section mass lost from artefact edges, the relative age of different typologies from surface contexts can be demonstrated. The evidence from Western Namibia suggests that choice of settlement areas in the ESA and early MSA was determined not only by available water but also by access to quality lithic raw material, and that early humans were accomplished field geologists.

      " Abstract: Resource scarcity within a fragile state can lead to cooperation or within-state conflict. Cooperation is more likely when local peacebuilding mechanisms are part of a national peace framework. A new local peacebuilding mechanism, shared forest cooperatives (SFC), is proposed here. Designed to stabilize peace in rural communities, SFC refers to a network of local councils. Each council manages a living bank, namely annual dividends harvested from a forest ecosystem or other perennial plants. SFC's backbone for managing forest dividends is Elinor Ostrom's common-pool resource principles. Each SFC group relies on the backbone when choosing its own rights, rules and obligations. Ostrom's monitoring principle of higher-level support, or polycentrism, presents difficulty for fragile states. Outside intervention covers binding decisions, technical expertise and hosting neutral space for face-to-face dialogue initially. SFC's design, theory and practice draws from four elements: 1) where SFC fits within the current intervention practices, 2) SFC's reliance on shared land usage and occupancy typical for most of the world's nine most fragile states, namely Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Sudan, Afghanistan, Central African Republic and Syria, 3) adapting Elinor Ostrom's common-pool resource principles for sharing each living bank's dividends 4) better governance based on local peace council experiences. Elements are folded into a synthesis and its critique then policy implications. Socially fragile, SFC is proposed as a 2-for-1 mechanism for building peace in rural communities while minimizing forest loss. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Preference of con- over heterospecific mates leading to assortative mating can substantially contribute to pre-zygotic reproductive isolation and prevent fitness losses if post-zygotic hybridization barriers already exist. The jewel wasp genus Nasonia displays quite strong and well-studied post-zygotic reproductive isolation due to a ubiquitous Wolbachia infection causing cytoplasmic incompatibility between different species. Pre-zygotic isolation, however, has received far less research attention in this model organism, especially concerning the mechanisms and criteria of mate choice. In the present study, we analysed mate rejection and mate acceptance rates in cross-comparisons between all four Nasonia species. We put emphasis on observing which sex is more likely to interrupt interspecific matings and how discriminatory behaviour varies across the different species in all possible combinations. We found an asymmetric distribution of assortative mating among the four Nasonia species that appears to be highly influenced by the respective combinations of sex and species. Females appeared to be the main discriminators against heterospecific mating partners, but interestingly, we could also detect mate discrimination and rejection behaviour in males, a widely neglected factor in research on mating behaviour in general and on Nasonia in particular. Moreover, the asymmetry in the assortative mating behaviour was partially reflective of sym- or allopatric distributions of natural Nasonia populations. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract:                              Background: The aim was to analyze characteristics that predict remission induction and subsequent loss of remission in patients with moderately active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received full-dose combination etanercept plus methotrexate induction therapy followed by reduced-dose etanercept or etanercept withdrawal. Methods: Patients with Disease Activity Score based on 28-joint count (DAS28) >3.2 and ≤5.1 received open-label etanercept 50 mg once weekly (QW) plus methotrexate for 36 weeks. Those who achieved DAS28 low disease activity by 36 weeks were randomized to double-blind treatment with etanercept 50 mg or 25 mg QW plus methotrexate or placebo plus methotrexate for 52 weeks. All analyses were adjusted for the continuous baseline variables of their respective remission outcomes. Results: Younger age, body mass index (BMI) <30 kg/m                             2                             , and lower Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score at baseline were significant predictors of week-36 remission (P < 0.05) based on DAS28, Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI), and Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI). Baseline DAS28, SDAI, and CDAI were significantly predictive of all three remission endpoints (P < 0.05). For all three treatments, the strongest predictors of loss of DAS28 remission included failure to achieve sustained remission (DAS28 < 2.6 at weeks 12, 20, 28, and 36) with induction therapy, higher DAS28/SDAI/CDAI at randomization and at 1 month, increase in DAS28/SDAI/CDAI at 1 month, and increase in DAS28/CDAI/SDAI components and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) at 1 month. With the exception of not achieving sustained remission, very similar significant predictors were observed for loss of SDAI and CDAI remission. Conclusion: These findings suggest that patients with moderately active RA who are younger and have lower BMI, lower HAQ, and lower disease activity at baseline are most likely to achieve remission when receiving combination etanercept and methotrexate induction therapy. In addition, patients who fail to achieve sustained remission with induction therapy and those with worse disease activity and PROs at early time points after initiating maintenance therapy with a full-dose or reduced-dose etanercept-methotrexate regimen or methotrexate monotherapy are most likely to lose remission across all treatment arms. These findings may help guide clinicians' decision-making as they treat patients to remission and beyond. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00565409.

The objective of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the development of the relationships between cost of failure and time lost due to equipment failure, cost of inventory and time lost due to shortages of material, cost of set up and time lost due to set up, cost of absenteeism and time lost due to absenteeism, and cost of material handling and time lost due to material handling. Relationships are established scientifically using regression modelling, simulation and discussions with domain experts. Results are validated in an operational vehicle assembly line. The results demonstrate that the established models follows a cubic relationship as against the hyperbolic relationship previously reported in literature.

      " Abstract: Introduction The aim of this study was to explore the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after a lateral screw was combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw for a type II odontoid fracture and hopefully provide references in decision making and surgical planning for spinal surgeons. Methods This is a retrospective study. By retrieving the medical records from January 2010 to July 2015 in our hospital, 117 type II odontoid fracture patients were reviewed. According to the occurrence of fracture union at the final follow-up, patients were divided into 2 groups: union and nonunion. To investigate the predisposing factors for fracture nonunion, 3 categorized factors were analyzed statistically: patient characteristics—age, sex, body mass index, preoperative Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, duration, comorbidity, and complicated injuries; surgical variables—surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2; radiographic parameters—preoperative and immediate postoperative data of C0-2 curvature, C2-7 curvature, C2-7 sagittal vertical axis, C7 slope, fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, and the separation and displacement of the odontoid fracture. Other variables including JOA and visual analog scale scores for neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up were recorded and compared between the 2 groups. Results Postoperative fracture nonunion was detected in 76 of 117 patients (65%) at final follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in patient characteristics of sex, body mass index, JOA score, comorbidity, and complicated injuries. The mean age at operation was younger in the union group than in the nonunion group, and the mean duration was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. There was no difference in surgical variables of surgery time, blood loss, C2 fixation manner, vertebral artery injury, bone source for fusion between the posterior arch of C1 and the laminae and spinous process of C2. There was no difference in radiographic parameters of fracture classification, congenital hypoplastic vertebral artery, preoperative and immediate postoperative C0-2 curvature, C2-7 curvature, C2-7 SVA, and C7 slope. No difference was found in preoperative and immediate postoperative displacement of the odontoid fracture or immediate postoperative separation of the odontoid fracture, while the preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture was shorter in the union group than in the nonunion group. The logistic regression analysis revealed that advanced age (>45 years), long duration (>2 months), and preoperative separation of the odontoid fracture (>4 mm) were independently associated with the postoperative fracture nonunion. There were no differences between the 2 groups in JOA, neck pain, neck stiffness, and patient satisfaction at final follow-up. Conclusions Advanced age, long duration, and preoperative separation of odontoid fracture >4 mm are predisposing factors for fracture nonunion after posterior C1 lateral screw combined with C2 pedicle/laminar screw fixation for type II odontoid fracture. Our findings did not demonstrate any evidence of lower functional outcome and patients satisfaction for those patients who had odontoid nonunion. © 2017\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: The tubeless percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was proposed to eliminate the side effects of the nephrostomy tube in recent years, such as pain, channel infection, postoperative bleeding, and longer hospital stay. But there is neither clinical guidelines nor consensus about tubeless PCNL in clinical practice. The study is aimed to how to implement the tubeless PCNL step by step, including case selection preoperatively, improving the technique of the surgeon, making the correct decisions at the end of the procedure, which had not been previously examined. Methods: From January 2017 to March 2018, 364 consecutive patients requiring PCNL were comprehensively analyzed preoperatively and patients were selected for scheduled tubeless PCNL based on four aspects. The selected patients were divided into two groups according to whether the nephrostomy tube was finally placed. The mean operative time, intraoperative blood loss, stone clearance rate, visual pain score, postoperative hospitalization days and perioperative complications were all evaluated. Results: Based on the preoperative evaluation, 42 patients were selected for tubeless PCNL, among which there were finally 37 cases of completed tubeless PCNL. Compared with patients undergoing conventional PCNL, there were not statistical differences in the mean operative time (P=0.207) or intraoperative blood loss (P=0.450) in the tubeless group. Stone clearance rate was 100% in both groups. The visual pain scores in the tubeless PCNL group were lower on operation day (P=0.029), first postoperative day (P<0.001) and the day of discharge (P=0.025). The postoperative hospitalization for the tubeless PCNL group was shorter than that of the control group (P<0.001). No significant difference in grade 1 complications was seen (P=0.424), and no grade 2 or higher complications were observed in either group. Conclusions: Postoperative pain was significantly relieved and postoperative hospitalization was significantly shortened in the tubeless PCNL group. Tubeless PCNL is safe if patients are carefully selected using four criteria before operation, attention is paid to four key points and five confirmations are made during operation.  © Translational Andrology and Urology.

      " Abstract: Introduction: Reconstruction of the sole is an extremely challenging problem for a reconstructive microsurgeon. The specialized nature of its skin and subcutaneous tissue makes reconstruction arduous. When posed with complex bilateral lower extremity trauma where one limb was nonsalvageable, we harvested the uninjured foot fillet flap for free flap cover to reconstruct the contralateral sole. We report two such cases with follow-up assessment. Patients and Methods: Two cases of sole reconstruction with emergency foot fillet free flap scavenged from the amputated contralateral limb were retrospectively analyzed. In both the patients, foot fillet free flap based on the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle was used. The follow-up assessment data collected included flap status, presence of any complications and prosthesis use, and functional status of the limbs at final follow-up. Results: Both the free flaps survived. Postoperative period was uneventful. No complications such as wound infection, delayed healing, flap necrosis, or scar breakdown were noted. The plantar flaps had recovery of protective sensation. Both the patients are ambulant; the first man with a fitted prosthesis and the second woman with the aid of a walker. Conclusion: The opportunity to utilize spare tissue from the amputated limb should be seized. Loss of the plantar aspect of foot poses a real challenge. The plantar foot fillet free flap is a durable flap with preservation of plantar sensations. It is probably the best choice as it replaces “like with like.” Prerequisites for utilizing the “spare part surgery” concept are meticulous initial debridement as well as emergency free tissue transfer, which require senior input and excellent infrastructure. © 2023 Society for Indian Hand Surgery and Micro Surgeons.

      " Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) provide advice to physicians that could save patients’ lives, but they could also make physicians feel losing face. Considering the pivotal role of face in social interactions in China, this research attempts to understand Chinese physicians’ dilemma of choosing between saving face or saving patients and how this dilemma makes them reluctant to follow CDSS recommendations. Drawing from the dual process theory, we postulate that physicians’ resistance to CDSS recommendations is reduced by their rational perception of the system’s usefulness and increased by their experiential belief of face loss and that these effects are contingent on two contextual factors, professional autonomy, and time pressure. Based on a longitudinal field survey with 182 physicians and follow-up interviews in a large Chinese hospital, we find support for the opposing effects of face loss and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we show that face loss has a stronger effect on CDSS resistance at a high level of professional autonomy. In addition, when time pressure is high, perceived usefulness more strongly reduces while face loss more strongly increases CDSS resistance, thus amplifying the dilemma. This research makes a significant contribution by integrating the concept of face loss into information technology resistance research and revealing the dark side of professional autonomy and the paradoxical moderating effect of time pressure in the healthcare context. © 2021 INFORMS\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The amount of electronic waste, such as used mobile phones and computers, has been experiencing a sharp increase due to factors, including continuous product updates, short product life cycles and a large number of users. Determining ways to recycle and dispose of electronic waste effectively has become an important issue requiring worldwide attention. The rapid development of information and internet technology has brought new techniques to recycle electronic waste in recent years. Because of the advantages of being light in weight and easy to carry, electronic waste, such as used mobile phones and computers, can be recycled conveniently for customers through the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform. Therefore, the ‘Internet +’ platform is regarded as an effective way to increase the recycling rate of electronic waste. However, during the process of ‘Internet +’ recycling, the final recycling prices of used products are usually uncertain for customers. They worry that the recycling platform might use the lack of information transparency during the quality inspection process to deliberately decrease the recycling prices and then buy low and sell high to make a profit. In addition, the large deviation between final recycling prices and the platform′s estimated prices may be unacceptable for customers, resulting in a low recycling rate of electronic waste by the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform that is far below the desired level. Further, consumers with irrational behaviours may regard these estimated prices as references for recycling prices of used products. When the final recycling price of a used product is lower than its estimated price, a consumer might exhibit loss aversion characteristics. This study investigates the optimal pricing decision of the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform. Based on the uncertainty of the recycling price on the online recycling platform, this work considers the impact of consumer loss aversion characteristics on pricing decisions. By assuming the scenarios of consumers with or without loss aversion characteristics, three pricing models are constructed under the situations where the rating of used products′ pricing with mismatched quality is based on the following factors: their real quality level, incomplete information and complete information. Furthermore, a comparison analysis of the constructed models in terms of the optimal pricing strategy and the profit of the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform is conducted. From the study, some meaningful results are as follows: first, when the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform re-prices used products with mismatched quality ratings, the following two pricing strategies can be adopted. If the differences among the residuals of used products with varying quality grades are not large, then used products with mismatched quality ratings should not be re-priced to avoid possible monetary losses. Conversely, re-pricing of used products with mismatched quality ratings should be done when the differences among the residuals of used products with varying quality grades are large. Second, considering the time-sensitivity of the used products price and loss in value of used products because of the disassembly operation of the recycling platform, this study suggested that the value loss factor of returning used products increases and the number of consumers returning used products decreases, increasing the profit of the recycling platform thereby. However, these models do not imply that the recycling platform can increase the recycling platform′s revenue by increasing the value loss of used products because the time lapsed from participating in online recycling to returning a used product is quite short. In addition, the loss of value of returning the used products results from the dismantling behaviour of the recycling platform. Because of this, consumers may lose their trust in the recycling platform and will no longer participate in online recycling. Third, regardless of whether consumers have loss aversion characteristics, the recycling platform gains the lowest profit in the model where used products with mismatched quality ratings are directly priced based on their true quality level. Conversely, the recycling platform gains the highest profit under the secondary pricing model, where the proportion of used products with mismatched quality ratings is predictable. Finally, consumer loss aversion characteristics negatively impact the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform. The higher the percentage of consumers holding low-value used products, the percentage of used products with mismatched quality ratings or the level of consumer loss aversion, the greater the positive impact of the complete information pricing decision model and the greater the negative impact of consumer loss aversion on the recycling platform. In practice, the recycling platform can increase its revenue in the following ways: First, it should reasonably set up the website′s price evaluation system. With reasonable strategies, such as reducing the proportion of used products with mismatched quality ratings, avoiding an excessively detailed classification of evaluation options to obscure consumers′ choices or reducing the number of quality grade of used products to widen the gap among different quality levels of used products, the recycling platform may increase its revenue and alleviate the impacts of consumer loss aversion characteristics. Second, in the case of used products with mismatched quality ratings and consumer loss aversion characteristics, the recycling platform should collect historical data and estimate the proportion of used products with mismatched quality ratings. Thus, the recycling platform can increase its revenue and reduce the negative impact of consumer loss aversion characteristics using the pricing decision model under complete information. © 2022,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.

      " Abstract: The next generation of dark-energy imaging surveys - so called \"Stage-IV\"surveys, such as that of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) - will cross a threshold in the number density of detected sources on the sky that requires qualitatively different image analysis and measurement techniques compared to the current generation of Stage-III surveys. In Stage-IV surveys, a significant amount of the cosmologically useful information is due to sources whose images overlap with those of other sources on the sky. We focus on the weak gravitational lensing probe, for which we expect the largest impact since the cosmic shear signal is primarily encoded in the estimated shapes of observed galaxies and thus directly impacted by overlaps. We introduce a framework based on the Fisher formalism to analyze the effect of the overlapping sources (\"blending\") on the estimation of cosmic shear. This method gives concrete predictions for the minimum loss of information due to noise and blending for any choice of \"deblending\"scheme and shape-measurement algorithm. Our studies account for undetected sources but do not address their full effects and biases they may introduce. We use simulated images and predict this impact of blending for three surveys: the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper-Suprime Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP), and the Rubin LSST. Our methodology successfully estimates the statistical sensitivity to weak lensing for DES and HSC early results. For LSST, we present the expected loss in statistical sensitivity for the ten-year survey due to blending. We find that for approximately 62% of galaxies that are likely to be detected in full-depth LSST images, at least 1% of the flux in their pixels is from overlapping sources. We also find that the statistical correlations between measures of overlapping galaxies and, to a much lesser extent (0.2%) the higher shot noise level due to their presence, decrease the effective number density of galaxies, N eff, by ∼ 18%. We calculate an upper limit on N eff of 39.4 galaxies per arcmin2 in r band. We study the impact of stars on as a function of stellar density and illustrate the diminishing returns of extending the survey into lower Galactic latitudes. We extend the simulation-based Fisher formalism to predict the expected increase in pixel-noise bias due to blending for maximum-likelihood (ML) shape estimators. We find that noise bias depends sensitively on the particular shape estimator and measure of ensemble-average shape that is used, and properties of the galaxy that include redshift-dependent quantities such as size and luminosity.

      " Abstract: To improve Greenland Ice Sheet surface mass balance (SMB) simulation, the subsurface scheme of the HIRHAM5 regional climate model was extended to include snow densification, varying hydraulic conductivity, irreducible water saturation and other effects on snow liquid water percolation and retention. Sensitivity experiments to investigate the effects of the additions and the impact of different parameterization choices are presented. Compared with 68 accumulation area ice cores, the simulated mean annual net accumulation bias is −5% (correlation coefficient of 0.90). Modeled SMB in the ablation area compares favorably with 1041 PROMICE observations with regression slope of 0.95–0.97 (depending on model configuration), correlation coefficient of 0.75–0.86 and mean bias −3%. Weighting ablation area SMB biases at low- and high-elevation with the amount of runoff from these areas, we estimate ice sheet-wide mass loss biases in the ablation area at −5 and −7% using observed (MODIS-derived) and internally calculated albedo, respectively. Comparison with observed melt day counts shows that patterns of spatial (correlation ∼0.9) and temporal (correlation coefficient of ∼0.9) variability are realistically represented in the simulations. However, the model tends to underestimate the magnitude of inter-annual variability (regression slope ∼0.7) and overestimate that of spatial variability (slope ∼1.2). In terms of subsurface temperature structure and occurrence of perennial firn aquifers and perched ice layers, the most important model choices are the albedo implementation and irreducible water saturation parameterization. At one percolation area location, for instance, the internally calculated albedo yields too high subsurface temperatures below 5 m, but when using an implementation of irreducible saturation allowing higher values, an ice layer forms in 2011, reducing the deep warm bias in subsequent years. On the other hand, prior to the formation of the ice layer, observed albedos combined with lower irreducible saturation give the smallest bias. Perennial firn aquifers and perched ice layers occur in varying thickness and area for different model parameter choices. While the occurrence of these features has an influence on the local-scale subsurface temperature, snow, ice and water fields, the Greenland-wide runoff and SMB are—in the model’s current climate—dominated by the albedo implementation. © 2017 Langen, Fausto, Vandecrux, Mottram and Box.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Parametric and semiparametric regression beyond the mean have become important tools for multivariate data analysis in this world of heteroscedasticity. Among several alternatives, quantile regression is a very popular choice if regression on more than a location measure is desired. This is also due to the inherent robustness of a quantile estimate. However, when moving towards the tails of a distribution, the handling of extreme observations becomes crucial for empirical estimates. M-quantiles handle outliers within the regression analysis by imposing a strong robustness to the loss function. However, this loss function is typically not designed to handle heteroscedasticity. An adaptive extension to the degree of robustness within the loss function is proposed along with the implementation of semiparametric predictors in an M-quantile regression model. A practical method to compute confidence intervals is also presented. The methods are supported by extensive simulations and an analysis of childhood malnutrition in Tanzania. © 2019 EcoSta Econometrics and Statistics\u001b[0m :\n",

Hand-off dropping or cell overload are consequences of congestion in wireless networks. Our call admission control algorithm takes into consideration the number of calls in adjacent cells, in addition to the number of calls in the cell where a new call request is made, in order to make a call admission decision. This is done by every base station in a distributed manner without the involvement of the network call processor. The admission condition is simple enough that the admission decision can be made in real time. Furthermore, we show that our distributed call admission control scheme limits the handoff dropping or the cell overload probability to a predefined level almost independent of load conditions.

      " Abstract: The funding of public education in America has been a primary concern for government officials at the federal, state, and local levels for several generations. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, this expenditure accounts for the single largest allocation in most state and local government operating budgets (Stanley and French 2004). The Great Recession and its aftermath, has intensified the need for effective financial management strategies for school districts as the housing market has seen a significant drop in prices resulting in revenue losses in the form of unrealized real estate taxes. Therefore, the political and economic climate in Pennsylvania demands an easy to use tool to help school administrators and School Board members make effective financial decisions. With limited time and resources, public administrators and elected officials, need a tool that is both comprehensive and easy to use. Ken Brown's 10 Point Test, first published in 1993, provides an example of such a tool. This tool was developed for local municipalities with populations less than 100,000. Therefore, some modifications were made to the test to apply it to school district finance. The model that we have developed offers only a comparative tool for the assessment of financial condition, but when applied to public school finances for school districts with identical regulatory restrictions (i.e., on a state by state basis) school administrators, and Board members, can use the results along with other criteria, to determine their district's financial performance. We adapted Brown's test to fit the requirements of school districts, and then average each district's score over five years to provide a longitudinal component not seen in Brown's methodology. When performed on an annual basis for all districts in a state, a chart of quartile limits can be provided to individual districts every year so that local decision-makers can see the effects of their actions even before they are made. It is important to note that this test is a measure of financial condition and just one factor of many that should be considered in the determination of financial health. Other factors, such as the presence of and adherence to a long range capital plan, infrastructure condition, presence and status of CBA's and demographic/economic information all have an impact on overall financial health. The current economic environment, with the reductions in revenue and overall economic uncertainty for school districts, makes a system to determine the financial health of school districts essential for local school district leaders and state policymakers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Land suitability assessment is a prerequisite phase in land use planning; it guides toward optimal land use by providing information on the opportunities and constraints involved in the use of a given land area. A geographic information system-based procedure, known as rural settlement suitability evaluation (RSSE) using an improved technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), was adopted to determine the most suitable area for constructing rural settlements in different geographical locations. Given the distribution and independence of rural settlements, a distinctive evaluation criteria system that differed from that of urban suitability was established by considering the level of rural infrastructure services as well as living and working conditions. The unpredictable mutual interference among evaluation factors has been found in practical works. An improved TOPSIS using Mahalanobis distance was applied to solve the unpredictable correlation among the criteria in a suitability evaluation. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses obtained via Monte Carlo simulation were performed to examine the robustness of the model. Daye, a resource-based city with rapid economic development, unsatisfied rural development, and geological environmental problems caused by mining, was used as a case study. Results indicate the following findings: 1) The RSSE model using the improved TOPSIS can assess the suitability of rural settlements, and the suitability maps generated using the improved TOPSIS have higher information density than those generated using traditional TOPSIS. The robustness of the model is improved, and the uncertainty is reduced in the suitability results. 2) Highly suitable land is mainly distributed in the northeast of the study area, and the majority of which is cultivated land, thereby leading to tremendous pressure on the loss of cultivated land. 3) Lastly, 12.54% of the constructive expansion permitted zone and 8.36% of the constructive expansion conditionally permitted zone are situated in an unsuitable area, which indicates that the general planning of Daye lacks the necessary verification of suitability evaluation.

      " Abstract: Solanum elaeagnifolium Cavanilles (Solanaceae), an exotic weed of arable and pastoral lands in South Africa, has been difficult to control by mechanical and herbicidal methods. Biological control, within an integrated management framework, may provide a solution. Specificity tests on two defoliating beetles, Leptinotarsa texana (Schaeffer) and Leptinotarsa defecta (Stål) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), showed that both species have narrow host ranges on Solanum species and are unable to survive on plants outside that genus. In cages, most solanaceous crops, including potato, tomato, green pepper, tobacco, and cape gooseberry (groundcherry), were not attacked. However, both beetle species developed on cultivated eggplant and on five native South African Solanum species. Starvation tests indicated that there was no consistent loss of fitness on these plants relative to S. elaeagnifolium. Although choice tests in small cages were inconclusive, tests in walk-in cages revealed that the beetles have strong oviposition preferences for S. elaeagnifolium. In spite of these ambiguous results, further investigation suggested that the results of the cage tests had been overemphasized. Both Leptinotarsa species were eventually cleared for release in South Africa in 1992, some 7 years after screening tests began. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Price is an important guideline for measuring the changes in the oil market. Therefore, the forecasting of oil prices has become an important issue in oil market research. One of the problems, however, is that oil price is a non-linear or chaotic time-series, leading to difficulties in such research. In the forecasting methods commonly used, pattern matching model is a good method because of its simplicity, non-linearity, and accuracy, but when calculating its important input parameters, pattern matching model encounters certain problems in terms of accuracy and stability. In this case, the accuracy of the model prediction results will be affected. In this paper, the loss function is used to detect the source of the complexity of oil price forecast. On the basis of generalised pattern matching model based on genetic algorithm (GPGA), we introduce empirical distribution into genetic algorithm, which can dynamically compare the fitness among populations and tracks changes in individual evolutionary fitness to improve multiple modules. By using these information, directional evolution and full search elements are ensured. Finally, a generalised pattern matching model based on empirical genetic algorithm (GPEGA) is proposed. Empirical studies show that the accuracy and stability of GPEGA are 59.0% and 0.8% higher than that of GPGA. Moreover, the performance is 71.2% and 72.2% better than that of BPNN and ARIMA on mean square error.

How should portfolio managers choose among the large number of covariance forecasting models available? We find that covariance matrix forecasts generated by models incorporating interest-rate level volatility effects perform best with respect to statistical loss functions. However, within a value-at-risk (VaR) framework, the relative performance of the covariance matrix forecasts depends greatly on the VaR distributional assumption, and forecasts based just on weighted averages of past observations perform best. In addition, portfolio variance forecasts that ignore the covariance matrix generate the lowest regulatory capital charge, a key economic decision variable for commercial banks. Our results provide empirical support for the commonly used VaR models based on simple covariance matrix forecasts and distributional assumptions. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In crustaceans with compound eyes, the corneal lens of each facet is part of the exoskeleton and thus shed during molting. Here we used an optomotor assay to evaluate the impact of molting on visual acuity (as measured by the minimum resolvable angle, min) in the female blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. We found that visual acuity decreases substantially in the days prior to molting and is gradually recovered after molting. Four days prior to molting, αmin was 1.8.deg (N=5), a value approximating the best possible acuity in this species. In the 24.h before ecdysis occurred, αmin increased to 15.0.deg (N=12), corresponding to an eightfold drop in visual acuity. Within 6.days after molting, αmin returned to the pre-molting value. Micrographs of C. sapidus eyes showed that a gap between the corneal lens and the crystalline cone first appeared approximately 5.days prior to shedding and increased in width as the process progressed. This separation was likely responsible for the loss of visual acuity observed in behavioral tests. In blue crabs, mating is limited to the period of the female's pubertal molt, and a reduction in acuity during this time may have an effect on the sensory cues used in female mate choice. The results described here may be broadly applicable to all arthropods that molt and have particular importance for crustaceans that molt multiple times in their lifetime or have mating cycles that are paired with molting. © 2011.

The gold standard in the diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LC) is the detection of malignant cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology. A 58-year-old woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer 2 years ago underwent lumbar puncture and CSF cytology in recent months due to new weakness, loss of strength in the lower extremities, and speech disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging CNS was simultaneously visualized and linear leptomeningeal enhancement was demonstrated. CSF cytology showed tumor cells as isolated cells or small clusters of tumor cells with large, partially vacuolated, and abundant cytoplasm, mostly with centrally located nuclei. Given her history of high-grade clear cell ovarian cancer,CSF cytology was positive for malignant cells and a diagnosis of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was made by the neuro-oncology multidisciplinary tumor board. Since LM also implies a systemic disease, the prognosis is very poor, CSF cytology will play an important role in rapid diagnosis and will be useful both in the right choice of treatment and in the early initiation of palliative care. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Research has revealed the impacts of climate change on the hydrologic cycle. These impacts are intensified in the urban water system due to special characteristics of urban watersheds, such as a high percentage of impervious areas and the presence of a microclimate. A slight change in rainfall intensity and duration can cause severe floods, with a significant incremental increase in life and property losses. Therefore, it is a key issue to modify the urban watershed characteristics in a systematic way to deal with these probable changes. In this paper, a multicriteria optimization model is developed to select best management practices (BMPs) for flood management in urban watershed systems. The addressed criteria include maximizing reliability of the drainage system, as well as minimizing flood damages and BMP costs. A new reliability index for dealing with floods is suggested in this study that considers both severity and duration of flooding. The optimization model is solved using a two-stage multicriteria decision making method which employs the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) for the selection of best alternatives. The performance of the suggested model is tested in an urban watershed located in the northeastern part of Tehran, the capital of Iran. The drainage system of this watershed is simulated using the storm water management model (SWMM) developed by United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The climate characteristics of this region are simulated under a climate change scenario based on Hadley Center Coupled Model, version 3 General Circulation Model (HadCM3 GCM) outputs. The rainfall events, with flooding potential, are determined and the optimization model is used to select the best BMPs for flooding conditions. The results show the important value of using the proposed algorithm for reducing flooding volume and increasing the drainage system's reliability. The results show further investigations are needed for real case applications to incorporate the uncertainties in climate change impacts. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: Obesity-related problems can now be managed with effective nutritional therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgeries that achieve >10% weight loss. Assessing patient preferences, treatment choices, and factors affecting patients can improve treatment compliance and efficacy. Our aim was to identify factors affecting patient preference and subsequent choice of pharmacotherapy among those seeking treatment for obesity-related disorders. Methods: A participatory action study using purposeful sampling recruited 33 patients with obesity complications. They were referred to specialist clinics in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Sixteen males and seventeen females aged 18–70 years, with BMI > 35 kg/m2 were recruited. Before the interview, participants watched a 60-minute video explaining nutritional therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery in equipoise. Data were collected in semi-structured interviews; Reflective thematic analysis was used. This sub study focuses only on patients who expressed specific attitudes (positive or negative) towards pharmacotherapy. Results: Ten (30%) patients expressed a view on pharmacotherapy. Eight (24%) patients chose pharmacotherapy alone, whereas two (6%) patients chose pharmacotherapy combined with nutritional therapy. In this sub study focusing on pharmacotherapy, five themes were identified related to choosing whether or not to take medication: (1) attitudes towards pharmacotherapy, (2) attitudes toward size of obesity and its complications, (3) weighing the benefits and risks of treatment, (4) knowledge and reassurance of health professionals, and (5) costs associated with drug therapy. Conclusion: The primary concerns regarding pharmacotherapy for intentional weight loss were efficacy, side effects, lifelong dosing, pharmacokinetics, and cost. Providing access to information about all the pharmacotherapies and the benefits is likely to result in greater penetrance of treatment. © The Author(s) 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

The optimal asset allocation is defined so that it minimizes the expected loss of the pensioner as measured by the performance of the pension fund against a benchmark. Two benchmarks are considered: a risk-free investment and the price of an annuity. The fair-value income drawdown rate is defined so that the fund performance is a martingale under the objective measure. Annuitization is recommended if the expected fair-value drawdown rate falls below the annuity rate available at retirement. As an illustration, the annuitization age is calculated for a Gompertz mortality distribution function and a power law loss function. © The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2008.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Financial success under medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) will require meaningful changes in the way hospitals are managed. Such management changes will require new approaches to collecting, evaluating and using financial and medical information in the decision-making process. The basic response of hospital management to PPS has six components. They are: · Improve the quality of medical records · Determine profit and loss by DRG · Develop departmental and physician profiles · Develop and integrated database to monitor utilization patterns and departmental efficiencies · Initiate an aggressive utilization review program · Initiate product-line planning. Successfully implementing these six components will improve a hospital's ability to respond to the incentives inherent in PPS. This article examines in detail each of these components with an emphasis on practical, action-oriented steps that a hospital can undertake.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Trust in autonomous vehicles (AV) is of critical importance and demands comprehensive interdisciplinary research. While most studies utilize subjective measures, we employ electroencephalography (EEG) to study in a more objective manner the cognitive states associated with trust during AV driving. Subjects drove a simulated AV in Conditional Automation Driving (SAE L3) and Full Automation Driving (SAE L5) modes. In the experimental design, malfunctions were induced at both automation levels. Self-reported trust in the AV was reduced immediately after Full Automation malfunctions, but not after Conditional Automation malfunctions when subjects were able to take over vehicle control to avoid danger. EEG analyses reveal that during Full Automation malfunctions, there was a significant enhancement in approach motivation (i.e. desire to re-engage) and a disruption of right frontal functional clustering that supports executive cognition (i.e. planning and decision-making). No neurocognitive disruptions were observed during Conditional Automation malfunctions. Our results demonstrate that it is not automation malfunctions per se (e.g. failure to decelerate) that deteriorate trust, but rather the inability for human drivers to adaptively mitigate the risk of negative outcomes (e.g. risk of crashing) resulting from those malfunctions. This is reflected in changes in brain activity associated with motivational state and action planning. Keeping the human driver on-the-loop protects against trust loss. Frontal alpha EEG is a neural correlate of trust-in-automation, with potential for trust monitoring using wearable technology to support driver-vehicle adaptivity.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Cybersecurity is one of the great challenges of today’s world. Rapid technological development has allowed society to prosper and improve the quality of life and the world is more dependent on new technologies. Managing security risks quickly and effectively, preventing, identifying, or mitigating them is a great challenge. The appearance of new attacks, and with more frequency, requires a constant update of threat detection methods. Traditional signature-based techniques are effective for known attacks, but they are not able to detect a new attack. For this reason, intrusion detection systems (IDS) that apply machine learning (ML) techniques represent an alternative that is gaining importance today. In this work, we have analyzed different machine learning techniques to determine which ones permit to obtain the best traffic classification results based on classification performance measurements and execution times, which is decisive for further real-time deployments. The CICIDS2017 dataset was selected in this work since it contains bidirectional traffic flows (derived from traffic captures) that include benign traffic and different types of up-to-date attacks. Each traffic flow is characterized by a set of connection-related attributes that can be used to model the traffic and distinguish between attacks and normal flows. The CICIDS2017 also contains the raw network traffic captures collected during the dataset creation in a packet-based format, thus permitting to extract the traffic flows from them. Various classification techniques have been evaluated using the Weka software: naive Bayes, logistic, multilayer perceptron, sequential minimal optimization, k-nearest neighbors, adaptive boosting, OneR, J48, PART, and random forest. As a general result, methods based on decision trees (PART, J48, and random forest) have turned out to be the most efficient with F1 values above 0.999 (average obtained in the complete dataset). Moreover, multiclass classification (distinguishing between different types of attack) and binary classification (distinguishing only between normal traffic and attack) have been compared, and the effect of reducing the number of attributes using the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) technique has been evaluated. By reducing the complexity in binary classification, better results can be obtained, and by selecting a reduced set of the most relevant attributes, less time is required (above 30% of decrease in the time required to test the model) at the cost of a small performance loss. The tree-based techniques with CFS attribute selection (six attributes selected) reached F1 values above 0.990 in the complete dataset. Finally, a conventional tool like Zeek has been used to process the raw traffic captures to identify the traffic flows and to obtain a reduced set of attributes from these flows. The classification results obtained using tree-based techniques (with 14 Zeek-based attributes) were also very high, with F1 above 0.997 (average obtained in the complete dataset) and low execution times (allowing several hundred thousand flows/s to be processed). These classification results obtained on the CICIDS2017 dataset allow us to affirm that the tree-based machine learning techniques may be appropriate in the flow-based intrusion detection problem and that algorithms, such as PART or J48, may offer a faster alternative solution to the RF technique. © 2022 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Software Product Line (SPL) is an effective approach in software reuse in which core assets can be shared among the members of the product line with an explicit treatment of variability. Core assets, which are developed for reuse in domain engineering, are selected for product specific derivation in application engineering. Decision making support during product derivation is crucial to assist in making multiple decisions during product specific derivation. Multiple decisions are to be resolved at the architectural level as well as the detailed design level, address the need for assisting the decision making process during core asset derivation. Architectural level decision making is based on imprecise, uncertain and subjective nature of stakeholder for making architectural selection based on non- functional requirements (NFR). Furthermore, detail design level involves the selection of suitable features which have the rationale behind each decision. The rationale for the selection, if not documented properly, will also result in loss of tacit knowledge. Therefore, a multi-attribute architecture design decision technique is proposed to overcome the above mentioned problem. The technique combines Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with lightweight architecture design decision documentation to support the decision making during core asset derivation. We demonstrate our approach using the case study of Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). The case study implementation shows showed that the proposed technique supports software engineer in the process of decision making at the architecture and detail design levels. © 2015 Penerbit UTM Press.

      " Abstract: IMPORTANCE Regular surveillance of individuals at high risk for cutaneous melanoma improves early detection and reduces unnecessary excisions; however, a cost analysis of this specialized service has not been undertaken. OBJECTIVE To determine the mean cost per patient of surveillance in a high-risk clinic from the health service and societal perspectives. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used a bottom-up microcosting method to measure resource use in a consecutive sample of 102 patients treated in a high-risk hospital-based clinic in Australia during a 12-month period. EXPOSURE Surveillance and treatment of melanoma. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All surveillance and treatment procedures were identified through direct observation, review of medical records, and interviews with staff and were valued using scheduled fees from the Australian government. Societal costs included transportation and loss of productivity. RESULTS The mean number of clinic visits per year was 2.7 (95%CI, 2.5-2.8) for surveillance and 3.8 (95%CI, 3.4-4.1) for patients requiring surgical excisions. The mean annual cost per patient to the health system was A $882 (95%CI, A $783-$982) (US $599 [95%CI, US $532-$665]); the cost discounted across 20 years was A $11 546 (95%CI, A $10 263-$12 829) (US $7839 [95%CI, US $6969-$8710]). The mean annual societal cost per patient (excluding health system costs) was A $972 (95%CI, A $899-$1045) (US $660 [95%CI, US $611-$710]); the cost discounted across 20 years was A $12 721 (95%CI, A $12 554-$14 463) (US $8637 [95%CI, US $8523-$9820]). Diagnosis of melanoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer and frequent excisions for benign lesions in a relatively small number of patients was responsible for positively skewed health system costs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Microcosting techniques provide an accurate cost estimate for the provision of a specialized service. The high societal cost reflects the time that patients are willing to invest to attend the high-risk clinic. This alternative model of care for a high-risk population has relevance for decision making about health policy. Copyright © 2015 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective: To identify the attitudes toward long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) among schizophrenia at three psychiatric outpatient clinics in Southern Thailand from February to April 2021. Materials and Methods: A study was conducted at three psychiatric outpatient clinics. All patients, who met the criteria of having schizophrenia based on ICD-10 criteria, aged 20-60 years were included. The questionnaires utilized were:1) Demographic information, 2) Profile of schizophrenia disorder, and 3) Attitude, knowledge, and satisfaction towards LAIs. All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: There were 259 participants who completed the questionnaires. From the participants, 39% had a history of being treated with LAIs. A quarter of them felt LAIs made them feel stigmatized (26.3%), that they lost autonomy (24.7%), and embarrassed (16.6%). The reasons for refusing to receive LAIs were not fear of needles or pain at the injection site (49%), but rather that LAIs had more adverse effects than oral medications (47.9%). Half of them (51.8%) knew that they must continue to use LAIs, even though their symptoms had improved as LAIs played an important role by improving their symptoms (68.8%), and preventing relapse (51.8%). They were satisfied about having been involved in the decision making of using LAIs for their treatment (63.6%), having information on the risk-benefits from LAIs provided to them (72.3%), and the cost of LAIs (75.2%). Conclusion: Before deciding to prescribe LAIs, we should ensure that all patients receive information about the risks, and benefits of LAIs, boosting acceptance for this formulation and mitigating concerns about patient autonomy reduction and stigmatization © 2022.

      " Abstract: The food system is undergoing a digital transformation that connects local and global supply chains to address economic, environmental, and societal drivers. Digitalisation enables firms to meet sustainable development goals (SDGs), address climate change and the wider negative externalities of food production such as biodiversity loss, and diffuse pollution. Digitalising at the business and supply chain level through public–private mechanisms for data exchange affords the opportunity for greater collaboration, visualising, and measuring activities and their socio-environmental impact, demonstrating compliance with regulatory and market requirements and providing opportunity to capture current practice and future opportunities for process and product improvement. Herein we consider digitalisation as a tool to drive innovation and transition to a decarbonised food system. We consider that deep decarbonisation of the food system can only occur when trusted emissions data are exchanged across supply chains. This requires fusion of standardised emissions measurements within a supply chain data sharing framework. This framework, likely operating as a corporate entity, would provide the foci for measurement standards, data exchange, trusted, and certified data and as a multi-stakeholder body, including regulators, that would build trust and collaboration across supply chains. This approach provides a methodology for accurate and trusted emissions data to inform consumer choice and industrial response of individual firms within a supply chain.

      " Abstract: Background. Current patient education and informed consent regarding weight loss expectations for bariatric surgery candidates are largely based on averages from large patient cohorts. The variation in weight loss outcomes illustrates the need for establishing more realistic weight loss goals for individual patients. This study was designed to develop a simple web-based tool which provides patient-specific weight loss expectations. Methods. Postoperative weight measurements after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were collected and analyzed with patient characteristics known to influence weight loss outcomes. Quantile regression was used to create expected weight loss curves (25th, 50th, and 75th %tile) for the 24 months after RYGB. The resulting equations were validated and used to develop web-based tool for predicting weight loss outcomes. Results. Weight loss data from 2986 patients (2608 in the primary cohort and 378 in the validation cohort) were included. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) and age were found to have a high correlation with weight loss accomplishment (P < 0.0001 for each). An electronic tool was created that provides easy access to patient-specific, 24-month weight loss trajectories based on initial BMI and age. Conclusions. This validated, patient-centered electronic tool will assist patients and providers in patient teaching, informed consent, and postoperative weight loss management. © 2014 G.

      " Abstract: The effects of prior semantic context upon lexical access during sentence processing were examined for three groups of subjects: nonfluent agrammatic (Broca's) aphasic patients; fluent (Wernicke's) aphasic patients; and neurologically intact control patients. Subjects were asked to comprehend auditorily presented, structurally simple sentences containing lexical ambiguities, which were in a context strongly biased toward just one interpretation of that ambiguity. While listening to each sentence, subjects also had to perform a lexical decision task upon a visually presented letter string. For the fluent Wernicke's patients, as for the controls, lexical decisions for visual words related to each of the meanings of the ambiguity were facilitated. By contrast, agrammatic Broca's patients showed significant facilitation only for visual words related to the a priori most frequent interpretation of the ambiguity. On the basis of these data, we suggest that normal form-based word retrieval processes are crucially reliant upon the cortical tissue implicated in agrammatism, but that even the focal brain damage yielding agrammatism does not destroy the normally encapsulated form of word access. That is, we propose that in agrammatism, the modularity of word access during sentence comprehension is rendered less efficient but not lost. Additionally, we consider a number of broader issues involved in the use of pathological material to infer characteristics of the neurological organization of cognitive architecture.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: Vaccinia virus is a DNA poxvirus previously used as a vaccine to eradicate smallpox. The virus has a high efficiency of infection, replicates in the cytoplasm without chromosomal integration and can transport a large amount of recombinant DNA without losing infectivity. Therefore, it is an excellent choice as a vector for gene delivery in vivo. Large quantities of vaccinia have been injected into dermal, subcutaneous and peripheral lymph node melanoma metastases without significant side effects, and with efficient infection of the tumor cells and recombinant gene transfection. To determine if vaccinia, when given intravesically, can effectively infect bladder mucosa and tumor with acceptable toxicity, we performed a phase I trial of intravesical vaccinia in patients with muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma before radical cystectomy. Materials and Methods: After documenting immune competence and demonstration of a major reaction after revaccination, patients received 3 increasing doses of intravesical Dryvax vaccinia virus (Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) that was provided by the Centers for Disease Control. Approximately 24 hours after the third dose, cystectomy was performed and the tissue was examined microscopically. Results: There were 4 patients who were treated. The 3 patients who received the highest doses (100 × 106 plaque forming units) had significant mucosal and submucosal inflammatory infiltration by lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells into tumor and normal tissue. Dendritic cells were recruited to the site after exposure to the vaccinia. Significant mucosal edema and vascular ectasia were seen. Tumor and normal urothelial cells showed evidence of viral infection, including enlarged vacuolated cells with cytoplasmic inclusions. There were no clinical or laboratory manifestations of vaccinia related toxicity except mild dysuria. Of the 4 patients 3 survived and were free of disease at 4-year followup. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that vaccinia virus can be administered safely into the bladder with recruitment of lymphocytes and induction of a brisk local inflammatory response. To our knowledge, this is the first report of direct delivery of live virus into the human bladder. The role of wild type vaccinia as immunotherapy for bladder cancer warrants further study. Furthermore, these data support the exploration of recombinant vaccinia as a putative gene therapy vector for intravesical infection and transfection of bladder tumor cells with cytokine or other genes, an approach that our group pioneered and most recently studied in patients with superficial melanoma.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: With current technology prediction errors in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) are frequently greater than the estimated separation distance between objects undergoing conjunction. Current predictions are thus frequently false alarms, and real collisions have been missed resulting in expensive losses. The February 2009 collision between the active Iridium 33 and the inert Kosmos-2251 was predicted to have a miss distance of 584 metres, but this was less than the error, and so the prediction was ignored, and the actual collision and destruction of Iridium-33 came as a complete surprise. As well the inherent errors in existing ground-based measurements of spacecraft, a significant problem for satellite tracking and collision prediction is the lack of coverage of ground stations. Less than 20% of the Earth's surface area is suitable for siting ground stations [plus a limited number of isolated island sites]. For example, for BDS [a Chinese navsat system], inadequate ground stations and the poor distribution of the network have limited the accuracy of BDS orbit determination [1]. The increasing flux density of orbital objects is driving the community to improve orbital determination of all space objects, or as many as possible. Recently studies have determined that collision prediction accuracy can be greatly improved for spacecraft who carry on board GNSS transponders. We are developing a system using autonomous tracking devices (an application of our Pixie nanospacecraft) which are attached to a host satellite and communicate accurate location data autonomously of the main spacecraft. The data collected is sent to a central Earth station via an established satellite relay from the device. This intersatellite link is available continuously without regard to the position of the host satellite relative to the Earth's surface (e.g., whether it is over regions with no tracking stations). Consequently, positional and velocity data of the host satellite is available without gaps, allowing greatly improved knowledge of the orbital parameters and position of the host satellite versus existing methods. The attached device contains several sensors including a GPS or GNSS receiver, which allows determination of the host spacecraft position accurate to within 10 metres or better, compared with one kilometre (or worse) for conventional ground station methods. The improved knowledge of spacecraft position will allow greatly improved predictions of collisions between space objects, by orders of magnitude versus the existing technology, and yet is cheaper than the less accurate methods using ground stations. It is difficult to quantify the economic damage due to space object collisions since commercial operator might not publish all collision events, preferring to keep them confidential. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that economic impact can be severe. In addition, damage to the International Space Station is a major concern, it is the largest “target”. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to correctly identify the increasing number of satellites. There have been recent launches of multiple spacecraft on a single vehicle in which radio contact was not established with many of the objects, and hence it has become impossible to identify them. This is a concern for several reasons, including liability. Attaching Pixies will resolve this problem. Over time, the improvement in knowledge of space object position by installing the Pixie black boxes will reduce the number of collisions by improving positional knowledge accuracy and reducing the number of false alarms. Collision avoidance maneuvers can be planned and executed in a more controlled and reliable manner, reducing expenditure of propellant. Once Pixies have been successfully demonstrated then it is entirely possible that the international community could mandate the use of Pixie black boxes to be attached to all spacecraft, in a similar manner than Flight Data Recorders and Cockpit Voice Recorders are mandated on most passenger aircraft. The large quantity of new more accurate space object positional data generated will facilitate new methods for organizing large numbers of rapidly moving space objects. New algorithms will be developed to optimize multi-dimensional positional knowledge and situational awareness. Artificial intelligence would be appropriate to leverage the new data pool. Improved conjunction predictions will be facilitated, and probabilistic risk assessment methods should be applied to assist decision making, e.g. when to initiate collision avoidance maneuvers. Potentially this decision making could be automated. © 2020\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Application of a clinical decision rule for subarachnoid hemorrhage, in combination with cranial computed tomography (CT) performed within six hours of ictus (early cranial CT), may be able to reasonably exclude a diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). This study's objective was to examine the sensitivity of both early cranial CT and a previously validated clinical decision rule among emergency department (ED) patients with aSAH and a normal mental status. Methods: Patients were evaluated in the 21 EDs of an integrated health delivery system between January 2007 and June 2013. We identified by chart review a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed with aSAH in the setting of a normal mental status and performance of early cranial CT. Variables comprising the SAH clinical decision rule (age >40, presence of neck pain or stiffness, headache onset with exertion, loss of consciousness at headache onset) were abstracted from the chart and assessed for inter-rater reliability. Results: One hundred fifty-five patients with aSAH met study inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of early cranial CT was 95.5% (95% CI [90.9-98.2]). The sensitivity of the SAH clinical decision rule was also 95.5% (95% CI [90.9-98.2]). Since all false negative cases for each diagnostic modality were mutually independent, the combined use of both early cranial CT and the clinical decision rule improved sensitivity to 100% (95% CI [97.6-100.0]). Conclusion: Neither early cranial CT nor the SAH clinical decision rule demonstrated ideal sensitivity for aSAH in this retrospective cohort.

      " Abstract: In this paper we focus on the role institutions and structural parameters play in macroeconomic policy design and test the differential effects of tax policies on two structural parameters: the degree of international capital mobility and the rules of wage indexation practiced in the economy. We evaluate counterfactual changes in taxation in the Argentine economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Model with unemployment, calibrated with 2006 data, showing that policy mistakes (diagnosis failures) are costlier when the degree of capital mobility is greater and the rules to determine salaries could amplify the losses. Among other taxes, we evaluate the choice of export taxation, historically one of the preferred revenue sources of Argentine governments. We discuss the choice of taxes that an optimistic and a pessimistic policymaker will make under Knightian uncertainty and find that, in the case of our CGE, an optimistic policymaker prefers to tax export goods, while a more pessimistic one tends to tax imports or non-tradable goods. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Price experimentation is an important tool for firms to find the optimal selling price of their products. It should be conducted properly, since experimenting with selling prices can be costly. A firm, therefore, needs to find a pricing policy that optimally balances between learning the optimal price and gaining revenue. In this paper, we propose such a pricing policy, called controlled variance pricing (CVP). The key idea of the policy is to enhance the certainty equivalent pricing policy with a taboo interval around the average of previously chosen prices. The width of the taboo interval shrinks at an appropriate rate as the amount of data gathered gets large; this guarantees sufficient price dispersion. For a large class of demand models, we show that this procedure is strongly consistent, which means that eventually the value of the optimal price will be learned, and derive upper bounds on the regret, which is the expected amount of money lost due to not using the optimal price. Numerical tests indicate that CVP performs well on different demand models and time scales. © 2014 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The contemporary consumer's decision-making processes have been affected by two independent factors. Firstly, the difficult economic climate heightened their level of price sensitivity and, secondly, the emergence of online shopping provided them with a better means of information searching. These two factors have combined to produce new behaviours in the shopping process, involving purchasing across channels through show-rooming (viewing in store and buying online) and web-rooming (viewing online and buying in store). Using a quantitative methodology, this paper tested consumers' motivation and propensity to engage in 'show-rooming' and 'web-rooming'. It investigated their reasons for acceptance or avoidance of virtual and physical channels to identify the factors that promote cross-channel behaviour. The results indicated that 'show-rooming' behaviour prevailed when efficient price and product comparisons could not be conducted in physical channels; and 'web-rooming' was used when the consumer could not predict garment dimensions online. This demonstrates the need for retailers to acquire a deeper understanding of the information consumers require within each selling interface, with an aim to minimise the potential of lost sales that result when consumers switch to more proactive competitor brands. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Insulin therapy is effective, but its potential side effects, including excessive weight gain, can undermine treatment success through adverse physiological consequences and patient demotivation. Educational and practical steps can be taken and therapy choices made that can limit this problem. APNs, working closely with patients who have diabetes, with diabetes nurse educators and with dietitians, have a role to play in weight management. Education concerning medical nutritional therapy and physical activity contributes to the overall care of the patient and effective self-management of diabetes.

First, the choice of testing approach (time series versus cross-sectional) will deliver different sets of factors. Second, varying test portfolio sorts changes the importance of candidate factors. Finally, given the hundreds of factors that have been proposed, test multiplicity must be dealt with. We propose a new method that makes measured progress in addressing these key challenges. We apply our method in a panel regression setting and shed some light on the puzzling empirical result that the market factor drives the bulk of the variance of stock returns, but is often knocked out in cross-sectional tests. In our setup, the market factor is not eliminated. Further, we bypass arbitrary portfolio sorts and instead execute our tests on individual stocks with no loss in power. Finally, our bootstrap implementation, which allows us to impose the null hypothesis of no cross-sectional explanatory power, naturally controls for the multiple testing problem. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Development of a pelleted dry feed as an alternative to feeding fresh fishery by-catch is an environmental priority for tropical spiny lobster aquaculture. Earlier studies have shown the lobster's acceptance of pelleted dry feed diminishes rapidly after immersion in water. In this work, we quantified the rate at which dry matter, total protein, soluble protein and individual and total free amino acids were lost from pieces of green-lipped mussel Perna canaliculus, a commercially-extruded Penaeus japonicus (kuruma) shrimp feed (KSF) and four laboratory-made, fishmeal-based, pelleted feeds upon immersion for up to 7.5 h. The laboratory-made feeds contained homogenates of either green-lipped mussel, polychaete (Marphysa sanguinea), prawn (Metapenaeus bennettae) or squid (Sepioteuthis spp.). After being immersed in water for 0, 2.5 or 5 h, these same feeds were offered as a paired choice with KSF in two preference feeding studies with juvenile Panulirus ornatus lobsters. The loobster's preference for fresh mussel always exceeded that of KSF, irrespective of immersion time. Regression of the proportional intake of test feeds against the relative leach rate of KSF identified soluble protein, glycine and taurine as the principal leachate components having the highest positive correlations with the lobster's feeding preference. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Discoloration of the sapwood caused by blue-stain fungi on conifer logs during interim storage causes significant loss to the forest industry. The fungal infection is often associated with bark beetle attacks because the spores are transmitted by the beetles. They can also be disseminated by rain-splash and moist air. While there are methods to protect logs from sap-stain in wood yards, this is often not possible in the forest for practical and regulatory reasons. Timing of harvesting and timely transportation are often the only ways to prevent blue-stain. To estimate the urgency of transportation, knowledge of the growth of blue-stain fungi and its dependence on weather conditions is of great interest. The proportion of discolored sapwood on Norway spruce logs was recorded along a time series, together with weather data in two field experiments conducted in spring and summer at two alpine sites in Austria. A predictive model was developed to estimate the proportion of blue-stained sapwood based on the temperature sum to which the logs were exposed. After harvest in March, there was a time lag of 82 and 97 days at the two respective sites, caused by initially low temperatures, before discoloration started. In contrast, sap-stain occurred 14 days after the harvest in June, when warm conditions prevailed from the start. The nonlinear least square regression model can help to estimate a window of opportunity to transport wood before it loses its value and serves as a sub model for lead time estimation within logistic decision support systems. © 2023, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

Methods: This study incorporated a mixed-methods design. For the quantitative data it was choose an e-survey (with 25 close-end questions, plus general information of the study and a clinical vignette), retrieving sociodemographic and self-reported practice on knee osteoarthritis information. It was analysed response frequencies and associations between variables with logistic regression analyses. For the qualitative data, it was chosen to perform semi-structured interviews in purposefully selected physical therapists to include different sociodemographic factors and survey responses regarding the physical therapists’ interventions chosen. After the interviews, the audios were collected, anonymised, transcribed verbatim, and the texts explored by the thematic approach.

To address this issue, it's crucial to clarify the order of maintenance activities during the bridge maintenance process and the impact of maintenance resources on structural safety performance. This understanding allows for the precise establishment of a model that captures the changes in structural safety performance in relation to the bridge maintenance duration that are resource-constrained. This paper proposes a resource-constrained bridge maintenance optimization method where neither the structural safety performance loss nor the duration holds a dominant advantage. An Adjusted NSGA-II (Adj-NSGA-II) method is employed to determine the total structural safety performance loss and total duration throughout the bridge's operational cycle. The results show that the number of construction workers in the mathematical model proposed will have different degrees of influence on the change of the total construction duration under the similar total structural safety performance.

      " Abstract: The development of various heuristics has enabled optimization in simulation environments. Nevertheless, this research area remains underexplored, primarily with respect to the time required for convergence of these heuristics. In this sense, simulation optimization is influenced by the complexity of the simulation model, the number of variables, and by their ranges of variation. Within this context, this paper proposes a method capable of identifying the best ranges for each integer decision variable within the simulation optimization problem, thereby providing a reduction in computational cost without loss of the quality in the response. The proposed method combines experimental design techniques, Discrete Event Simulation, and Data Envelopment Analysis. The experimental designs called orthogonal arrays are used to generate the input scenarios to be simulated, and super-efficiency analysis is applied in a Data Envelopment Analysis model with variable returns to scale to rank the input scenarios. The use of the super-efficiency concept enables to distinguish the most efficient input scenarios, which allows for the ranking of all the orthogonal array scenarios used. The values of the variables of the two input scenarios that present the highest values of super-efficiency are adopted as the new range of the optimization problem. To illustrate this method's use and advantages, it was applied to real cases associated with integer simulation optimization problems. Based on the results, the effectiveness of this approach is verified because it delivered considerable reductions in the search space and in the computational time required to obtain a solution without affecting the quality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

Using a panel data set consisting of all states with legal commercial casino gambling from 1998 to 2009, a 2SLS fixed-effect model that also uses aggregate and sin-based excise taxes as instruments is estimated. We find that maximum casino tax rates negatively affect casino employment with an inelastic average effect of -0.6. We estimate state tax revenue changes per employee from a 1% increase in the gross gaming revenue tax, finding that states with comparatively low tax rates could increase public revenue with relatively small losses in employment. Nevada, New Jersey, and South Dakota - each with maximum tax rates currently below 10% - could increase tax revenue by more than $430,000 per estimated employee lost from the tax change.

      " Abstract: Considerable studies have examined and ascertained a significant number of male victims of domestic abuse, yet less is known about the social experiences of men who report their victimization. This study aims to explore the factors that interplay in the decisions of abused men to report, the sociocultural barriers to reporting abuse, and post-report social reactions toward victimized men. Fifty-two male victims of wife-initiated and perpetrated violence were engaged in a qualitative study, and an interpretative phenomenological analysis was carried out. Findings indicated a positive disposition of victims toward reporting but exhibited reluctance in reporting due to fear of social stigmatization, loss of sources of livelihood, and socio-religious statuses. Recognition of the predicaments of abused men in reporting and help-seeking processes is suggested, for their safety, coping, and wellbeing not to be compromised. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: To identify and assess the impact of various hazards threaten agriculture water supply systems, the development of a risk analysis framework is inevitable in promoting sustainable agricultural development. This study aims to develop a novel multi-hazard risk assessment model by applying a Hybrid Bayesian Network for agricultural water supply and distribution systems. This model consists of discrete and continuous nodes and their probable interactions. The structure of this model is designed to assess the risk associated with the agricultural water system's for supply and distribution sections separately considering various factors such as river discharge, the inflow of water distribution system and its fluctuation, and the demand of water. The developed model is applied to the Roodasht Irrigation district located in the center of Iran to demonestrate its capability. This Irrigation district is under the threat of drought, improper performance of the ditch-riders, and operational losses. The results showed that the model in both training and test datasets has proper accuracy and performance with the root mean square error of 0.069 and 0.076, coefficient of determinations equal to 0.717 and 0.690, and the overall index of model performance equal to 0.787 and 0.671, respectively. The results of this research and the proposed model will help stakeholders and decision-makers to be aware of the probable causes and the extent of system failure and its components due to the threatening hazards. Also, it will assist in planning the allocation of irrigation water based on predictable risk associated with various hazards. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: This paper examines and evaluates the content of news items reported in a sample of daily newspapers in China's biggest cities. Using three 'Western' media sources, an inventory of news items directly or indirectly related to the 'downside' of the economic reforms was generated. A simultaneous analysis of mainland newspapers finds that many of the same themes were reported, although the coverage tends to be thinner and less detailed. Some China scholars have suggested that the Party/state is losing control of the communications system in contemporary China, and the results of this study support such arguments; city-level newspapers are now publishing what is most interesting to their consumers and likely to win them a larger share of the market. The regime still manages the dissemination of sensitive political information, but the parallel dictates of commercialization result in the disorderly and unpredictable circulation of communications messages. Mainland newspapers still steer clear of stories considered too politically 'sensitive', but the margins of acceptability have been expanded to include news items that only a few years ago would have been excised. The state maintains control over what is included in the daily news as well as what is excluded, although it is unclear to what extent publishing decisions result from a process of state cooptation and self-censorship, as opposed to specific directives from Beijing.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Transmission of foodborne pathogens from ill food workers to diners in restaurants is an important cause of foodborne illness outbreaks. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends that food workers with vomiting or diarrhea (symptoms of foodborne illness) be excluded from work. To understand the experiences and characteristics of workers who work while ill, workplace interviews were conducted with 491 food workers from 391 randomly selected restaurants in nine states that participated in the Environmental Health Specialists Network of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 60% of workers recalled working while ill at some time. Twenty percent of workers said that they had worked while ill with vomiting or diarrhea for at least one shift in the previous year. Factors significantly related to workers having said that they had worked while ill with vomiting or diarrhea were worker sex, job responsibilities, years of work experience, concerns about leaving coworkers short staffed, and concerns about job loss. These findings suggest that the decision to work while ill with vomiting or diarrhea is complex and multifactorial.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In search for faster and more reliable communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) in conjuction with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) are subject of extensive research. In spatial multiplexing transmission an instantaneous rise of data rates governed by the number of transmit antennas can be realised. The system performance depends highly on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINR) at the receiver. The receiver's equaliser is supposed to maximize the SINR by mitigating the spatial interference and thus separating the transmitted signals. For this problem several solutions exist such as linear and nonlinear, per subcarrier or OFDM symbol-based. An overview of common algorithms is given and complexity is discussed. Bit error rate (BER) performance evaluations are presented. Another aspect is the impact of the equalisation strategy on the performance of bit-interleaved soft information-based channel coding schemes. As a representative, LDPC codes are chosen. Simulation results show a significant BER performance loss for symbol decision-based equalisers compared to the uncoded performance. To overcome this problem a modification of the Maximum Likelihood algorithm is proposed which yields good performance for low SNR applications. © 2010 Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objective. The cochlear implant is a neural prosthesis designed to directly stimulate auditory nerve fibers to induce the sensation of hearing in those experiencing severe-to-profound hearing loss. After surgical implantation, audiologists program the implant’s external processor with settings intended to produce optimal hearing outcomes. The likelihood of achieving optimal outcomes increases when audiologists have access to tools that objectively present information related to the patient’s own anatomy and surgical outcomes. This includes visualizations like the one presented here, termed the activation region overlap image, which is designed to decrease subjectivity when determining amounts of overlapping stimulation between implant electrodes. Approach. This visualization uses estimates of electric field strength to indicate spread of neural excitation due to each electrode. Unlike prior visualizations, this method explicitly defines regions of nerves receiving substantial stimulation from each electrode to help clinicians assess the presence of significant overlapping stimulation. A multi-reviewer study compared this and an existing technique on the consistency, efficiency, and optimality of plans generated from each method. Statistical significance was evaluated using the two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test. Main results. The study showed statistically significant improvements in consistency (p < 10-12), efficiency (p < 10−15), and optimality (p < 10−5) when generating plans using the proposed method versus the existing method. Significance. This visualization addresses subjectivity in assessing overlapping stimulation between implant electrodes, which currently relies on reviewer estimates. The results of the evaluation indicate the provision of such objective information during programming sessions would likely benefit clinicians in making programming decisions. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: It can be challenging to accurately determine the topography of physically complex landscapes in remote areas. Ground-based surveys can be difficult, time consuming and may miss significant elements of the landscape. This study compares digital elevation models (DEMs) generated from three different data sources, of the physically complex Narran Lakes Ecosystem, a major floodplain wetland ecosystem in Australia. Topographic surfaces were generated from an airborne laser altimetry (LiDAR) survey, a ground-based differential GPS (DGPS) survey containing more than 20,000 points, and the 9″ DEM of Australia. The LiDAR- and DGPS-derived data generated a more thorough DEM than the 9″ DEM; however, LiDAR generated a surface topography that yielded significantly more detail than the DGPS survey, with no noticeable loss of elevational accuracy. Both the LiDAR- and the DGPS-derived DEMs compute the overall surface area and volume of the largest floodplain lake within the system to within 1% of each other. LiDAR is shown to be a highly accurate and robust technique for acquiring large quantities of topographic data, even in locations that are unsuitable for ground surveying and where the overall landscape is of exceptionally low relief. The results of this study highlight the potential for LiDAR surveys in the accurate determination of the topography of floodplain wetlands.

      " Abstract: This article explores efforts to apply economic logic to human life. To do so, it looks at federal regulatory agencies, where government planners and policy makers have spent over a century trying to devise a scientifically sound way to measure the economic value of lives lost or saved by public programs. The methods they have drawn on, however, have changed drastically in the past 40 years, shifting from a ‘human capital’ approach based on models of economic productivity and producing relatively low dollar values to a ‘willingness-to-pay’ approach reflecting consumer choice and producing much higher values. Why, in an era of intense deregulatory pressures, did the valuation model that produced significantly higher estimates – making it easier to justify costly regulation – ultimately win out? This unlikely transition follows a shift in the nature of professional expertise dominating the federal bureaucracy during the 1970s and 1980s, as changing conceptions of health and safety regulation during this period gave academic economists the opportunity to make new claims about the exclusive authority of microeconomic theory for understanding the economic value of life in federal planning. Supporting this argument is a comparative case, the largely unsuccessful attempt to extend the willingness-to-pay model to the valuation of life in the courtroom. Pricing human life thus results not only from the renegotiation of moral boundaries around the economic logic of the market, but also from the reorganization of expert authority and the consolidation of scientific expertise around both the meaning and the measurement of value. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.\u001b[0m :\n",

Nursing should address the patient's response to vision-conserving treatment and their adaptation to decreased peripheral vision. Computerized Humphrey's Central 30/Peripheral 30-60 visual fields were performed on ten patients (all with greater than ten year follow-up) who were successfully treated for retinoblastoma. All ten visual fields revealed an absolute and relative scotoma in the affected eye. Visual field loss was always worse than one would have predicted based upon the fundus examination of the tumor(s). Decisions for treatment must be based upon an interdisciplinary approach of nursing and medicine to evaluate patient survival and visual outcome.

      " Abstract: Cross-efficiency evaluation is an extended form of DEA evaluation. The main difference from other models is that the evaluation of cross-efficiency takes the self-evaluation value and other evaluation values as the final efficiency score, and then ranks the decision-making units (DMUs). However, the traditional cross-efficiency model cannot guarantee the uniqueness of input weights and output weights, and the final result does not reach Pareto optimal. Also, the simple average aggregation of cross-efficiency values ignores the relative weight of DMUs and loses a lot of decision-making information, which leads to the lack of credibility of the results. Considering the decision information carried by the data and the weight of the decision-makers (DMs), this paper proposes an aggregate method of interval cross-efficiency matrix to realize the relative efficiency evaluation and the accurate ranking of the DMUs. In which DMUs are regarded as DMs, and then the relative weights of DMUs are determined by using the method of Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), and the relative advantage scores are obtained by considering the risk attitude of decision-makers based on the principle of the improved TODIM method. Finally, a numerical example is used to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, and the stability of the proposed method is verified by changing the value of θ. Compared with the simple average aggregation method of cross-efficiency values, the proposed method is more reasonable and feasible. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

Policies on flaring must weigh prospective losses against any gains in environmental protection and saved gas. A decision to prevent flaring would have to be based on the conclusion that the environmental benefits outweigh the economic costs of delayed oil production. Operators decide to flare gas when doing so enables them to generate the more-valuable crude stream until equipment is installed to capture associated gas. Millions of dollars have been deployed for natural gas infrastructure, and large outlays are expected over the next several years. Despite the large growth in gas capturing, gathering capacity has failed to prevent flaring. Regulations in North Dakota allow companies to flare gas from an oil well for up to 1 year before being forced to shut in the well, pay royalties, or connect gas output to gathering lines and facilities so it can be used for on-site power or sold.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Interviews were carried out amongst a cohort of 488 parents who lived as subsistence farmers in a remote and very poorly resourced region of South Africa. The majority of respondents had invested heavily in the education of their children, contrary to what might have been predicted from large family sizes and the economic and ecological pressures that families faced. There was little evidence of child specialization, in which educational investment might have been targeted more to some children than others in a family. However, relatively wide birth spacing may have made the financial and opportunity costs of schooling more manageable. This speculation is given some support by two findings: first, that the number of grades of schooling children complete before leaving increases significantly as birth spacing increases; second, that children who are still in school progress more rapidly as birth interval increases. Greater opportunities for the schooling of sons (made possible by low rates of migrant labour in the community), coupled with high opportunity costs associated with the schooling of daughters, made it likely that sons would be educated to a higher level than daughters. However, there was consistent evidence for gender equity in schooling patterns. This is attributed to the lower risk of financial and opportunity losses that are associated with rearing daughters in this particular community. Birth order exerted only modest effects on the decisions parents made about schooling their offspring. The investment strategy as a whole could be interpreted as \"bet-hedging\" under conditions where events outside parental control prevented them from targeting investment to children who could be readily identified as having favourable educational and employment prospects. It is concluded that parents invest in their sons and daughters in a manner that can only be understood when the complexities of their particular social, economic, and ecological contexts are taken into account.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The most frequent factors contributing to newborn mortality include prematurity and low birth weight. Prematurity has been linked to a number of well-known reasons, including maternal health, intrauterine infections, uteroplacental insufficiency, and psychosocial causes. The period of pregnancy is important for parental decision-making. Here, we report an intriguing, unique example of poor judgment and irrational reasoning that resulted in the birth of twins who were severely preterm and underweight. The couple when conceived spontaneously gave birth to a healthy baby, and then, they donated the baby to the elder brother under social and cultural pressure. The couple thought that they would not be able to take care of a baby and finally decided not to have any kids. Once more, they changed their minds and went for the pregnancy. However, they later decided to terminate the baby and finally chose a tubectomy. After a while, they decided they wanted to start a family again and underwent tubal recanalization. She chose in vitro fertilization (IVF) since she was unable to conceive naturally. Twins of gestational age 28-30 weeks were born through an emergency cesarean section after spending a lot of money. Both the babies required surfactant, ventilation, and intensive care for a long period due to their severe prematurity. Despite our best efforts and good nursing care, we still lost both the babies. The death of any baby in a hospital may be a mental trauma for the parents as well as health professionals. This case report is all about how wrong decision-making in the antenatal period regarding child adoption, donation of children, abortion, family planning, recanalization, and IVF treatment leads to birth of extremely low birth weight and severely premature babies. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

This switch is from continued modeling and diagnoses of biogeochemical conditions in favor of enhanced efforts to understand the many socio-political obstacles to achieving just transformations towards sustainability, and how to overcome them. We discuss why this shift continues to prove elusive. We argue that rarely analyzed mutually reinforcing power structures, interests, needs, and norms within the institutions of global environmental change science obstruct rethinking and reform. The blockage created by these countervailing forces are shielded from scrutiny and change through retreats behind shields of neutrality and objectivity, stoked and legitimated by fears of losing scientific authority. These responses are maladaptive, however, since transparency and reflexivity are essential for rethinking and reform, even in contexts marked by anti-environmentalism. We therefore urge greater openness, self-critique, and power-sharing across research communities, to create spaces and support for conversations, diverse knowledges, and decisions conducive to sustainability transformations. © 2021 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Behavioural approaches to weight loss are often initially successful but less so in the longer term, as some people maintain the necessary behaviour changes while others do not. This study aimed to derive possible explanations for this using a qualitative approach with a view to improving intervention effectiveness. Methods: Thirty-six participants in a development and feasibility study for a weight loss and maintenance intervention (called SkiM) were interviewed three times over 18 months regarding their experiences before, during and after the intervention. Data were analysed thematically. The accounts of those who were more and less successful in terms of longer term weight loss were compared, and a conceptual model linking the main analytic themes was developed. Results: Five interpretative themes were generated: encountering and managing key situations; the impact of emotion; the source of control; personal values; and acquiring knowledge and skills. These themes were linked through a model of decision-making during key situations. In this model, behavioural decisions emerge from a dynamic interplay between several drivers: emotional state and needs, perceived control, personal values, the individual's knowledge and skills, and their existing habits. The individual's response in key situations generates experiential learning that can influence decisional dynamics in similar situations in future. These dynamics appeared to differ between participants, and between those who were more and less successful in weight management. Conclusions: Our analysis and model of decision-making during weight-management have implications for the development and delivery of behavioural weight management interventions. By helping individuals to identify the drivers of their decision-making in key situations, and equipping them to manage these drivers, programmes may enhance their capacity to sustain the behaviour changes needed for long-term weight loss. © 2020 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose To elicit preference values for health states associated with Stage III colon cancer (CRC) and to explore the effect of neuropathy associated with current adjuvant treatment. Methods We used time trade-off (TTO) techniques to elicit preferences from 49 CRC patients and 49 community members. We elicited preferences for 7 health states: remission; adjuvant therapy with no, mild, moderate, and severe neuropathy; metastatic stable; and metastatic progressive disease. Mean TTO values were adjusted for the covariates age, education, and current health. Results Patients' adjusted mean TTO value for remission was 0.83; adjuvant chemotherapy health states ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. Significant differences were observed for both patient and community groups between TTO for remission and all adjuvant health states (P\\0.001), and between adjuvant therapy with no neuropathy and metastatic health states (P B 0.001). Across all health states, patients' values were on average 0.12 higher than community members (P\\0.05). Conclusions The findings highlight the trade-offs between the disutility of adjuvant treatment, the higher utility of remission, and the severe utility loss during metastatic disease.

The incidence of it is rising in Western countries due to immigration from Third World countries and human immunodeficiency virus infection. The difference between the simple closure and resection and anastomosis was evaluated in this study. Retrospectively, 12 patients with intestinal tuberculosis diagnosed histopathologically among 50 patients with free intestinal perforations operated on between 1995 and 2003 at Turgut Ozal Medical Center were evaluated. Each patient underwent routine laboratory tests and radiologic studies. The most common symptoms of patients were abdominal pain, night sweats, and weight loss. Sites of perforation were ileum in 10 patients (multiple perforation in 4) and jejunum in 2 patients (both had multiple perforations). The perforation was closed by primary closure in 7 patients. Resection-anastomosis was performed in 5 patients. Leaks occurred in overall 3 of 7 patients with primary closure. Three of the 7 patients with leaks due to septicemia died. The mortality rate among all patients was 25%. Intestinal tuberculosis should be kept in mind as a cause in free intestinal perforations.

      " Abstract: The aim of this study is to examine the Probabilistic Mental Model (PMM) Theory as an explanation of the framing effect in the context of reporting risk in different formats in Indonesia. The study was conducted using an online field experimental method with 3x4x2 mixed design, involving 54 investment analysts as participants. Experiments were conducted to test whether different formats of risk information-given the time sequence associated with the framing effect as explained by the PMM Theory-influence the investment decision-making process. The results show that participants chose to take action that is not at risk when the information presented is in a positive frame. Gains or a loss of information that accompanies the risk information does not affect participants' decision relating to investments they would do. The investment decisions tend to avoid risk. Decision makers in a positive frame risk conditions do not make decision that reduce the risk of gains they already have. When risk information is presented in a negative frame, the participants chose to make decisions that minimize losses that may arise as the results of an investment decision. Practical implication of this study is that the investor needs to respond to the framing effect because a similar problem with a different frame may result in a different choice. Investors need to be encouraged to improve the knowledge and reduce bias in decision-making caused by the presence of framing in a single set of accounting information.

How valence affects the impact of skewness on choice is unknown. Here by orthogonally manipulating the skewness and valence of economic stimuli we show that both have an influence on choice. We show that the influence of skewness on choice is independent of valence, both across and within subjects. fMRI data revealed skew-related activity in bilateral anterior insula and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, which shows no interaction with valence. Further, the expression of skew-related activity depends on an individual's preference for skewness, and this was again independent of valence-related preference. Our findings highlight the importance of skewness in choice and show that its influence, both behaviourally and neurally, is distinct from an influence of valence. © 2013 Wright et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) is a set with ordered consecutive linguistic terms, and is very useful in addressing the situations where people are hesitant in providing their linguistic assessments. Wang [H. Wang, Extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets and their aggregation in group decision making, International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems 8(1) (2015) 14-33.] removed the consecutive condition to introduce the notion of extended HFLTS (EHFLTS). The generalized form has wider applications in linguistic group decision-making. By introducing distance measures for EHFLTSs, in this paper we develop a novel multi-criteria group decision making model to deal with hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. The model collects group linguistic information by using EHFLTSs and avoids the possible loss of information. Moreover, it can assess the importance weights of criteria according to their subjective and objective information and rank alternatives based on the rationale of TOPSIS.

      " Abstract: On Michael Walzer's influential account, 'dirty hands' characterizes the political leader's choice between absolutist moral demands (to abstain from torture) and consequentialist political reasoning (to do what is necessary to prevent the loss of innocent lives). The impulse to torture a 'ticking bomb terrorist' is therefore at least partly pragmatic, straining against morality, while the desire to uphold a ban on torture is purely and properly a moral one. I challenge this 'Machiavellian' view by reinterpreting the dilemma in the framework of the Humean theory of justice and moral sentiment. By interpreting the ticking bomb scenario as a dramatic narrative, I argue that it appeals to properly moral sensibilities, which speak in favour of the use of force against the terrorist. The absolute ban on torture, by contrast, is an 'artificial virtue' and a product of political prudence. On this account, the ticking bomb terrorist dilemma therefore imposes a different burden on the political leader from Walzer's version: an ethic of political responsibility demands that the political leader be prepared to sacrifice her moral soul by upholding the law against moral but politically imprudent demands to break it; while the ticking bomb 'romance' appeals to her feelings of compassionate moral concern towards particular individuals. She dirties her hands morally, not by authorizing torture, but by allowing the terrorist's bomb to detonate and take the lives of the innocent. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

The concept of a periphery obviously raises the question of peripheral to what, while the term is often used in a relatively negative context with respect to levels of development and/or influence on central government decision-making. What the term does raise of course is the extent to which location still matters at a time when physical, virtual, capital and human mobility is supposedly greater than ever before. The four contributions therefore highlight a number of key points and debates surround the relative importance or, and relationship between, location and tourist movement. The lead piece by C. Michael Hall, from the Pacific periphery of the South Island of New Zealand, is charged with the topic of does tourism consume place and therefore lead to the loss of the periphery, and perhaps some of the very qualities that attracted tourists to it in the first place. The first response by David Harrison, also from the Pacific, looks at both the geographical and broader sodal scientific understandings of periphery. The second response from David Weaver utilizes the concept of experiential consumption to interrogate Hall's paper and also link to Harrison's reference to the importance of development theory in understanding notions of periphery.

Patients' behavioral performance on decision-making tasks such as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is characterized by selecting cards more frequently from disadvantageous than from advantageous decks, and by switching often between competing responses in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). In the present study, we developed a simple heuristic model to simulate individuals' choice behavior by varying the level of decision randomness and the importance given to gains and losses. The findings revealed that the model was able to differentiate the behavioral performance of patients with chronic pain and HCs at the group, as well as at the individual level. The best fit of the model in patients with chronic pain was yielded when decisions were not based on previous choices and when gains were considered more relevant than losses. By contrast, the best account of the available data in HCs was obtained when decisions were based on previous experiences and losses loomed larger than gains.

Understanding its cost improves decisions regarding resource allocation that may be directed towards treatment and cure, and guides the evaluation of clinical and community interventions designed to reduce the burden of disease.Methods: This research estimated direct and indirect costs of CFS and the impact on educational attainment using a population-based, case-control study between September 2004 and July 2005, Georgia, USA. Participants completed a clinical evaluation to confirm CFS, identify other illnesses, and report on socioeconomic factors. We estimated the effect of CFS on direct medical costs (inpatient hospitalizations, provider visits, prescription medication spending, other medical supplies and services) and loss in productivity (employment and earnings) with a stratified sample (n = 500) from metropolitan, urban, and rural Georgia. We adjusted medical costs and earnings for confounders (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and geographic strata) using econometric models and weighted estimates to reflect response-rate adjusted sampling rates.Results: Individuals with CFS had mean annual direct medical costs of $5,683. After adjusting for confounding factors, CFS accounted for $3,286 of these costs (p < 0.01), which were driven by increased provider visits and prescription medication use. Nearly one-quarter of these expenses were paid directly out-of pocket by those with CFS. Individuals with CFS reported mean annual household income of $23,076. After adjustment, CFS accounted for $8,554 annually in lost household earnings (p < 0.01). Lower educational attainment accounted for 19% of the reduction in earnings associated with CFS.Conclusions: Study results indicate that chronic fatigue syndrome may lead to substantial increases in healthcare costs and decreases in individual earnings. Studies have estimated up to 2.5% of non-elderly adults may suffer from CFS. In Georgia, a state with roughly 5.5 million people age 18-59, illness could account for $452 million in total healthcare expenditures and $1.2 billion of lost productivity. © 2011 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose: To assess the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with transvaginal extraction and impact of body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, previous surgery, and uterine fibroids. Patients and Methods: Five-port conventional laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with successful transvaginal extraction of the kidney was performed in 30 donors. The parameters assessed included age, BMI, operative time, estimated blood loss, warm ischemia time, postoperative pain score, preoperative and postoperative sexual function, wound complications, hospital stay, return to normal activities, recipient creatinine level, and other recipient-related complications. The data were compared with 30 female donors who had laparoscopic donor nephrectomy and transabdominal extraction. Results: The total number of patients who consented for the study was 38. In seven patients, an intraoperative decision to abort the transvaginal extraction was made because of obesity, pelvic adhesions, large uterine fibroids, and uterine artery injury. When compared with transabdominal extraction, there was no significant difference in warm ischemia time, mean operative time, estimated blood loss, hospital stay, recipient creatinine level, and complications. The mean pain score was significantly less on postoperative day 3 and day 4. There was also an earlier return to normal activities in the transvaginal group. There was no increase in infectious complication in both donors and recipient. Conclusion: Based on our initial experience with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with transvaginal extraction, we recommend this procedure for a premenopausal donor, with a BMI <30.

      " Abstract: Decision tree models are widely used for classification tasks in data mining. However, privacy becomes a significant concern when training data contain sensitive information from different parties. This paper proposes a novel framework for secure two-party decision tree classification that enables collaborative training and evaluation without leaking sensitive data. The critical techniques employed include homomorphic encryption, function secret sharing (FSS), and a custom secure comparison protocol. Homomorphic encryption allows computations on ciphertexts, enabling parties to evaluate an encrypted decision tree model jointly. FSS splits functions into secret shares to hide sensitive intermediate values. The comparison protocol leverages FSS to securely compare attribute values to node thresholds for tree traversal, reducing overhead through efficient cryptographic techniques. Our framework divides computation between two servers holding private data. A privacy-preserving protocol lets them jointly construct a decision tree classifier without revealing their respective inputs. The servers encrypt their data and exchange function secret shares to traverse the tree and obtain the classification result. Rigorous security proofs demonstrate that the protocol protects data confidentiality in a semihonest model. Experiments on benchmark datasets confirm that the approach achieves high accuracy with reasonable computation and communication costs. The techniques minimize accuracy loss and latency compared to prior protocols. Overall, the paper delivers an efficient, modular framework for practical two-party secure decision tree evaluation that advances the capability of privacy-preserving machine learning. © 2023 Kun Liu and Chunming Tang.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Collective decision-making plays a crucial role in information and communication systems. However, decision conflicts among agents often impede the maximization of potential utilities within the system. Quantum processes have shown promise in achieving conflict-free joint decisions between two agents through the entanglement of photons or the quantum interference of orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nonetheless, previous studies have shown symmetric resultant joint decisions, which, while preserving equality, fail to address disparities. In light of global challenges such as ethics and equity, it is imperative for decision-making systems to not only maintain existing equality but also address and resolve disparities. In this study, we investigate asymmetric collective decision-making theoretically and numerically using quantum interference of photons carrying OAM or entangled photons. We successfully demonstrate the realization of asymmetry; however, it should be noted that a certain degree of photon loss is inevitable in the proposed models. We also provide an analytical formulation for determining the available range of asymmetry and describe a method for obtaining the desired degree of asymmetry. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

Multi-level governance of policy sectors had already been strongly criticized when it was still restricted to Germany federalism. The arguments made then can today be repeated for the joint decision-making process of three levels of government: the European, the national and the regional.

      " Abstract: Symmetrical peripheral gangrene (SPG) is a complication of septicemia, characterized by progressive skin lesions, which can result in wide necrosis of all the extremities. Severe necrosis is often responsible of disfiguring consequences. It is important to limit the amputation and to provide a stable and functional soft tissue coverage of the stumps. Limited amputation and free flap reconstruction may help to prevent tissue loss and to provide an effective prosthetization and a prompt rehabilitation. We present a clinical case of a 60-year-old male admitted in our department for lower limbs necrosis due to SPG after a pneumococcal infection. The patient underwent bilateral forefeet amputation and microsur-gical reconstruction with antero-lateral thigh flap was performed on the left stump. Vascular complications determined a progressive necrosis of the flap and the failure of the reconstruction. A careful analysis of the local and systemic inflam-matory vascular and coagulative issues following the SPG has been performed to explain the failure of the microsurgery. Although the opinion of several authors is divided about the use of free tissue transfer, we believe that microsurgical reconstruction remains the first choice of treatment due to the reduced morbidity and early rehabilitation it provides. © 2020, Edizioni Luigi Pozzi.

Additionally related to his elective nephrectomy, he will experience the loss of his 12-year military career and associated benefits. Although the nursing interventions were instrumental in assisting A.J. and his wife to cope with his acute situation, they now face the fears and anxieties of lifetime chronic illness. Theoretically, this patient may have experienced chronic renal failure at some point in his life, but the nursing intervention could have been approached as a pre-ESRD patient, in lieu of his status as a postliving related donor patient.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The current knowledge on how different Eurasian perch rearing systems impact the final fillet quality is scant. Therefore, two domestic storage conditions were investigated—10 months frozen (−20◦C) and 12 days refrigerated (+4◦C) storage conditions—in order to determine (i) how the choice of rearing system affects fillets quality during different processing conditions and (ii) if oxidative changes and other quality parameters were interactive. For the proposed idea, proteome analysis, oxidative changes, and some quality parameters were considered in this study. Sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated a higher loss of protein in the frozen fillets from ponds (PF) than the fillets from recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) (RF). Western blot showed a higher protein carbonyls level in RF compared to PF, which was confirmed by the total protein carbonyls during frozen storage. PF indicated less liquid loss, hardness, and oxidation progress than RF in both storage conditions. The biogenic amines index (BAI) in the fillets from either origin showed acceptable levels during storage at +4◦C. Furthermore, the n-3/n-6 ratio was similar for both fillets. The deterioration of fillets during frozen storage was mainly caused by formation of ice crystals followed by protein oxidation, while protein oxidation was the main concern during refrigerated storage confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA) analysis. © 2021 by the authors.

      " Abstract: AIM: The purpose of this study was to present an intrasurgical decision making in teeth showing clinical signs and symptoms of incomplete vertical root fracture. METHODS: Sixteen patients with one tooth in which an incomplete vertical root fracture was diagnosed, involving only the buccal side, underwent a flap elevation procedure to visualize the pattern of bone loss and assess the type of root fracture. If the intraoperative diagnosis confirmed the presurgical one, a new root fracture repair technique was used. If the intraoperative diagnosis consisted of a complete or multiple fracture, the tooth was extracted and a postextraction implant insertion procedure was performed, in combination with the use of plasma rich in growth factors in order to enhance implant osseointegration. RESULTS: A total of nine vertical root fracture repair procedures were performed. The mean patient follow-up was 22.5 months. All patients reported full satisfaction for mastication function and phonetics. One patient was not satisfied for the esthetic result. A total of seven implants were immediately inserted in fresh postextraction sockets, and loaded four months later. The mean patient follow-up was 25.2 months. Overall implant success and survival was 100% after one year of functional loading. All patients reported full satisfaction for mastication function, phonetics and esthetics.

      " Abstract: Due to the increase of amorphous silica solubility as significant silicate ion forms in the pH range 7 to 8.5, the potential for the deposition of silica scale during reticulation (pipeline transmission) of waste geothermal waters to disposal sites is dependent on steam separation temperature, silica concentration and the pH of the residual fluid. For low salinity geothermal fluids the latter is related to the composition of the fluid, particularly the concentration of carbon dioxide remaining after the removal of steam for power generation using conventional separators. In general terms the higher the gas content of the initial deep aquifer fluid, the higher will be the pH of the waste waters, so that in many fields, where reservoir temperatures fall in the range 250 to 280°C, careful choice of separation pressures to maximise gas removal and hence elevate the pH of residual waters may obviate the problems of silica deposition, or the need to install costly chemical treatments such as acid or alkali addition. In designing and operating separators or flash plants it is important to avoid carryover of steam (containing CO2 and H2S) into the water reticulation lines, where, after heat loss, condensation occurs with resultant lower pH and higher scaling potential. Where flash plants are designed to receive a mixture of the two-phase discharges from a number of wells, consideration of the pH of the residual water resulting from steam separation may provide design constraints on the reticulation network such that silica scaling potential is minimised or entirely avoided. The Wairakei and Broadlands (Ohaaki) fields are used as examples of these design considerations in relation to the reservoir chemistry of the field and possible changes during extensive exploitation. © 1983.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Defects are driven by quality and a threat to the safety and utility of consumers. In recent years, consumers and supply chain enterprises have obtained increasing attention in product quality safety. However, product safety events caused by quality defects have still occurred frequently. For example, in 2008, Sanlu suffered a total loss of more than 900 million yuan for recalling tainted milk powder and compensating consumers′ loss, making Sanlu go bankrupt. In 2010, Toyota spent nearly 13. 5 billion yuan recalling almost 8 million vehicles due to the suppliers′ accelerator pedals problems. In 2020, GE recalled more than 7 million vehicles worldwide because of the unsafe airbags made by its supplier Takata and undertook a total of 1. 2 billion dollars in recall costs. These product quality safety events reveal that the downstream focal enterprises of the supply chains undertook most of the liability costs by the upstream defective products. Therefore, as the first responsible person, a downstream core enterprise in supply chains has a strong incentive to motivate the upstream manufacturer to improve its quality level of products. However, it can be easily found that the upstream manufacturer, as a follower, usually does not have enough capital to invest in the quality improvement activity. On the other hand, although the quality level can be improved by the upstream manufacturer′s quality investment, leading to an increase in the consumers′ market demand, the manufacturer still gains less from the incremental profit than the downstream core enterprise because of its weak position in the bargaining process between supply chain members. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how to design quality incentive strategies to improve the manufacturer′s quality level in the setting where the quality deficiencies of the manufacturer′ s products cause harm to the consumers and further lead the retailer to bear product liability. So far, most studies of supply chain management have investigated the issue of using coordination contracts to improve the quality level of products and profitability of the entire supply chain. However, studies on the liability cost caused by the upstream manufacturers′ quality defects that damage the consumers and are undertaken by the downstream retailers are still limited. Meanwhile, few studies have compared the effects of different quality incentive strategies and different decision types of the quality incentive strategy in a downstream retailer-dominated supply chain. Based on this, this study establishes a retailer-dominated supply chain game model with an ex-ante quality cost-sharing contract and an ex-post revenue-sharing contract. Both the cost-sharing rate and the revenue-sharing rate can be decided by the retailer alone or by the manufacturer and the retailer through Nash bargaining. First, given the quality incentive contracts exogenously, this study compares the results of the decentralised model and quality incentive models. It investigates whether the quality incentive strategies benefit the manufacturer′s quality improvement. Second, under the scenarios that the quality incentive contracts are offered by the retailer alone or by the supply chain enterprises through Nash bargaining, this study compares the results of the centralised model, the decentralised model, the quality cost-sharing model, and the revenue-sharing model. It investigates whether the quality incentive strategies can coordinate the supply chain and reveals the optimal quality incentive strategy (contract) and the optimal decision type of the quality incentive strategy (contract) to motivate the improvement of the quality and profitability of the supply chain. Finally, this study discusses the effects of product liability on the equilibrium results through numerical analysis. The equilibrium results show that (1) compared with the decentralisation case, both the quality cost-sharing contract (strategy) and the revenue-sharing contract ( strategy) can improve the quality level of the products, the profitability of the supply chain members, and the whole supply chain system effectively. However, the quality cost-sharing contract improves them over the revenuesharing contract. (2) Further, the quality level of the products, market demand, and retailer′s profit are higher under the retailer-led quality incentive strategies than under the Nash bargaining-led quality incentive strategies. In contrast, the manufacturer′s profit and the supply chain′s overall profit are higher under the Nash bargaining-led quality incentive strategies than under the retailer-led quality incentive strategies. This result reveals that a lower quality level and market demand can result in higher profitability for the total supply chain. Meanwhile, the Nash bargaining-led quality cost-sharing contract is the most effective strategy to improve the supply chain system′s profit. In addition, the numerical analysis results show that (1) the increase of the liability cost raises the supply chain members′ motivations to implement the quality cost-sharing contract. However, it decreases the motivation to implement the revenuesharing contract. (2) A high quality cost-sharing rate does not mean a high quality level and a high profitability for the supply chain system. (3) An increase in the product liability will not lead to an increase in the quality level and an increase in the profitability of the supply chain members and system © 2023, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this blinded clinical trial, we attempted to compare the efficacy and safety of administering tranexamic acid, dexmedetomidine and nitroglycerin in preventing intraoperative bleeding and improving the quality of the surgical field during septorhinoplasty under general anesthesia. A total of 105 patients scheduled for septorhinoplasty were enrolled and randomly assigned into three groups based on the balanced-block randomization method. First group received 1 μg/kg intravenous injection dexmedetomidine, second group received 10 mg/kg intravenous injection tranexamic acid and third group received 0.5 μg/kg nitroglycerin, intravenously. The study sample was composed of 105 participants with the total mean age of 25.85 ± 6.52 years, and 59.05% of participants were female and the mean of body mass index was 24.34 ± 2.57 kg/m2. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in terms of arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, bleeding rate, duration of surgery, and surgeon satisfaction among the three groups; however, there was a significant difference in the extubation time, recovery time and the dose of administered propofol among the three groups. Dexmedetomidine reduced the dose of administered propofol while increasing the extubation time and recovery time. In the tranexamic acid group compared with the other two groups, the recovery time was shorter. However, all the three drugs could reduce intraoperative bleeding and lead to surgeon satisfaction. It can be concluded that all these three drugs can be utilized to control bleeding and improve the quality of the surgical field but the ultimate decision lies with the anesthesiologist's judgment and the conditions of the patient.

      " Abstract: We argue that insiders' decisions to trade in short windows before news announcements are likely to result from a trade-off between the incentives to capitalize on the foreknowledge of the disclosure and the risk of regulatory scrutiny and reputation loss. We provide evidence that the decision of insiders to buy is driven by this trade-off. We show that insiders strategically choose the amount of shares bought ahead of good news announcements, as they increase their purchases when the price impact of the news goes up, but the amount of shares purchased levels off as the news becomes extreme. In contrast, their sell trades are primarily influenced by the deterring effect of the regulatory and reputation risks, as the probability of their sell trades decreases significantly with the price impact of the forthcoming bad news. To further support our arguments on the importance of incentives and disincentives to trade, we show that the strategic trading is mainly observed in the most price-sensitive groups of news announcements, and is clearly pronounced for best informed executives (CEOs), and that the trading patterns change with changes in regulations, and insiders with higher reputational risk limit their trading ahead of bad news. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

We show that this supposition is not true. If the decision to respond is correlated with a substantive variable of interest, then regression or analysis of variance methods based upon the questionnaire results may be adversely affected by self-selection bias. Moreover such bias may arise even where response is 100%. The problem in both cases arises where selection information is passed to the score indirectly via the disturbance or individual effects, rather than entirely via the observable explanatory variables.

Methods of estimation of antenna dimensions, impedance matching, excitation procedure and choice of suitable materials to be used in the fabrication are briefly described. The RDRA dimensions are obtained by solving the transcendental equation derived from Maxwell equations using dielectric waveguide model. Some ceramics are found useful for fabrication of DRAs that yield large bandwidth and gain are summarized. An attempt to explore the application of dielectric materials having small dielectric loss (tan δ > 0.01) has been made by developing RDRA configurations using one, two and three element arrays, and effect of dielectric loss on their performance is studied using ANSYS HFSS simulations. For a RDRA array comprising of three elements, where the middle parasitic element has small dielectric loss (tan δ ~ 0.1) and the outer elements are aperture coupled, the gain decreases only by 2.7%, while the bandwidth is enhanced by 3%. The findings indicate the possibility of using ceramics having small dielectric loss such as Ba1−xSrxTiO3 (x = 0.35, tan δ ~ 0.1) with some trade-off with gain by using suitable designs. Equivalent circuit modelling useful in understanding the performance of microstrip aperture-coupled RDRA is also presented. © 2019, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.\u001b[0m :\n",

Contends that this is a misconception, as the reported cases indicate that the US courts have been reluctant so far to find teachers liable at common law for careless teaching, or “educational malpractice”. The courts have justified this reluctance on “policy” grounds, arguing that to impose such a liability on teachers would not be in the public interest. However, in a recent decision in Britain, the House of Lords held that educators are under a duty of care when advising on the educational needs of students. Examines the following issues: the extent to which at present Australian teachers could be liable for loss suffered by students as a result of poor teaching; the House of Lords’ decision on educational negligence, the US courts’ policy reasons for refusing to hold teachers liable for poor teaching; whether the Australian courts should follow the US courts or the House of Lords; and the likelihood of Australian teachers being sued for educational malpractice in the near future. © 1996, MCB UP Limited\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: There has been a major and rising interest in India for increasing vaccination rate among peoples to make the nation healthier and safer. In this paper, a new hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict and target vaccination rates in the less immunized regions. The Rank-Based Multi-Layer Perceptron (R-MLP) hybrid deep learning framework uses the data collected from the recently updated District Level Household Survey-4 (DLHS). R-MLP model predicts and categorizes the percentage of partly immunized vaccination rates as extreme, low and medium ranges. This predicted findings are cross-verified by Deep Soft Cosine Semantic and Ranking SVM based model (DSS-RSM). DSS-RSM model uses the data obtained from the medical practitioners through a location-based social network. The proposed model predicts and extracts patterns with high similarity frequency for identifying vulnerable low immunization regions. It classifies the predicted patterns into two classes such as Class 1 is denoted as high ranked regions and Class 2 is denoted as low ranked regions based on the percentage of pattern matches. Finally, the results from R-MLP and DSS-RSM models are cross-linked together using ensemble model. This model finds the loss values to identify the target regions were health care program need to be conducted for increasing the level of immunization among children's. The proposed hybrid deep learning models trains and validates using python-based Keras and TensorFlow deep learning libraries. The performance of the proposed hybrid deep learning model is compared with other variant machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree C5.0, Naive Bayes and Linear Regression. This comparative results are evaluated using evaluation measures such as Precision, Recall, Accuracy and F1-Measure. Our results show that the hybrid deep learning system is clearly superior to any other alternative approach.  © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Larvae of the genus Spodoptera spp. are highly polyphagous and can cause economical losses in several agricultural crops. Given their growing importance in the tomato crop, especially for industry, this work aimed to evaluate the feeding non-preference by larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith, 1797) and Spodoptera eridania (Cramer, 1782) on tomato genotypes and classify them by the levels of resistance. The commercial cultivar Santa Clara was set as the susceptible standard and line PI 134417 as the resistant standard to evaluate the lines PI 134418, PI 126931, LA 462 and LA 716. Feeding non-preference tests were performed under non-choice and free-choice conditions to evaluate the genotype attractiveness to larvae at predetermined times after their release, as well as the leaf area consumed. Overall, the genotypes LA 716 and PI 126931 were the least attractive to S. frugiperda, whereas Santa Clara was the most attractive and consumed. For S. eridania, the genotypes PI 126931, LA 462, LA 716 and PI 134418 were the least preferred for feeding, and Santa Clara and PI 134417 were the most attractive and consumed. The genotypes LA 716 and PI 126931 are moderately resistant to S. frugiperda and S. eridania; PI 134418 and LA 462 are moderately resistant to S. eridania; PI 134417 is susceptible to S. frugiperda and S. eridania; and Santa Clara is highly susceptible to both S. frugiperda and S. eridania.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The stone crab, Menippe spp. (Say, 1918), fishery is a large fishery in the southeastern United States. One of the primary regulations for this fishery requires that fisherman only harvest crab claws and return the living crab to the ocean. This regulation was put in place in an effort to reduce the overall mortality of harvested organisms and to promote fishery sustainability; however, fishery-related claw loss is likely to influence the population through multiple pathways. How fishery-related claw loss influenced stone crab diet choice, prey size selection, and consumption over time was examined, in addition to how these factors may influence the reproduction of harvested individuals. The consumption of soft-bodied prey, such as polychaete worms, was not influenced by claw loss. In contrast, claw loss has strong negative impacts on the consumption of more common hard-bodied prey, such as bivalves. Specifically, 1-clawed stone crabs consumed bivalves that were approximately 15% smaller after claw removal and consumed, on average, approximately 50% fewer bivalve prey than 2-clawed stone crabs. These decreases in consumption persisted over time. As a result of these dietary changes, stone crabs are likely to experience energetic constraints after claw removal that may limit the growth, reproduction, and survival of harvested stone crabs.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Erosion wear is a serious problem that constantly accompanies the operation of the system for hydraulic transportation of solid materials. The consequences are the loss of material (steel), loss of work element's working capacity, great operational expenses, etc. The choice of new materials for working elements, improvements in construction, and optimization of the slurry flow are all various ways of softening the consequences of erosion wear that reflects on the working life of the hydraulic transportation pump's elements. Data, which would be used for acquiring the above mentioned goals, are mainly acquired through testing in laboratory or semi industrial conditions. It has been proved that numerous influential and time effected values, complex and long term research, etc., make this job an expensive one, and the results are often solely applicable to specific operating conditions. To resolve this problem, the author suggests a combined approach: shorthand experimental researches and mathematical modeling of erosion wear. The suggested model, used for defining the mass loss of the working element affected by solid particles in the slurry, offers the possibility of introducing a greater number of influential values, some of which have a coincidental character. Through the realization of this model, wear intensity data is acquired, which are practically noncoincidental values with a great degree of reliability, and which greatly coincide with the results acquired through measurements conducted on the test facility.

      " Abstract: In a review of 103 sets of data from 23 different studies of choice, Baum (1979) concluded that whereas undermatching was most commonly observed for responses, the time measure generally conformed to the matching relation. A reexamination of the evidence presented by Baum concludes that undermatching is the most commonly observed finding for both measures. Use of the coefficient of determination by both Baum (1979) and de Villiers (1977) for assessing when matching occurs is criticized on statistical grounds. An alternative to the loss‐in‐predictability criterion used by Baum (1979) is proposed. This alternative statistic has a simple operational meaning and is related to the usual F‐ratio test. It can therefore be used as a formal test of the hypothesis that matching occurs. Baum (1979) also suggests that slope values of between .90 and 1.11 can be considered good approximations to matching. It is argued that the establishment of a fixed interval as a criterion for determining when matching occurs, is inappropriate. A confidence interval based on the data from any given experiment is suggested as a more useful method of assessment. 1982 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Purpose. To compare femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) versus conventional phacoemulsification in shallow anterior chamber cataract patients with glaucoma or zonulysis. Methods. This was a single-center retrospective review of cataract surgeries in shallow anterior chamber and glaucoma patients between January 2016 and December 2018 in which a LenSx femtosecond laser was used. The outcome measures included pre- and postoperative uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (UDVA and CDVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), endothelial cell density (ECD), endothelial cell loss (ECL), and object scatter index (OSI). Results. One hundred and six eyes of 106 patients with a mean anterior chamber depth of 1.54 ± 0.51 mm were included in this study. Among them, 26 (23.2%) had zonulysis and 18 eyes had capsular tension ring implantation in general. The percentage of capsular tension ring implantation was statistically significantly lower in the FLACS group (P = 0.027). The UDVA, CDVA, ECD, and IOP were not statistically significant between the two groups at all time points. The postoperative ECL and OSI of the FLACS group was better than those of the conventional group (P < 0.01). Conclusions. FLACS can reduce ECL and improve visual quality compared to the conventional phacoemulsification in shallow anterior chamber patients. Also, it has the trend of reducing the use of capsular tension rings in subluxated cataracts. It is an ideal choice for patients with complicated cataract such as with shallow anterior chambers, glaucoma, and zonulysis. © 2020 Zhou Zhou et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: If habitat selection is adaptive, habitat choice by individuals should be directly associated with reproductive success. With that expectation in mind, we examined consequences of habitat choice in Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) in southern California. Habitat selection in Sage Sparrows was pronounced, with vegetation measurements within territories differing significantly from those of interspersed unoccupied areas. Likewise, sites where sparrows placed their nests were significantly different from random sites within territories. Both successful territories (those containing a nest that fledged at least one young) and successful nest sites differed significantly in habitat from those that were unsuccessful. However, there was an inverse relationship between choice and its consequences; the mean score of unsuccessful territories on a discriminant function describing the habitat gradient from unoccupied to occupied areas (i.e., choice) was significantly higher than the mean for successful ones. In other words, birds preferred to settle in areas in which they did worse. Thus, attractiveness of habitat has become inversely related to its suitability, and the study site now serves as an 'ecological trap.' Because predation accounted for 80-90% of nest loss, we speculate that decoupling of habitat attractiveness from suitability has been produced by redistribution of predators (mainly snakes) due to anthropogenic landscape-level changes in the region.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In this article, the authors explore whether choice patterns are sensitive to the potential of relevant trade-offs to elicit negative emotion. Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects’ relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992). © 1999 American Marketing Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Case–control analyses have shown BARD1 variants to be associated with up to >2-fold increase in risk of breast cancer, and potentially greater risk of triple negative breast cancer. BARD1 is included in several gene sequencing panels currently marketed for the prediction of risk of cancer, however there are no gene-specific guidelines for the classification of BARD1 variants. We present the most comprehensive assessment of BARD1 messenger RNA splicing, and demonstrate the application of these data for the classification of truncating and splice site variants according to American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) guidelines. Methods: Nanopore sequencing, short-read RNA-seq (whole transcriptome and targeted), and capillary electrophoresis analysis were performed by four laboratories to investigate alternative BARD1 splicing in blood, breast, and fimbriae/ovary related specimens from non-cancer affected tissues. Splicing data were also collated from published studies of nine different tissues. The impact of the findings for PVS1 annotation was assessed for truncating and splice site variants. Results: We identified 62 naturally occurring alternative spliced BARD1 splicing events, including 19 novel events found by next generation sequencing and/or reverse transcription PCR analysis performed for this study. Quantitative analysis showed that naturally occurring splicing events causing loss of clinically relevant domains or nonsense mediated decay can constitute up to 11.9% of overlapping natural junctions, suggesting that aberrant splicing can be tolerated up to this level. Nanopore sequencing of whole BARD1 transcripts characterized 16 alternative isoforms from healthy controls, revealing that the most complex transcripts combined only two alternative splicing events. Bioinformatic analysis of ClinVar submitted variants at or near BARD1 splice sites suggest that all consensus splice site variants in BARD1 should be considered likely pathogenic, with the possible exception of variants at the donor site of exon 5. Conclusions: No BARD1 candidate rescue transcripts were identified in this study, indicating that all premature translation-termination codons variants can be annotated as PVS1. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that all donor and acceptor (IVS+/−1,2) variants can be considered PVS1 or PVS1_strong, with the exception of variants targeting the exon 5 donor site, that we recommend considering as PVS1_moderate. © Copyright © 2019 Walker, Lattimore, Kvist, Kleiblova, Zemankova, de Jong, Wiggins, Hakkaart, Cree, Behar, Houdayer, Investigators, Parsons, Kennedy, Spurdle and de la Hoya.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Decisions are often based on imprecise, uncertain or vague information. Likewise, the consequences of an action are often equally unpredictable, thus putting the decision maker into a twofold jeopardy. Assuming that the effects of an action can be modeled by a random variable, then the decision problem boils down to comparing different effects (random variables) by comparing their distribution functions. Although the full space of probability distributions cannot be ordered, a properly restricted subset of distributions can be totally ordered in a practically meaningful way. We call these loss-distributions, since they provide a substitute for the concept of loss-functions in decision theory. This article introduces the theory behind the necessary restrictions and the hereby constructible total ordering on random loss variables, which enables decisions under uncertainty of consequences. Using data obtained from simulations, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach. © 2016 Rass et al.

The authors assess this phenomenon in a series of three experiments, in which people are exposed to sequential and fair gambles in a two-stage process (planned and actual bets). The results show that in the planning phase, people behave conservatively, betting on average less after an anticipated loss and the same amount after an anticipated gain. However, after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned, whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan after an actual gain. The reason for such asymmetry is due in part to people's tendency to underestimate, at the planning phase of the gamble, the impact of negative emotions in betting decisions during the actual phase of the gamble.\u001b[0m :\n",

We aimed to determine the potential effectiveness of the application of mupirocin cream at the catheter exit site in preventing exit site infection and peritonitis. Methods: This prospective historically controlled study was done in a total of 86 patients who entered our PD program from April 1999 to January 2001. They were instructed to apply Mupirocin cream 2% to the exit site daily or on alternate days. The patients were not screened to determine whether they were staphylococcus aureus carriers. One hundred and thirteen patients on PD prior to April 1999 acted as historical controls. Both groups were followed prospectively for a period of 22 months. Results: In the study group application of mupirocin lead to a significant reduction in the incidence rate of both exit site infections overall (0.43 vs. 0.09; p<0.0001) and ESI due staphylococcus aureus (0.14 vs. 0.02; p=0.004) amounting to a relative reduction of 79% and 85% respectively. Although the overall incidence of peritonitis did not change (0.28 vs. 0.26; p=0.7) there was a significant reduction in peritonitis caused by staphylococcus aureus (0.07 vs. 0; p=0.01) Although only one catheter required removal in the mupirocin group as against 5 in the control group, this was not statistically significant.

      " Abstract: Since the propagation of deep neural networks results in the loss of detailed feature information, the performance of most object detection methods is limited due to their tendency to learn regional features in visual space while neglecting relationships between objects. Therefore, this study proposes the Graph Relational Decision Network (GRDN), which mines relationships between objects in a dataset. The GRDN consists of a graph decision network, decision coefficient, and step-wise relation deduction module. The graph decision network comprises an edge decision network, and a node decision network, wherein a data-driven technique is employed to obtain implicit relationships between labels in a dataset. These relationships are expressed through an adaptive dynamic graph, which is subsequently recoded by means of the decision coefficient, which can enhance semantic information. In the step-wise relation deduction module, semantic information is employed as a guide to prevent distraction. A series of experiments were conducted on the MS COCO dataset. The proposed method achieves 52.8% box AP on object detection, which is 2.3% box AP higher than Cascade Mask R-CNN. The experimental results show that the addition of dynamic semantic information in this study can make up for the loss of detailed information and focus on key information, thereby improving the detection ability of small objects and occluded objects.

      " Abstract: Over the years, the literature on individual data anonymization has burgeoned in many directions. While such diversity should be praised, it does not come without some difficulties. Currently, the task of selecting the optimal analytical environment is complicated by the multitude of available choices and the fact that the performance of any method is generally dependent of the data properties. In light of these issues, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, based on recent insights from the literature and inspired by cryptography, it proposes a new anonymization method that shows that the task of anonymization can ultimately rely only on ranks permutations. As a result, the method offers a new way to practice data anonymization by performing it ex-ante and independently of the distributional features of the data instead of being engaged, as it is currently the case in the literature, in several ex-post evaluations and iterations to reach the protection and information properties sought after. Second, the method establishes a conceptual connection across the field, as it can mimic all the currently existing tools. To make the method operational, this paper proposes also the introduction of permutation menus in data anonymization, where recently developed universal measures of disclosure risk and information loss are used ex-ante for the calibration of permutation keys. To justify the relevance of their uses, a theoretical characterization of these measures is also proposed. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Changes in climate and land use, caused by socio-economic changes, greenhouse gas emissions, agricultural policies and other factors, are known to affect both natural and managed ecosystems, and will likely impact on the European terrestrial carbon balance during the coming decades. This study presents a comprehensive European Union wide (EU15 plus Norway and Switzerland, EU*) assessment of potential future changes in terrestrial carbon storage considering these effects based on four illustrative IPCC-SRES storylines (A1FI, A2, B1, B2). A process-based land vegetation model (LPJ-DGVM), adapted to include a generic representation of managed ecosystems, is forced with changing fields of land-use patterns from 1901 to 2100 to assess the effect of land-use and cover changes on the terrestrial carbon balance of Europe. The uncertainty in the future carbon balance associated with the choice of a climate change scenario is assessed by forcing LPJ-DGVM with output from four different climate models (GCMs: CGCM2, CSIRO2, HadCM3, PCM2) for the same SRES storyline. Decrease in agricultural areas and afforestation leads to simulated carbon sequestration for all land-use change scenarios with an average net uptake of 17-38 Tg C/year between 1990 and 2100, corresponding to 1.9-2.9% of the EU*s CO2 emissions over the same period. Soil carbon losses resulting from climate warming reduce or even offset carbon sequestration resulting from growth enhancement induced by climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the second half of the twenty-first century. Differences in future climate change projections among GCMs are the main cause for uncertainty in the cumulative European terrestrial carbon uptake of 4.4-10.1 Pg C between 1990 and 2100. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Physical-layer (PHY) cooperation is a technique for achieving multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO)-like performance improvements on small devices that cannot support antenna arrays. Devices in a network transmit on behalf of their neighbors to act as 'virtual MIMO' antennas. Since small devices are typically battery constrained, PHY cooperation immediately leads to the following question related to the energy efficiency (bits per joule) of devices: Is the performance improvement worth the extra energy costs of transmitting for others? Through an in-depth hardware test-bed study, we find that PHY cooperation can improve energy efficiency by as much as 320%, or it can reduce energy efficiency by as much as 25%, depending upon topology. With this performance gap in mind, we propose the distributed energy-conserving cooperation (DECC) protocol. DECC tunes the amount of effort that each device dedicates to providing cooperative assistance for others so that the energy that each device spends on cooperation is commensurate with the personal benefits that are received by that device. With DECC, users can tune their level of cooperation with completely node-localized decision-making. Thus, DECC allows nodes to tap into a large energy-efficiency benefit, suffering only a bounded preset loss when this benefit is not available. © 2013 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Boundary layer separation and reattachment is often an unavoidable feature of low pressure (LP) turbine, one of the main causes of this phenomenon is the high altitude low Reynolds number experienced by the modern LP turbine stage in aero-engine. Although an excellent turbine airfoil design can avoid flow separation on certain extent, but within flight envelope, LP turbine's characteristic Reynolds number may varied greatly, so it will be still under the risk of the presence of separation bubble. In this two parts paper a new concept of slotted-blade was raised to testify the gain of the blade slotting. A high aerodynamic loading LP turbine blade IET-LPTA was under investigated with different Reynolds number. Computational results reveal that the blade slotting could be a way of choice to suppress separation bubble and reduce profile loss under the condition of low Reynolds number, although its position and geometry need to be further investigated. © 2011 Science Press, Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Reliable predictors of outcomes after treatment discontinuation in HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients have not been established. We investigated the role of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP10) and hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) serum levels as predictors of HBsAg loss, relapse and retreatment in noncirrhotic HBeAg-negative CHB patients who discontinued long-term antiviral therapy. All HBsAg-positive (n = 57) patients of the prospective DARING-B study were included and followed monthly for 3 months, every 2/3 months until month-12 and every 3/6 months thereafter. HBsAg, IP10 and HBcrAg levels were measured by enzyme immunoassays, and SCALE-B score was calculated. Twelve patients achieved HBsAg loss before retreatment with 18-month cumulative incidence of 25%. Independent predictors of HBsAg loss were baseline HBsAg and month-1 IP10 levels. Of 10 patients with baseline HBsAg ≤100 IU/mL, 70% cleared HBsAg and 10% required retreatment. Of 23 patients with baseline HBsAg >1000 IU/mL, 4% cleared HBsAg and 43% required retreatment. Of 24 patients with intermediate baseline HBsAg (100-1000 IU/mL), 17% cleared HBsAg and 21% required retreatment; in this subgroup, month-1 IP10 was significantly associated with HBsAg loss, which occurred in 30% and 7% of cases with IP10 >150 and ≤150 pg/mL, respectively. Baseline HBcrAg was undetectable in all patients who cleared HBsAg and was associated with retreatment. SCALE-B was associated with HBsAg loss but not with relapse or retreatment. In conclusion, HBsAg, IP10 and HBcrAg serum levels can be useful for the decisions and management of treatment discontinuation in noncirrhotic Caucasian patients with HBeAg-negative CHB. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: The paper presents a practical tool for supporting practitioners, consultants and researchers in the achievement of logistics effectiveness improvements in the fashion supply chain, through the determination of the expected profitability concerning RFID-based technology investments. Moreover, the limits related to the multipurpose implementation of this technology have been highlighted. The research explores the main cost items of an RFID based application, in order to understand to which extent the increased effectiveness, usually triggered by its implementation, is able to cover those costs. Main sources of knowledge are practitioners' report, scientific literature and case studies on the specific field. These investigations have conducted to the evidence that the RFID based applications and their investments are usually undertaken without a clear understanding of all the implications on the companies' P&L (profit and loss): the tool presented has been designed to fill this gap, providing an easy-to-use algorithm to evaluate a priori the profitability of the investment. The aim of this study is to support practitioners and managers in evaluating a priori the profitability of a RFID based investment in the fashion supply chain, understanding the related pay-back period (PBP); this indirectly will increase the success of RFID-based project implementations while reducing the uncertainty in terms of economical results. The main contribute of this research resides in the model's ease of use, quickness and effectiveness, grossly defining the economical expectations of an RFID investment; given the difficulties in defining precise figures, the study could support the investment choices. © 2014/2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

      " Abstract: The present study examined two groups of amnesic subjects (Korsakoff and PostEncephalitic) on tests of object recency. In the first test the subject tried to select the object that had been shown most recently from a pair of familiar objects. Compared with their respective controls both amnesic group were severely, and similarly, impaired. This impairment did not, however, appear to reflect a failure to engage specific rehearsal strategies. In the second test a dissociation was found between judgements of recency and recognition for the same item. This was consistent with the lack of correlation between recency performance and performance on a number of other memory tests. The present findings suggest that the underlyng cause of the recency memory deficit in amnesia is different to that responsible for other memory losses. They also point to a dissociation between the processes involved in estimating recency and temporal duration. © 1995, Masson S.p.A.. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Electrowetting is well-established as a fluid manipulation technique in such areas as lab-on-a-chip, visible light optics, and displays, yet has seen far less implementation in the field of radio-frequency (RF) electronics and electromagnetics. This is primarily due to a lack of appropriate materials selection and control in these devices. Low loss RF conductive fluids such as room temperature liquid metals (i.e. Hg, EGaIn, Galinstan) are by far the leading choice of active material due to their superior electrical properties but require high actuating voltages due to their inherently high surface tensions (>400 mN m-1) which often lead to dielectric breakdown. While the toxicity of Hg encourages the pursuit of non-toxic alternatives such as gallium alloys, the native surface oxide formation often prohibits reliable device functionality. Additionally, traditional electrowetting architectures rely on lossy electrode materials which degrade RF transmission efficiencies and result in non-reversible material diffusion at the electrode/liquid metal contact. In this work, we report on approaches to utilize liquid metals in electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) devices that resolve all of these challenges by judicious choice of novel electrode materials, dielectric fluid, and device architecture. A functional RF device, namely an electromagnetic polarizer, is demonstrated that can be activated on demand through EWOD and provides an average signal attenuation of 12.91 dB in the on state and 1.46 dB in the off state over the range of 8-9.2 GHz, with a switching speed of about 12 ms. These results can be further extended to other RF applications such as tunable antennas, transmission lines, and switchable metasurfaces. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Price fluctuations in the crude oil market is important to both financial practitioners and market participants, since it not only affects investors’ investment, portfolio allocation and risk evaluation, but also influences strategic planning and market decisions. By using visibility graph algorithm (VG), the time series of 32-year crude oil price is converted to a corresponding single spot and futures price network respectively. The network topological structure implies that the single spot and futures price network both follow the power-law distribution and power-law index γ=2.8. When the crude oil market suffers from financial shock, stable price market is broken and reaches a collapse critical state. And, we find that the biggest connection cluster of price network with two communities S(r,pc) has a scaling relationship with interconnected nodes fraction r, and the scale index is δ = 1.3 near the critical point for different shock scenarios. Besides, similar to the results in a single price network, the rate of change of S(r,pc) also shows a scaling relationship with p−pc (the difference between attack strength 1−p and critical attack strength pc), the scale index γ = 1.5. Particularly, these two indices γ and δ satisfy the universal Wisdom's law. According to the above relationship, one can observe the changes of the biggest connection cluster of price network near critical attack strength, and make adjustments of investment quickly to avoid huge losses by comprehending this laws. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how firms overcome these barriers. Design/methodology/approach: This study followed a qualitative, field-study-based research design in which 23 decision-makers at food-based organizations were interviewed. Quotes were extracted and categorized to develop a conceptual model of the food recovery process. Findings: The conceptual model that evolved helps to explain decision-making related to FLW across the following dimensions: barriers to food recovery, incentives to overcome the barriers, internal processes for engaging in food recovery and external relationships influencing internal incentives and processes. In addition, the barriers and incentives were divided into operational and managerial issues. Originality/value: Building on the barriers to food recovery in prior research, we explored the processes that help firms overcome these barriers.

      " Abstract: The probabilistic forecast skill level of statistically downscaled European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts is determined in predicting maximum and minimum temperatures for weeks 1–4 lead times during 20-year December–January–February (DJF) seasons from 2001 to 2020 over South Africa. Skilful S2S forecasts are vital in assisting decision-makers in the development of contingency planning for any eventualities that may arise because of weather and climate phenomena. Extreme high- and low-temperature events over a prolonged period can lead to hyperthermia and hypothermia, respectively, and can lead to loss of life. The results from the relative operating characteristic (ROC) and reliability diagrams indicate that the ECMWF S2S model has skill in predicting maximum temperature up to week 3 ahead, particularly over the central and eastern parts of South Africa. The ROC scores indicate that the model has skill in predicting minimum temperature up to week 4 ahead for the above-normal category, particularly over the central and eastern parts of South Africa. Reliability diagrams indicate that the model has a tendency of overestimating the below-normal category when predicting both maximum and minimum temperatures for weeks 1–4 lead times over South Africa. Furthermore, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) pattern analysis suggests that when there are anomalously positive and negative predicted 850-hPa geopotential heights located over South Africa, there are anomalously hot and cold conditions during the DJF seasons over most parts of South Africa, respectively. These results suggests that statistical downscaling of model forecasts can improve forecast skill. Moreover, the results suggest that there is potential for S2S predictions in South Africa, and as such, S2S prediction system for maximum and minimum temperatures can be developed. © 2024 The Authors.

      " Abstract: In the 1940s, Carl Rogers introduced the notion of a client-centred or person-centred approach, originally called the 'non-directive approach'. Over the past several decades, however, we have lost sight of the true intent behind Roger's relational approach, settling instead on well-intended but often paternalistic approaches that place patients or clients at the centre of care, but rarely, if ever, actively involve them in decision-making. This is no more apparent than in the case of persons living with Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias who, due to the stigma and misunderstanding surrounding dementia, are often assumed to lack the capacity to be involved in their own care and the care of others. Drawing on our experience working directly with persons with dementia, family members and professionals, and systematic research on a number of mutual partnership initiatives, the purpose of this paper is to present an alternative approach, one that views persons with dementia as equal partners in the context of dementia care, support and formal services. © The Author(s) 2011.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In order to minimise thermal degradation effects such as yellowing and losses in molecular weight, distribution systems for polymer melts and solutions should be designed for residence times as small as possible for a given value of the total pressure loss. Tube and slit flow distributors that can be considered as mainly one-dimensional systems are analysed with respect to an optimal ratio of technical expenditure (pressure loss) and gain in polymer quality (reduction in residence time, i.e. in thermal degradation). Assuming steady, fully developed, laminar flow and excluding changes in the rheology of the liquid with residence time, this leads to mathematical optimisation problems which may be solved by the methods of the calculus of variations. The definition of average residence time turns out to be ambiguous for systems with more than one inlet or one outlet. The problem may be defined in two alternative ways, using different measures of residence time. One of these time measures, called \"travel time\", turns out to be superior as a criterion for the optimisation of distributors for polymeric liquids. Based on this criterion, a general design rule for optimising slit and tube distributors is derived. This rule states that, in order to minimise the travel times within a system, it is sufficient to choose the diameter of the tubes or the slit width in such a way that the local apparent wall shear rate is uniform throughout the whole system. This rule has a broad range of applicability. It holds for arbitrary non-linear flow curves of the liquid under consideration and for arbitrary total flow rates. In addition, the choice of a uniform wall shear rate and, hence, a uniform wall shear stress safeguards the highest level of protection against wall fouling throughout the system at the lowest possible cost (pressure loss). © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

      " Abstract: Two paradigms are dominant in the international discourse on the System of Case Guiding (‘SCG’). The first ‘transplantation’ paradigm posits that the SCG is a straightforward transplant of the Anglo-American system of common law. The second ‘hybridisation’ paradigm views the SCG as a distinct but inferior common law, held back by its ‘Chinese characteristics’. These paradigms are challenged as being partial, outdated and inaccurate accounts of the SCG on two tiers. On a comparative and theoretical tier, this article builds upon the foundations of three concepts to mount its sustained critique. First, preferring Teubner’s description of legal change and reform as proceeding by legal ‘irritation’, it is argued that the notion of ‘transplantation’ is too blunt an account of how contemporary legal reform within the People’s Republic of China (‘PRC’) has sought to learn from and build upon the experiences of other legal systems. Second, accepting Santos’s call for a decentred approach to globalisation, the development of the SCG is situated foremost within its local context, instead of by reference to foreign systems of precedent. In doing so, this article moves beyond the old paradigms of ‘transplantation’ and ‘hybridisation’ towards a recognition of the distinctiveness of the SCG as an autochthonous innovation of the Chinese legal community that has been precisely tailored to its unique conditions. Third and finally, applying the concept of legal plurality to the practice of using Guiding Cases and precedent more generally, it is recognised that the development of the SCG has been driven, not only by the top-down actions of the Supreme People’s Court (‘SPC’), but also by its synergistic interaction with the bottom-up use of precedent by the wider legal community of litigants and legal professionals. Freed from the conceptual burdens of these two paradigms, this article proceeds to advance this theoretical basis for understanding the SCG by reference to an empirical analysis of three Guiding Cases–Numbers 24, 15 and 9. The first two are the most highly cited Guiding Cases; the third was one of the most often cited Guiding Cases as well, before losing its guiding effect. By reference to these three case studies, which involved analysing 939 judicial decisions, this article constructs a pluralistic account of the evolving judicial practice of referencing Guiding Cases. First, it is found that the distinctiveness of the SCG stems from the referent function of Guiding Cases, which is at the core of its judicial practice. This referent function is evident from the vast majority of judicial decisions that cite or refer to one of the three Guiding Cases as a formal authority for reaching their conclusion, without more. Second, however, it is also found that while this function of Guiding Cases might be the dominant form of judicial practice at this moment, this practice is not monolithic and is in fact changing at the margins. A small minority of cases since 2016 are illustrative of the potential trajectories of evolution for the next ten years of the SCG and the judicial practice of referencing Guiding Cases. These cases have evinced a greater willingness by courts to engage more meaningfully with precedent-based forms of reasoning, such as arguing from the facts of a case and arguing from the principles stated therein. This greater engagement has not only been driven by top-down mandates to search for and reference a wider variety of cases beyond Guiding Cases, but has also been driven by the bottom-up use of precedents by litigants in presenting their legal arguments before the courts. While these marginal practices are still in their infancy, the empirical analysis provides evidence of a complex, complicated and pluralistic practice of greater and more substantial reliance on Guiding Cases within the PRC. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Advances in materials and techniques, especially those involving transposition of muscle and skin flaps, have made breast reconstruction possible for most women who undergo mastectomy for breast cancer. The availability of this option can alleviate the breast and chest wall deformity that results from virtually all local treatment of breast cancer. It is essential that the reconstruction surgeon be part of the breast cancer management team from the beginning of treatment planning and that this surgeon work closely with the general surgeon, medical oncologist, and radiation therapist as well as the adjunctive treatment team members. The patient's clinical status and the type of local treatment will be significant determinants of the reconstructive options. For women with stage I breast cancer, these decisions may be based largely on the oncologist's local and adjunctive therapy procedures and the woman's desire to proceed or delay. For women with systemic disease, all members of the breast management team may need to agree on the advisability and timing of reconstruction. Central to all of the numerous decisions described in this paper regarding the timing, type, and extent of breast reconstruction is the primary goal of the entire team: the best possible management of the breast cancer itself. The promise of attractive, symmetric, and natural appearing breasts, complete with a symmetric nipple-areolar complex, has eased somewhat the diminishment of self-esteem and the threat to femininity that can accompany the loss of a breast. By lowering fear, the widely recognized availability of breast reconstruction may encourage more women to monitor their breasts and seek diagnosis of changes and may influence selection of the type of local treatment if cancer is detected. Because of the psychological and cultural significance of the breast, the reconstructive surgeon must be particularly sensitive to the psychological and aesthetic expectations of the patient. Even in those patients with metastases and limited life expectancy, breast reconstruction can enhance the quality of life.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Multilaterals are often cited as technology that can be implemented to maximize reservoir-recovery rates. However, few operators have been willing to put multilaterals into practice. The most frequently cited reason for not considering multilaterals is risk. Without access to data to show otherwise, it is difficult to overcome this industry perception of risk toward multilateral technology (MLT). This often leads to decisions not to run the technology on the basis of anecdotes of failed installations that occurred more than a decade ago with technology and circumstances far removed from what would be seen today. To move toward addressing this problem, the authors present a study of data from 22 years of actual multilateral-well applications, examining the true reliability of the technology. In this study, the records of one multilateral service provider have been analyzed from more than 800 actual multilateral installations, and success and failure rates have been determined. The reliability of multilaterals has been compared with the reliability rates of other wellbore-completion and -construction technologies. In the context of this study, reliability has been defined as the ability to successfully construct and complete a multilateral junction. Failure has been defined as the loss of either the lateral, main bore, or junction (and therefore access to both legs). Where failures have occurred, a study to determine root cause(s) has been undertaken. MLT, which was first implemented by Alexander Grigoryan in 1953, came into modern practice in the 1990s. Although it is not failure-free, the reliability of multilateral wells has improved remarkably during the past 22 years. This improvement in reliability has occurred as the complexities of multilateral installations have increased. This paper shows that successful completion rates of multilateral junctions have improved from slightly more than 87% for the period of 1995 to 1999 (with more than 100 junctions completed) to slightly more than 98% for the period of 2010 to 2015 (with more than 220 junctions completed). This improvement is the result of continuous planning, development of and adherence to procedures, management of change, communication, and continuous improvement. This is the first known study of multilateral reliability that encompasses a large body of data during a significant time period. The results presented should enable operators to make fact-based decisions about the reliability of MLT and about whether this technology should be considered for implementation into resource-development plans. © Copyright 2017 Society of Petroleum Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: In Colombia, one-third of the land is devoted to cattle farming, which is one of the main drivers of deforestation, land degradation, loss of biodiversity, and emissions of greenhouses gases. To mitigate the environmental impacts of cattle farming, agroforestry practices have been extensively promoted with mixed results. Despite research and extension efforts over the last 20-year period, agroforestry systems still involve a complex knowledge process among stakeholders that needs to be addressed. To understand the drivers of cattle farmers' behavior with regard to adopting agroforestry practices, we apply a double hurdle regression for different social, economic and productive information to capture the decision to adopt and the intensity of the adoption as a joint decision of such practices. For this purpose, we use data from a survey (implemented as part of an international project) administered to 1605 cattle farmers located in five agro-ecological regions in Colombia. Our dependent variables are defined by the adoption of four agroforestry practices: scattered trees, trees and shrubs for forage production, forestry plantations, and management of native forest. The adoption decision of agroforestry practices was influenced by the access and use of credit, location, and the implemented livestock system. Herd size and participation in development projects that involved tree planting had a positive influence on the adoption and intensity of agroforestry practices, while the variable associated with presence of water springs tended to boost the intensity of adoption. The diffusion of these technologies might be increased among farmers who have adopted and who are potential adopters, and social capital and networking can play a crucial role in spreading agroforestry as sustainable practice. © 2020 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: We consider a multicomponent, single-product assemble-to-order (ATO) system that faces frequent, component-based technology innovations. For each component, there are two technologies with overlapping life cycles coexisting in the market. All cost parameters associated with each technology (procurement cost, salvage value, etc.) evolve dynamically. We investigate two technology-inventory coordination schemes, one is at the strategic level, where technology and inventory decisions are sequentially made using partial information, and another is at the operational level, where technology and inventory decisions are jointly made using full information. The performance gap between the two coordination schemes quantifies the value of incorporating dynamic inventory information in technology management. We develop effective solution techniques and approximation methods and characterize their policy structures. Our numerical study indicates that the strategic-level technology-inventory coordination is generally sufficient, but the operational-level coordination becomes necessary when demand variability is high and salvage loss is heavy. We also propose a hybrid technology-inventory coordination scheme, whereby the firm adopts a technology management plan using the strategic-level coordination scheme, but executes it dynamically by adapting to inventory information, using a heuristic proposed in this paper. Our numerical study suggests that the hybrid strategy can virtually achieve the performance of the optimal operational level coordination. Our analysis provides guidelines for the effective technology-adoption and inventory-control coordination strategies in the ATO system with rapid innovations. © 2007 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Background: Bronchopneumonia caused by Mannheimia haemolytica affects sheep of all ages worldwide and may be devastating especially in young animals undergone recent stress (i.e. transportation, weaning, mixing with animals from different farms. It is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in lambs and kids, especially in those that have not received adequate colostrum or in which passive colostral immunity is waning. Yearly herd losses costing millions of dollars have led to research focused on theurapeutic trials and vaccine production because of various strains isolated demonstrating the continuing economic importance of Mannheimia haemolytica infection. A field trial was performed under commercial sheep farm located in Western Turkey, Aydin in an attempt to investigate the efficacy of an injectable formulation of florfenicol against naturally occuring Mannheimia haemolytica. Materials, Methods & Results: A total of 27 Sakiz breed lambs at the age of 36-60 days old, of both sexes, with naturally occuring M. haemolytica infection were included in the present study. Prior to allocation into groups, a detailed clinical examination carried out in all the lambs, revealed a variety of abnormal findings: coughing, presence of nasal and ophthalmic discharge, increased respiratory rate and rectal temperature and abnormal sounds at lung auscultation. A total of 27 samples taken from transtracheal aspiration bronchoalveolar fluid in the Sakiz breed lambs were taken into sterile containers in an attemp to perform isolation and identification of Mannheimia haemolytica. The antibiotic susceptibility tests for Mannheimia haemolytica strains isolated from transtracheal aspiration bronchoalveolar fluid were carried out by disc diffusion as described previously. On days 0, 1, 7, 15 and 30 sheeps were given a clinical score. The clinical lesion score (scores from 0 to 3) was derived from the clinical signs (feed consumption oral and nasal discharges, coughing lung auscultation findings, complete clinical examination) and was carried out by an investigator blinded. The lambs were randomly allocated into 2 groups until the required number of lambs in each group was reached. Lambs in group F (n = 17) were subcutaneoulsy injected with a single dose of florfenicol (dosage 2 mg/kg bodyweight); lambs in group C (n = 10) did not receive an antibiotic treatment and were left as controls. The efficacy of florfenicol was assessed clinically and on the basis of a lesion score derived from the physical examination. Throughout the study florfenicol treatment significantly decreased (P < 0.01) the investigator's clinical scores while no significant changes were detected in the untreated control group. Discussion: M. haemolytica is a commonly recognized responsible agent for respiratory diseases in sheep and several therapeutic antibiotics have been suggested for treatment applications. Florfenicol, that might have the potential of efficacy against M. haemolytica has not been used in sheep, therfore there is lack of data regarding its efficacy and safety. Despite the efficacy of the drug against respiratory infections of calves and pigs has been documented. Besides bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of florfenicol was evaluated solely in healthy sheep. Based on clinical scoring and complete remission, and supporting laboratory signs involving antibiogram studies, results of the present study may indicate that florfenicol may be a good and safe choice for treatment of respiratory infections due to M. haemolytica. The present results were supported by the gradual improvement and alleviation of clinical signs and, clinical remission within description of scores and the absence of pathogenic organisms in transtracheal aspiration after treatment. Furthermore, florfenicol-treated lambs had a significantly better clinical improvement and cure that that of untreated control group of animals.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Aggressive conflicts between males are often resolved by means of multiple ritualized agonistic displays without damaging escalation. Apparently, in such cases by using those displays opponents exchange important motivational and physical information on which they base a decision to stay or leave the interaction. In the Siamese fighting fish, the time spent spreading the dorsal fin and erecting the gill coverts predicts who will be the winner or loser of the interaction. Two experiments were carried out to study whether display performance might be costly. First, oxygen consumption was measured during mirror-image stimulation. This experiment showed that oxygen consumption was positively correlated with gill cover erection and dorsal fin spread. In the second experiment, a fight between two opponents was simulated and the oxygen consumption of the expected winner and loser was compared. Metabolic rates were not different between winners and losers before and during the fight, but winners showed higher oxygen consumption in the night after the fight. These results are in accordance with costs of display performance and with longlasting physiological consequences of winning or losing a flght. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

As an adverse drug reaction of valproic acid, sialadenosis is very rare. To our knowledge, it has been reported only once in the world literature to date. We present herein the case of a patient with valproic acid-associated sialadenosis of both the parotid and submandibular glands. This appears to be the first published case of a patient who received surgical treatment. On light and electron microscopy of all the affected salivary glands, granular sialadenosis with predominantly moderate electron-dense secretory cytoplasmatic granules was observed. No relevant degenerative alterations were seen. There was no histological evidence of peripheral neuropathy of the nerve supply, leading to disordered activity of acinar cells by loss of neurosecretory granules. Lateral parotidectomy, performed under neuromonitoring control for safety reasons, is the treatment of choice for chronic recurrent parotitis that does not respond to conservative therapy, particularly if the cosmetic deformity is unacceptable to the patient. If the submandibular glands are involved, partial removal is recommended. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Objectives: The friction cost approach (FCA) is one way to estimate lost productivity, which considers the time taken to replace an employee, known as the friction period. The friction period may be influenced by local labour market conditions, limiting the relevance of international FCA estimates. The objective was to estimate the time and costs of replacing an employee in Australia. Methods: Staff responsible for recruitment in businesses across Australia were surveyed about the last management and non-management employee hired, workforce composition, friction period time and costs, and team dynamic effects. Primary analyses were conducted on respondents that recruited in the past 12 months. The friction period was decomposed into three periods: recruitment decision, recruitment period, and training period. Descriptive statistics of the friction period time and costs, and team dynamic effects were calculated. Results: The sample consisted of Australian businesses (N = 274), primarily micro-organisations (2–4 employees, 44%) in urban locations (75%). The time (12.3 weeks; SD 15.1) and costs ($6230; SD $17,502) to replace a manager were higher than those to replace non-managers (10.0 weeks, SD 13.01; $2666, sd $7849). The training period represented the longest time component in replacing an employee (38–40% of the total friction period). There was an increasing impact on other employees’ productivity, particularly for absent managers as time off work increased. Conclusions: The friction period in Australia was similar to international estimates. Interestingly, the friction period mainly consisted of time outside the recruitment period; the decision to recruit and the training period. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Quantitative landslide susceptibility assessment is necessary for mitigating casualties, property damage, and economic loss. Identification of landslides and preparation of landslide susceptibility maps are crucial steps in landslide susceptibility assessment. Therefore, an optimal landslide susceptibility model is presented that is capable of producing accurate landslide susceptibility maps and assessing landslide susceptibility. To construct the optimal landslide susceptibility model, the effectiveness of the improved self-organizing linear output map (ISOLO), support vector machines (SVM) with four kernel functions (LN-SVM, PL-SVM, RBF-SVM, and SIG-SVM) and logistic regression (LR) was compared. Twelve landslide causative factors (namely, slope, slope aspect, elevation, curvature, profile curvature, plan curvature, slope length, topographic wetness index, distance to river, distance to road, distance to fault and annual maximum 24- and 48-h rainfalls) were used in this landslide susceptibility analysis. These models were applied to the Kaoping River basin in Southwestern Taiwan to assess its performance. Landslide inventory maps from 2008 to 2011 were collected. Data from the first three-year period were used for training and the remaining data was used for testing. The performance of the models was compared using accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve as criteria. The results show that the RBF-SVM model outperformed the logistic regression in the study area. Using the RBF-SVM model, the landslide susceptibility under the annual 48-h maximum rainfall of various return periods were analyzed to assist local administrations and decision makers in disaster planning. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

Among the reasons for its loss of popularity are the high cost of the equipment, the complexity of the technique, and the large amount of substance necessary for an analysis. Nevertheless, moving boundary electrophoresis remains the method of choice for the determination of the mobility-pH curve of a biopolymer (1), for as pointed out by Kunkel (2) zone methods are incapable of providing absolute mobilities. The present note describes an extension of the capabilities of the moving boundary method to the determination of mobilities of a biologically active principle at very low concentrations and contained within an impure mixture. The procedure in our new method is similar in principle to that used to determine sedimentation coefficients with a partition cell in an analytical ultracentrifuge (3,4). In the latter technique, the quantity of active substance sedimented across a fixed plane in the cell is measured, generally by a specific sensitive analysis of the biological activity on one side of the partition relative to that in the original solution. An analogous procedure is described here for determination of electrophoretic mobilities in a moving boundary apparatus. © 1971.\u001b[0m :\n",

      " Abstract: Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a disease of older patients, but evidence-based guidelines for chemotherapy in older patients are scarce. Geriatric assessment (GA) evaluates a patient's functional status (FS) and helps in decision-making when choosing chemotherapy for older patients. However, the change of FS during chemotherapy is rarely studied as GA is mostly performed once instead of sequentially. Methods: We performed a subgroup analysis of a prospective, multicenter study EpiReal 75. Patients aged ≥75 years with gastrointestinal malignancy prior to initiation of chemotherapy or receiving palliative chemotherapy were screened. We defined geriatric core assessments including the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score, Barthel's activities of daily living (ADL) scale, Lawton's instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scale, and G-8 questionnaire, which were performed at baseline and repeated every 3 months. Quality of life (QoL) assessed by QLQ-C30 questionnaire was also re-evaluated every 3 months. We defined any deterioration in any of the geriatric parameters as unstable in the corresponding function. Results: 28 patients with CRC were enrolled between April 2014 and December 2018. 20 patients were evaluable for statistical analysis with a mean age of 78.5 years (range, 75-88). Most patients received chemotherapy in palliative setting. During 3 months of chemotherapy, 25% of patients became more dependent as measured by ADL or IADL. During a median follow-up of 15 months, patients with unstable ADL or IADL had a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with stable ADL or IADL (plogrank = 0.0055 and 0.0253, respectively), without a significant difference in progression-free survival (PFS). Also, unstable IADL correlated with a deterioration in aspects of QoL such as role functioning and emotional functioning (p = 0.0189 and 0.0239, respectively). 20% of patients experienced treatment-related grade 3 adverse events (AEs), no grade 4-5 AEs occurred. Conclusion: Sequential GA revealed changes in FS in older patients with CRC receiving chemotherapy. A deterioration of FS during chemotherapy did not influence PFS but had a negative impact on OS and QoL. It is therefore important to maintain FS in older patients with cancer, and regular performance of geriatric core assessments should be encouraged in the clinical practice. © 2022 \u001b[0m :\n",

To conduct cost-effectiveness analysis of bicycle/pedestrian trails. Design. The costs of trail development and number of users of four trails in Lincoln, NE, were obtained. The costs were adjusted to 2003 dollars. The physical activity-related outcomes/items are number of users who were more physically active since they began using the trails, number of users who were physically active for general health, and number of users who were physically active for weight loss.

      " Abstract: Objective: To establish a nomogram based on inflammatory indices and ICG-R15 for predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) among patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: A retrospective cohort of 407 patients with HCC hospitalized at Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between January 2015 and December 2020, and 81 patients with HCC hospitalized at the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between January 2019 and January 2020 were included in the study. Totally 488 HCC patients were divided into the training cohort (n=378) and the validation cohort (n=110) by random sampling. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors. Through combining these independent risk factors, a nomogram was established for the prediction of PHLF. The accuracy of the nomogram was evaluated and compared with traditional models, like CP score (Child-Pugh), MELD score (Model of End-Stage Liver Disease), and ALBI score (albumin-bilirubin) by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Cirrhosis (OR=2.203, 95%CI:1.070-3.824, P=0.030), prothrombin time (PT) (OR=1.886, 95%CI: 1.107-3.211, P=0.020), tumor size (OR=1.107, 95%CI: 1.022-1.200, P=0.013), ICG-R15% (OR=1.141, 95%CI: 1.070-1.216, P<0.001), blood loss (OR=2.415, 95%CI: 1.306-4.468, P=0.005) and AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) (OR=4.652, 95%CI: 1.432-15.112, P=0.011) were independent risk factors of PHLF. Nomogram was built with well-fitted calibration curves on the of these 6 factors. Comparing with CP score (C-index=0.582, 95%CI, 0.523-0.640), ALBI score (C-index=0.670, 95%CI, 0.615-0.725) and MELD score (C-ibasedndex=0.661, 95%CI, 0.606-0.716), the nomogram showed a better predictive value, with a C-index of 0.845 (95%CI, 0.806-0.884). The results were consistent in the validation cohort. DCA confirmed the conclusion as well. Conclusion: A novel nomogram was established to predict PHLF in HCC patients.

      " Abstract: Great Britain's decision to withdraw its forces from Southeast Asia by the mid-1970s created uncertainty for those living in the region. The potential loss of British presence led Australia to attempt to discourage Britain from leaving, while also recsognising recognising the decision as an opportunity to re-evaluate Australia's strategic outlook in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Scholars have treated Asia and the Pacific as two regions with distinct experiences related to withdrawal. Some address changing Anglo-Australian relations but include little, or no, mention of the Pacific territories. Others, writing about the Pacific, focused more the individual paths taken by each island than on connecting the larger process of decolonisation in the Pacific to the one in Asia. This article pairs Australia's Strategic Basis of Defence papers with documentary evidence across multiple departments in Canberra to understand how British withdrawal from east of Suez connected Australian concerns about security in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands.

      " Abstract: The development of new therapeutic leads against leishmaniasis relies primarily on screening of a large number of compounds on multiplication of clinically irrelevant transgenic promastigotes. The advent of the successful in vitro culture of axenic amastigotes allows the development of transgenic axenic amastigotes as a primary screen which can test compounds in a high throughput mode like promastigotes, still representative of the clinically relevant mammalian amastigotes stage. The present study reports the development of luciferase-tagged axenic amastigotes of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of Indian Kala-azar, for in vitro drug screening. Luciferase expressing promastigotes were transformed to axenic amastigotes at a low pH and high temperature without the loss of luciferase expression. As compared to transgenic promastigotes, the luciferase expressing axenic amastigotes exhibited more sensitivity to antileishmanial drugs, particularly to pentavalent antimony (∼2.8-fold) and also to the test compounds. Hence, the developed luciferase expressing axenic amastigotes make an ideal choice for high throughput drug screening for antileishmanial compounds. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",
