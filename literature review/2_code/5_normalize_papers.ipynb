      "\u001b[31m1 - Title: Adam Smith’s Theory of Prudence Updated with Neuroscientific and Behavioral Evidence\n",
      "Abstract: Other-perspective taking (OPT), distancing, time discounting as well as risk and loss aversion highly affect decision-making. Even though they influence each other, so far these cognitive processes have been unrelated or only partly related to each other in neuroscience. This article proposes a philosophical interpretation of these cognitive processes that is elaborated in the updated theory of Adam Smith’s prudence (UTSP). The UTSP is inspired by Smith’s account of prudence and is in line with the neuroscientific and behavioral studies on OPT, distancing, time discounting as well as risk and loss aversion. The UTSP represents a framework aiming to interpret and connect these cognitive processes and providing a consistent and empirically sound account of a “Smithianly” prudent style of decision-making. The two pillars of the UTSP are the shift of perspective in space and time (from the individual to others and from the present self to the future self) and loss aversion. On the basis of this theory, a normative updated theory of Smithian prudence is outlined (NUTSP). The latter is useful for moral philosophy for two reasons: firstly, according to preliminary evidence, it is effective in guiding the agent in decisional contexts in which her well-being is at stake and she can affect other people with her actions. Secondly, since the NUTSP is based on neuroscientific findings on decision-making, it has a sound empirical basis that prevents a source of alienation for the agent. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, we investigate homeowner preferences and willingness to pay for wildfire protection programs using a choice experiment with three attributes: risk, loss and cost. Preference heterogeneity among survey respondents was examined using three econometric models and risk preferences were evaluated by comparing willingness to pay for wildfire protection programs against expected monetary losses. The results showed that while nearly all respondents had risk seeking preferences, a small segment of respondents were risk neutral or risk averse. Only respondents who had personal experience with the effects of wildfire consistently made trade-offs among risk, loss and cost and these respondents were willing to pay more for wildfire protection programs than were respondents without prior experience of the effects of wildfire. The degree to which people with prior experience with the effects of wildfire can effectively articulate an economic rationale for investing in wildfire protection to other members of their own or other communities facing the threat of wildfires may influence the overall success of wildfire protection programs. © IAWF 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background Continued, persistent gambling to recover accumulating losses, or ‘loss-chasing’, is a behavioral pattern linked particularly closely to gambling disorder (GD) but may reflect impaired decision-making processes relevant to drug addictions like cocaine-use disorder (CUD). However, little is known regarding the neurocognitive mechanisms of this complex, maladaptive behavior, particularly in individuals with addictive disorders. Methods Seventy participants (25 GD, 18 CUD, and 27 healthy comparison (HC)) completed a loss-chase task during fMRI. Engagement of functional brain networks in response to losing outcomes and during decision-making periods preceding choices to loss-chase or to quit chasing losses were investigated using independent component analysis (ICA). An exploratory factor analysis was performed to examine patterns of coordinated engagement across identified networks. Results In GD relative to HC and CUD participants, choices to quit chasing were associated with greater engagement of a medial frontal executive-processing network. By comparison, CUD participants exhibited altered engagement of a striato-amygdala motivational network in response to losing outcomes as compared to HC, and during decision-making as compared to GD. Several other networks were differentially engaged during loss-chase relative to quit-chasing choices, but did not differ across participant groups. Exploratory factor analysis identified a system of coordinated activity across prefrontal executive-control networks that was greater in GD and CUD relative to HC participants and was associated with increased chasing persistence across all participants. Conclusions Results provide evidence of shared and distinct neurobiological mechanisms in substance and behavioral addictions, and lend insight into potential cognitive interventions targeting loss-chasing behavior in GD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In everyday life, people often make decisions on behalf of others. The current study investigates whether risk preferences of decision-makers differ when the reference point is no longer their own money but somebody else money. Thirty four healthy participants performed three different monetary risky choices tasks by making decisions for oneself and for another unknown person. Results showed that loss aversion bias was significantly reduced when participants were choosing on behalf of another person compared to when choosing for themselves. The influence of emotions like regret on decision-making may explain these results. We discuss the importance of the sense of responsibility embodied in the emotion of regret in modulating economic decisions for self but not for others. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the Risk-asfeelings hypothesis, suggesting that self-other asymmetrical behavior is due to the extent the decision-maker is affected by the real and emotional consequences of his/her decision. © 2014 Mengarelli et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: To manage the risk arising from uncertainty in market demand, this paper introduces the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) measure into the decision framework of the newsvendor who aims to minimise his opportunity loss. It is found under the CVaR measure that the newsvendors optimal order quantity is increasing in the confidence level when the understock loss is bigger than the overstock loss. This implies that an over-ordering may be even more caused by the newsvendors risk aversion about opportunity loss than risk seeking behaviour. Under this optimal order quantity, it is proved that the newsvendors expected profit and expected opportunity loss are decreasing and increasing in the confidence level, respectively. Furthermore, some management insights are presented to facilitate the risk management of the newsvendor model. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract.  This paper examines the probability judgments made by auditors for their financial statement footnote disclosure decisions and their audit report additional paragraph decisions in the presence of material loss contingencies. In the United States these judgments are governed by SFAS No. 5 and SAS No. 58. Two prior studies have reported inconsistent results pertaining to the degree of compliance of auditors with the judgment and decision‐making process implied by SFAS No. 5. In contrast, SAS No. 58 has not previously been examined with respect to auditor compliance. Results from an experiment with 64 audit partners from six firms were consistent with the hypothesis that audit partners employ the same (compensatory) judgment process when making footnote disclosure decisions as when making additional paragraph decisions. This process led the partners to make judgments for the additional paragraph decision that were in accordance with SAS No. 58. In contrast, their judgments for the footnote disclosure decision were consistent with a decision theory model of auditor behavior rather than the noncompensatory process implied by SFAS No. 5. Additional aspects of the study pertain to the additional paragraph decision of auditors. Observed judgments for these decisions are consistent with the hypothesis that additional information is conveyed beyond that provided by only a footnote disclosure. This is contrary to some recent discussions of the standards. Résumé.  Les auteurs étudient les jugements relatifs aux probabilités portés par les vérificateurs dans le cadre de leurs décisions relatives à la présentation des pertes éventuelles importantes sous forme de notes infrapaginales dans les états financiers ou de paragraphes supplémentaires dans le rapport des vérificateurs. Aux États‐Unis, ces jugements sont régis par le SFAS no 5 et le SAS no 58. Deux études antérieures ont donné des résultats dissemblables en ce qui a trait à la mesure dans laquelle les vérificateurs se conforment au processus de jugement et de prise de décisions que suppose le SFAS no 5. Le respect par les vérificateurs des normes du SAS no 58 n'a fait, quant à lui, l'objet d'aucune analyse. Les résultats d'une expérience menée auprès de 64 associés reponsables de la vérification dans six cabinets ont confirmé l'hypothèse selon laquelle les associés responsables de la vérification utilisent le même processus de jugement (compensatoire) lorsqu'ils décident de présenter les pertes éventuelles sous forme de notes infrapaginales que lorsqu'ils optent pour les paragraphes supplémentaires. Ce processus a amené les associés à porter des jugements pour l'ajout de paragraphes supplémentaires conformes au SAS no 58. Par opposition, leurs jugements relatifs à la présentation sous forme de notes infrapaginales étaient conformes à un modèle de comportement du vérificateur inspiré de la théorie de la décision plutôt qu'au processus non compensatoire que suppose le SFAS no 5. D'autres aspects de l'étude portent sur la décision des vérificateurs relative à l'ajout de paragraphes supplémentaires. Les jugements observés relativement à cette décision sont conformes à l'hypothèse selon laquelle d'autres renseignements sont transmis, outre ceux qui sont fournis par voie de simples notes infrapaginales. Ces résultats viennent contredire certaines analyses récentes portant sur les normes. 1991 Canadian Academic Accounting Association\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background/Objective: Death in intensive care units (ICUs) may increase bereaved family members’ risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, posttraumatic stress-related symptoms (hereafter as PTSD symptoms) and their precipitating factors were seldom examined among bereaved family members and primarily focused on associations between PTSD symptoms and patient/family characteristics. We aimed to investigate the course and predictors of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members of deceased ICU patients by focusing on modifiable quality indicators for end-of-life ICU care. Method: In this longitudinal observational study, 319 family members of deceased ICU patients were consecutively recruited from medical ICUs from two Taiwanese medical centers. PTSD symptoms were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 13 months post-loss using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Family satisfaction with end-of-life care in ICUs was assessed at 1 month post-loss. End-of-life care received in ICUs was documented over the patient’s ICU stay. Predictors for developing clinically significant PTSD symptoms (IES-R score ≥ 33) were identified by multivariate logistic regression with generalized estimating equation modeling. Results: The prevalence of clinically significant PTSD symptoms decreased significantly over time (from 11.0% at 1 month to 1.6% at 13 months post-loss). Longer ICU stays (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.036 [1.006, 1.066]), financial insufficiency (3.166 [1.159, 8.647]), and reported use of pain medications (3.408 [1.230, 9.441]) by family members were associated with a higher likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members during bereavement. Stronger perceived social support (0.937 [0.911, 0.965]) and having a Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR) order issued before the patient’s death (0.073 [0.011, 0.490]) were associated with a lower likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms. No significant association was observed for family members’ satisfaction with end-of-life care (0.988 [0.944, 1.034]) or decision-making in ICUs (0.980 [0.944, 1.018]). Conclusions: The likelihood of clinically significant PTSD symptoms among family members decreased significantly over the first bereavement year and was lower when a DNR order was issued before death. Enhancing social support and facilitating a DNR order may reduce the trauma of ICU death of a beloved for family members at risk for developing clinically significant PTSD symptoms. © 2021, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Cryptocurrency markets are inclined towards speculative usage due to the inherent high risk of financial loss and the potential for substantial gains during transaction completion. In response to this phenomenon, this study represents the inaugural effort to explore the influence of variables such as subjective norms, domain knowledge, impulsive investment tendencies, and self-control on decisions related to speculative investments. Utilising structural equation modelling with a dataset of 367 responses in India, the study is the first of its kind. The research reveals that subjective norms and domain knowledge play a significant role in influencing impulsive investment and self-control. Additionally, impulsive investment exhibits significant associations with decisions involving speculative investments. This insight underscores the complexity wherein individuals, despite exercising self-control, may still engage in speculative decisions that lead to adverse consequences. The findings have practical implications for investors and regulators, offering valuable insights into investment behaviours within the cryptocurrency realm. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

Our theory suggests that, in small and medium enterprises contexts, family entrepreneurs will be more likely to engage in PE than non-family entrepreneurs.

We explore possible relationships between waiting time and the cost-effectiveness of health care programs. The impact of waiting on cost-effectiveness is very scenario dependent and may be substantial, especially if health loss while waiting is partly or completely non-reversible. We argue that economic evaluations of health care programs in countries with waiting lists should consider the possible impact of waiting on costs and health effects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Pigeons prefer a low-probability, high-payoff but suboptimal alternative over a reliable low-payoff optimal alternative (i.e., one that results in more food). This finding is analogous to suboptimal human monetary gambling because in both cases there appears to be an overemphasis of the occurrence of the winning event (a jackpot) and an underemphasis of losing events. In the present research we found that pigeons chose suboptimally to the degree that they were impulsive as indexed by the steeper slope of the hyperbolic delay-discounting function (i.e., the shorter the delay they would accept in a smaller-sooner/larger-later procedure). These correlational findings have implications for the mechanisms underlying suboptimal choice by humans (e.g., problem gamblers) and they suggest that high baseline levels of impulsivity can enhance acquisition of a gambling habit. © 2013 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Brucellosis is endemic in the bovine population in India and causes a loss of US$ 3·4 billion to the livestock industry besides having a significant human health impact. Methods: We developed a stochastic simulation model to estimate the impact of three alternative vaccination strategies on the prevalence of Brucella infection in the bovine populations in India for the next two decades: (a) annual mass vaccination only for the replacement calves and (b) vaccination of both the adult and young population at the beginning of the program followed by an annual vaccination of the replacement calves and, (c) annual mass vaccination of replacements for a decade followed by a decade of a test and slaughter strategy. Findings: For all interventions, our results indicate that the prevalence of Brucella infection will drop below 2% in cattle and, below 3% in buffalo after 20 years of the implementation of a disease control program. For cattle, the Net Present Value (NPV) was found to be US $ 4·16 billion for intervention (a), US $ 8·31 billion for intervention (b) and, US $ 4·26 for intervention (c). For buffalo, the corresponding NPVs were US $ 8·77 billion, US $ 13·42 and, US $ 7·66, respectively. The benefit cost ratio (BCR) for the first, second and the third intervention for cattle were 7·98, 10·62 and, 3·16, respectively. Corresponding BCR estimates for buffalo were 17·81, 21·27 and, 3·79, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that all interventions will be cost-effective with the intervention (b), i.e. the vaccination of replacements with mass vaccination at the beginning of the program, being the most cost-effective choice. Further, sensitivity analysis revealed that all interventions will be cost-effective even at the 50% of the current prevalence estimates. The results advocate for the implementation of a disease control program for brucellosis in India. © 2018 Singh et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decision-making in humans is known to be subject to several biases. For instance, when facing bets, humans demonstrate some asymmetry concerning their preference for the riskiest option depending on whether stakes involve potential gains or potential losses. They are indeed risk-averse for bets involving gains but risk seeking for bets involving losses. They also exhibit a distorted perception of probabilities. It is not clear whether non-human primates exhibit the same biases. Setting up a protocol that allowed two rhesus monkeys to make choices between lotteries involving either gains or losses, we demonstrated that rhesus monkeys facing bets exhibited an asymmetry in the treatment of gains and losses comparable with that of humans. © 2019, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The complexity and severity of rare genetic conditions pose substantial burden to families. While the importance of spillovers on carers’ health in resource allocation decisions is increasingly recognised, there is significant lack of empirical evidence in the context of rare diseases. The objective of this study was to estimate the health spillovers of paediatric rare genetic conditions on parents. Methods: Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) data from children with rare genetic conditions (genetic kidney diseases, mitochondrial diseases, epileptic encephalopathies, brain malformations) and their parents were collected using the CHU9D and SF-12 measures, respectively. We used two approaches to estimate parental health spillovers. To quantify the ‘absolute health spillover’, we matched our parent cohort to the Australian general population. To quantify the ‘relative health spillover’, regression models were applied using the cohort data. Results: Parents of affected children had significantly lower HRQoL compared to matched parents in the general public (− 0.06; 95% CIs − 0.08, − 0.04). Multivariable regression demonstrated a positive association between parental and child health. The mean magnitude of HRQoL loss in parents was estimated to be 33% of the HRQoL loss observed in children (95% CIs 21%, 46%). Conclusion: Paediatric rare genetic conditions appear to be associated with substantial parental health spillovers. This highlights the importance of including health effects on family members and caregivers into economic evaluation of genomic technologies and personalised medicine. Overlooking spillover effects may undervalue the benefits of diagnosis and management in this context. This study also expands the knowledge of family spillover to the rare disease spectrum. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Maximum-loss (Max-loss) was recently introduced as a valuation functional in the context of systematic stress testing. The basic idea is to value a (financial) random variable by its worst case expectation, where the most unfavourable probability measure - the 'worst case distribution' - lies within a given Kullback-Leibler radius around a previously estimated distribution. The article gives an overview of the properties of this measure and analyses relations to other risk and acceptability measures and to the well-known Esscher pricing principle, used in insurance mathematics and option pricing. The main part of the article focuses then on optimal decision-making - in particular related to portfolio optimization - with Max-loss as the objective function to be minimized. A simple algorithm for dealing with the resulting saddle point problem is introduced and analysed. The authors 2011.

      "Abstract: Background. Many medical decisions involve an implied choice between alternative survival curves, typically with differing quality of life. Common preference assessment methods neglect this structure, creating some risk of distortions. Methods. Survival curve quality-of-life assessments (SQLA) were developed fromGompertz survival curves fitting the general population's survival. An algorithm was developed to generate relative discount rate-utility (DRU) functions from a standard survival curve and health state and an equally attractive alternative curve and state. A least means squared distance algorithm was developed to describe how nearly 3 or more DRU functions intersect. These techniques were implemented in a program called X-Trade and tested. Results. SQLA scenarios can portray realistic treatment choices. A side effect scenario portrays one prototypical choice, to extend life while experiencing some loss, such as an amputation. A risky treatment scenario portrays procedures with an initial mortality risk. A time trade scenario mimics conventional time tradeoffs. Each SQLA scenario yields DRU functions with distinctive shapes, such as sigmoid curves or vertical lines. One SQLA can imply a discount rate or utility if the other value is known and both values are temporally stable. Two SQLA exercises imply a unique discount rate and utility if the inferred DRU functions intersect. Three or more SQLA results can quantify uncertainty or inconsistency in discount rate and utility estimates. Pilot studies suggested that many subjects could learn to interpret survival curves and do SQLA. Limitations. SQLA confuse some people. Compared with SQLA, standard gambles quantify very low utilities more easily, and time tradeoffs are simpler for high utilities. When discount rates approach zero, time tradeoffs are as informative and easier to do than SQLA. Conclusions. SQLA may complement conventional utility assessment methods. © The Author(s) 2014.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Integrating prospect theory and operational code analysis, this paper introduces an innovative approach to studying the decision making of Chinese leaders during crises. The unique contribution of this paper is to adopt the methodology of operational code analysis to measure the domain of actions of policy makers in the application of prospect theory. We suggest that leaders’ operational code beliefs can help us to identify in which domain of actions (gains or losses) leaders are located during crises. Xi Jinping experienced two notable foreign policy crises in 2014, the ‘oil rig’ crisis with Vietnam and the ‘P-8 crisis’ with the United States, which are examined in detail to illustrate Xi’s operational code beliefs and risk-taking behaviour of ‘confident accommodation’ behaviour during crises. To test the process validity of integrating operational code analysis and prospect theory, Hu Jintao’s operational code beliefs and crisis behaviour in 2011–2012 are then compared to Xi’s beliefs and decisions in this study of China’s crisis behaviour. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Common practises for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) include the estimation of frequencies of releases and related initial causes; these are a function of several parameters such as components failure rates, probabilities of human error, equipment damage and managerial factors. The availability of general values for such parameters from the literature simplifies the work of the risk analyst, but standardised results are provided, which unfortunately do not permit taking into consideration the plant's specificity The specificity of the establishment is defined through its management system, thus if managerial and organisational factors are neglected or not proper assessed, risk analysis for two identical establishments, characterised by totally different management systems, gives the same results and this appears absolutely unacceptable especially when risk analysis is used for risk-based decisions. This paper aims quantifying the effects of managerial and organisational variables on the frequency of losses of containment of pipeworks, by using a simple and flexible method developed by Milazzo and co-authors in 2010. Such a methodology has been tested on a new case-study and the results of the assessment have been evaluated from both the sensitivity and uncertainty points of view.

      "Abstract: The present study investigated the effects of punishing responses inconsistent with rules on instructional control during a choice task. In a procedure modeled after Hackenberg and Joker (1994), 7 adults were presented with repeated choices between progressive-and fixed-time schedules of reinforcement and were given instructions (rules) for how to respond to maximize earnings. Across sessions, the progressive-time schedule step size was manipulated so that the instructions became increasingly inaccurate, and deviating from the instructions produced greater earnings. The experiment consisted of two phases, Penalty and No Penalty. During the Penalty phase, deviating from the instructions produced a money-loss penalty (response-cost punishment). Two participants showed persistent instructional control and therefore completed only one phase (Penalty or No Penalty), and 1 participant showed little instructional control during the Penalty phase until the punishment magnitude was increased. In all 4 participants who experienced both Penalty and No Penalty phases, punishment increased the consistency of choices with the instructions, and in 2 of these participants punishment increased the progressive-schedule step size at which choices began to systematically deviate from the instructions. These results show that monetary penalties for breaking with rules may enhance instructional control, but that deviations from rules still occur under punishment when such deviations produce greater reinforcement than rule following.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: As modern medicine extends the life expectancy of patients with life-limiting illnesses and health system resource pressures intensify, palliative care physicians increasingly need to transfer stable patients from specialist palliative care units to nursing homes. The experience of palliative care physicians in decision-making and communicating with patients and families about the need for this transition is underexplored in the literature. Aim: This study aimed to explore the experiences of and communication techniques used by palliative care physicians as they consider and discuss nursing home placements for their patients. Design: A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews was used. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Setting/participants: Purposive sampling was used to recruit 18 Australian palliative care physicians known for their interest or strength in communication skills across a range of palliative care settings. Results: Themes emerged from domains of physician experience (abandonment, systemic pressures, prognostic uncertainty, exacerbation of loss, and restoring resilience) and communication strategies (forecasting, checking in, provide context, and acknowledging grief). Conclusion: This study highlights the tension Australian palliative care physicians experience when transferring palliative care patients to nursing home and the complexity involved in decision-making. Physicians identified several communication strategies to engage patients and families to ease the transition. © The Author(s) 2019.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many economic analyses fail to incorporate evidence on child health-related quality of life because of a paucity of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) estimates. This health valuation study is the first to summarize the EQ-5D-Y on a QALY scale. Drawn from a nationally representative panel, 5207 adult respondents were asked to choose between two losses in child health-related quality of life. Based on their choices, a 1-year increase in child pain/discomfort from 'some' to 'a lot' equals a loss of 4 QALYs (95% CI, 3.8-4.4). Likewise, a 1-year increase in child anxiety/depression from 'a bit' to 'very worried, sad, or unhappy' equals a loss of 2 QALYs (95% CI, 1.9-2.2). These findings enable the integration of child-reported outcomes with adult preferences to inform economic analysis. Results inform both clinical practice and resource allocation decisions by enhancing understanding of difficult tradeoffs in child-reported outcomes.

This article attempts to clarify what a nudge entails, and critically summarises some of the nudge policies that have been proposed to motivate weight loss in the United Kingdom and the United States. Despite the fact that most of the evidence on nudge-related policy has so far been produced in the United States, and that the leading nudge champions are American, the United Kingdom, at least with respect to considering policy interventions of this kind at the national level, appears to be relatively advanced. That said, nudge interventions remain of marginal practical import everywhere, and are never going to solve completely the obesity problem.

      "Abstract: Objectives: Patient production losses occur when individuals' capacities to work, whether paid or unpaid, are impaired by illness, treatment, disability, or death. Thereis controversy about whether and how to include patient production losses in economic evaluations in health care. Patient production losses have not previously been considered when evaluating medications for reimbursement under the U.K. National Health Service. Proposals for value-based assessment of health technologies in the United Kingdom created renewed interest in whether and how to include costs from a wider societal perspective, such as patient production losses, within economic evaluation of healthcare interventions. Methods: A narrative review was undertaken of theoretical, ethical, and policy issues that might inform decisions that involve the normative question of whether or not to include patient production losses in economic evaluation. Results: It seems difficult to reconcile the implications of including patient production losses with the objectives of a healthcare system dedicated to providing universal healthcare coverage without regard to patients' ability to pay. Conclusions: Tax payer funded healthcare systems may legitimately adopt maximands other than health gain, but these will be at the opportunity cost of less than maximum health gains. © Cambridge University Press 2017.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Upper limb loss is a devastating condition with dramatic physical, psychological, financial, and social consequences. Improvements in the fields of prosthetics and vascularized composite allotransplantation have opened exciting new frontiers for treatment and rehabilitation following upper limb loss. Each modality offers a unique set of advantages and limitations with regard to the restoration of hand function following amputation. Methods: Presented in this article is a discussion outlining the complex considerations and decisions encountered when determining patient appropriateness for either prosthetic rehabilitation or vascularized composite allotransplantation following upper limb loss. In this review, the authors examine how psychosocial factors, nature of injury, rehabilitation course, functional outcomes, and risks and benefits may affect overall patient selection for either rehabilitative approach. Results: This review summarizes the current state of the literature. Advancements in both prosthetic and biological strategies demonstrate promise with regard to facilitating rehabilitation following upper limb loss. However, there remains a dearth of research directly comparing outcomes in prosthetic rehabilitation to that following upper extremity transplantation. Conclusions: Few studies have performed a direct comparison between patients undergoing vascularized composite allotransplantation and those undergoing prosthetic rehabilitation. Upper extremity transplantation and prosthetic reconstruction should not be viewed as competing options, but rather as two treatment modalities with different risk-to-benefit profiles and indications. © 2019 by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons\u001b[0m :\n",

While reference dependence is extensively studied, very little is known regarding the impact of reference points on individual choice behavior when the reference points themselves are not chosen (Reference Effect). We identify critical properties that differentiate between classes of reference-dependent models and test them. We find that the reference effect exists for asymmetrically dominated reference points, but we do not see any evidence of a reference effect for symmetrically dominated reference points. Some of the existing models are mostly consistent with our data but lack predictive power. None of the models offers the particular predictions that our experiment suggests. Finally, we also tease apart the differences between the reference effect and the asymmetric dominance effect (decoy effect), a well-known phenomenon observed in the literature on context-dependent choice. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective. Previous neuroimaging studies have described altered activity in brain areas associated with reward processing following reward or punishment. This study examines the extent to which feedback-based experience of gain and loss is associated with electrophysiological correlates. Methods. Twenty-nine healthy participants used a gambling task that focused on actual nonpredictable gains and losses. During the task, an electroencephalography recording was performed in order to assess reward processing. Event-related potentials were analyzed when participants were receiving gain/loss feedback. Results. Event-related potentials revealed higher feedback-related negativity for both overall gain and loss compared with a neutral condition in fronto-centro-parietal electrodes. P3 potentials were significantly increased for high gains/losses compared to neutral and small gains/losses. Conclusion. These results indicate that the paradigm is suitable to evoke specific patterns of reward-related electrophysiological responses. The wavelet analysis showed that electroencephalography frequency variations depended on the amount of gains/losses. Significance. This gambling paradigm is appropriate to measure aspects of feedback processing and could help analyze disease-specific alterations of the reward system in patients. © EEG and Clinical Neuroscience Society (ECNS)2018.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One of the best-researched anomalies in behavioral sciences is loss aversion, but with strong study variations and no systematic explanations thereof. The aim here was to introduce psychophysiological correlates for loss aversion to improve behavioral predictability. In an endowment experiment, a loss versus gain framing was implemented for a virtue versus a vice product. In addition to the classical price elicitation, an area of indifference and individual price reactions were examined, while emotional arousal as skin conductance levels were continuously measured. Furthermore, various heterogeneity measures for emotions and product experience evaluations were applied directly after the purchasing decision or as a more general personality measure at the end of the study. Results show fundamental regularities of product and frame on the price or the size of indifference. Physiologically measured emotional arousal further supports the dependence of loss aversion. Vice products and a loss frame increase emotional arousal and the consumer purchase price indifference. Reported emotions, aggregated as personality factors, can partially explain the observed heterogeneity in purchase price levels and price indifferences. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Findings from previous studies of individual decision-making behavior predict that losses will loom larger than gains. It is less clear, however, if this loss aversion applies to the way in which individuals attribute value to the gains and losses of others, or if it is robust across a broad spectrum of policy and management decision contexts. Consistent with previous work, the results from a series of experiments reported here revealed that subjects exhibited loss aversion when evaluating their own financial gains and losses. The presence of loss aversion was also confirmed for the way in which individuals attribute value to the financial gains and losses of others. However, similar evaluations within social and environmental contexts did not exhibit loss aversion. In addition, research subjects expected that individuals who were unknown to them would significantly undervalue the subjects' own losses across all contexts. The implications of these findings for risk-based policy and management are many. Specifically, they warrant caution when relying upon loss aversion to explain or predict the reaction of affected individuals to risk-based decisions that involve moral or protected values. The findings also suggest that motivational biases may lead decisionmakers to assume that their attitudes and beliefs are common among those affected by a decision, while those affected may expect unfamiliar others to be unable to identify and act in accordance with shared values. © 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Planning initiative on the part of individual groups and communities within urban areas has been made necessary by the increasing bureaucratization and technical basis of decisions in current urban society. The efforts of advocate planners to represent these groups are made difficult because of their frequent lack of homogeneity, community feeling, and common interests in action. The treatment of local areas as “communities” of homogeneous interests can result in severe damage to the interest of their weakest inhabitants. Further, it is difficult to draw low-income families into the framework of planning, and to evoke their concern for the planning issues normally posed by the local establishment. Thus it is necessary to carefully generate viable issues in the work and maintain a consciousness of the interrelation of technical and political matters at all levels. The advocate planner's need to evoke and formulate issues maizes him dangerously similar to other manipulators of the poor's interests. One of the most difficult kinds of issues is the type like transportation which, although generated at the community level, must be studied and argued at the metropolitan scale with the consequent loss of a clearly identified client group. Advocacy planning takes many forms depending on its sponsorship. In spite of its problems, it fills a crucial need for managing latent conflict in the cities and for humanizing public action. © 1968 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The studies presented here were aimed at answering the following questions: do voluntary migrants, when deciding to cross borders illegally, take into account the risk of losing their life, how much they fear it, and whether personality traits, such as sensation seeking or self-esteem and culture worldview, are associated with the fear of death. The research covered 16 voluntary migrants. A psychological interview and observation were used. Attempts were made to explain the fear of death and the related behaviours of migrants on the basis of two theories: sensation seeking theory by M. Zuckerman and terror management theory by Greenberg, Pyszczynski and Solomon. It turned out that the subjects rarely considered the risk of losing health or life on their way to the EU, and the level of fear of death was low, especially in men. The existence of relationships between the level of anxiety and sensation seeking, self-esteem and worldview has been noticed. The level of fear in women can be explained by their age, life experience, way of making decisions and awareness of dangers along the route to the UE. Women thought about passing away more often because they encountered the death of their relatives more often. Men often made decisions on an impulse. The contemplating death, second aspect of the thanatological attitude was absent in them. They had higher self-esteem than women, a more stable culture worldview, and a higher sensation seeking and propensity for risky behavior. These personality traits may have diminished the fear of death. © 2022 Polish Psychiatric Association. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Sense of agency, the feeling of having control over one’s actions, is modulated by whether one’s choices lead to desired or undesired outcomes. Learning similarly depends on outcome values from previous experience. In the current study, we evaluate a possible link between the sense of agency and learning, by investigating how intentional binding, an implicit measure of agency, changes during a probabilistic learning task. In two experiments, we show increased intentional binding in trials that follow losses, compared with trials that follow wins. Experiment 1 demonstrated that this post-error agency boost (PEAB) effect is rule-specific, as it did not occur if the trial following an error involved different action–outcome contingencies. Furthermore, PEAB was not modulated by the type of outcome presentation (monetary vs. affective). Experiment 2 showed that the PEAB effect can also occur when the current action involves a forced (as opposed to free) choice, but only when the previous, loss-provoking action was chosen freely. Thus, PEAB occurs when current actions are informed by outcomes of one’s own previous action choices. Electroencephalography (EEG) data linked these effects to two event-related potential components, namely, the Feedback Related Negativity and the P300. Taken together, these results support the notion that PEAB reflects an adaptive property of human sense of agency, facilitating effective learning about the action–outcome structure of a specific task, to optimise future performance. By clarifying the conditions for enhancing the sense of agency through learning, this work adds to our understanding of human learning and agency. © Experimental Psychology Society 2020.\u001b[0m :\n",

To prevent any accidental loss or harm to human life and property, a safety risk assessment method is needed to perform the continuous risk assessment of mines. Based on the requirements of mine safety evaluation, this paper proposes the Pb-Zn mine safety risk evaluation model based on the fuzzy-grey correlation analysis method. The model is compared with the risk assessment model based on the fuzzy TOPSIS method. Through the experiments, our results demonstrate that the proposed fuzzy-grey correlation model is more sensitive to risk and has less effect on the evaluation results under different scoring attitudes (cautious, rational, and relaxed). © 2020 by the authors.

No influence was detected on the general activity and motivation after tooth loss. Recent experiments have shown that decision-making performances in the RGT rely on the functional integrity of the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The theta band brain oscillation has been acknowledged for extensive cognitive functions. Here, we performed multiple-electrode array recordings of local field potential (LFP) in anesthetized rats. The results exhibited an increase in accumulative power of the theta frequency of LFP in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and decrease of theta power in the ACC in tooth loss rats. Furthermore, cross-correlation analysis displayed that tooth loss suppressed the synchronization of theta frequency of LFP between the BLA and ACC, indicating reduced neuronal communications between these two regions. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that tooth loss leads to higher-order cognitive deficits accompanied by the alteration of theta frequency of LFP in brain circuitries and disruption of neural network integrity. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A solution to any problem is valuable only if the results of the solution are reliable. This axiomatic statement is trivial. However, despite the fact that this statement is undeniable, it is violated regularly in problems of operations research. This is due to the fact that the proposed evaluation criteria are not verified and possibility of using indirect methods of effectiveness evaluation of operations is not substantiated. The problem point of modeling was shown using the example of comparison of operational processes, based on equally effective operations with multiple duration. This point is related to the fact that it is necessary to take into account inter-operational losses while modeling the process, based on the use of shorter operations in relation to an alternative operational process. Ignoring these losses can lead to making a mistaken decision or to errors in verification of estimation indicators. In a number of cases the problem can be solved using specially conducted experimental studies. However, if there is a set of unveri- fied estimation expressions or in verification problems, a formal approach can be used. Under this approach, uncertainty, arising in the process of modeling, can be removed by using the capabilities of a verified indicator itself. The developed method for modeling allows us to determine the scope of constraints on parameters of modeled operations. The probability of an error in results of modeling in problems, related to decision making, is excluded on condition of taking into account this region. © I. Lutsenko, I. Oksanych, I. Shevchenko, N.

      "Abstract: The study was carried out to estimate classical swine fever (CSF) outbreak-related outcomes, such as epidemic duration and number of infected, vaccinated, and depopulated premises, using defined most likely CSF outbreak scenarios. Risk metrics were established using empirical data to select the most likely CSF outbreak scenarios in Indiana. These scenarios were simulated using a stochastic between-premises disease spread model to estimate outbreak-related outcomes. A total of 19 single-site (i.e., with one index premises at the onset of an outbreak) and 15 multiple-site (i.e., with more than one index premises at the onset of an outbreak) outbreak scenarios of CSF were selected using the risk metrics. The number of index premises in the multiple-site outbreak scenarios ranged from 4 to 32. The multiple-site outbreak scenarios were further classified into clustered (N = 6) and non-clustered (N = 9) groups. The estimated median (5th, 95th percentiles) epidemic duration (days) was 224 (24, 343) in the single-site and was 190 (157, 251) and 210 (167, 302) in the clustered and non-clustered multiple-site outbreak scenarios, respectively. The median (5th, 95th percentiles) number of infected premises was 323 (0, 488) in the single-site outbreak scenarios and was 529 (395, 662) and 465 (295, 640) in the clustered and non-clustered multiple-site outbreak scenarios, respectively. Both the number and spatial distributions of the index premises affected the outcome estimates. The results also showed the importance of implementing vaccinations to accommodate depopulation in the CSF outbreak controls. The use of routinely collected surveillance data in the risk metrics and disease spread model allows end users to generate timely outbreak-related information based on the initial outbreak's characteristics. Swine producers can use this information to make an informed decision on the management of swine operations and continuity of business, so that potential losses could be minimized during a CSF outbreak. Government authorities might use the information to make emergency preparedness plans for CSF outbreak control. © 2016 Yadav, Olynk Widmar and Weng.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Factors affecting emergence by prey that enter refuges when approached by predators have been studied intensively, but only two theoretical models predict how long prey should remain in a refuge before emerging. We argue that prey can make better decisions than allowed by one model; the other model describes cases in which predators wait for prey to emerge. We present optimality models that permit prey to select a time to emerge that maximizes fitness. When in a refuge, a prey cannot obtain benefits outside; emerging too soon can be catastrophic, but delaying emergence entails loss of fitness. If predators resume foraging quickly rather than engaging in strategic waiting games, current theory suggests that prey emerge when the costs of remaining in a refuge and of emerging are equal. However, prey often can do better by emerging at the time maximizing fitness rather than when benefits equal costs (i.e. when prey break even). Optimal emergence time depends on initial fitness, benefits lost by remaining in refuge, and the decay rate of predation risk. Benefits lost if a prey is killed are modelled separately from benefits that contribute to lifetime fitness, even if the prey is killed (individual reproduction, altruism). Fitness of prey emerging at the optimal emergence time may be greater than, equal to or less than initial fitness. Break-even and optimality models base predictions on the opposing effects of risk and loss of benefits. Thus, many empirically verified predictions are identical at the ordinal level although differing quantitatively. Optimality models provide novel testable predictions for the effects of initial fitness, benefits, and, for ectotherms, the rate of cooling in refuge. They predict earlier emergence for equal retainable benefits than for those lost upon death. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: This study examined the clinical significance of loss of control (LOC) over eating in bariatric surgery patients over 24 months of prospective, multiwave follow-ups. Method: Three hundred sixty-one gastric bypass surgery patients completed a battery of assessments before surgery and at 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. In addition to weight loss and LOC over eating, the assessments targeted eating disorder psychopathology, depression levels, and quality of life. The study was conducted between January 2002 and February 2008. Results: Prior to surgery, 61% of patients reported general LOC; postsurgery, 31% reported LOC at 6-month follow-up, 36% reported LOC at 12-month follow-up, and 39% reported LOC at 24-month follow-up. Preoperative LOC did not predict postoperative outcomes. In contrast, mixed models analyses revealed that postsurgery LOC was predictive of weight loss outcomes: patients with LOC postsurgery lost significantly less weight at 12-month (34.6% vs 37.2% BMI loss) and 24-month (35.8% vs 39.1% BMI loss) postsurgery follow-ups. Postsurgery LOC also significantly predicted eating disorder psychopathology, depression, and quality of life at 12- and 24-month postsurgery follow-ups. Conclusions: Preoperative LOC does not appear to be a negative prognostic indicator for postsurgical outcomes. Postoperative LOC, however, significantly predicts poorer postsurgical weight loss and psychosocial outcomes at 12 and 24 months following surgery. Since LOC following bariatric surgery significantly predicts attenuated postsurgical improvements, it may signal a need for clinical attention. © Copyright 2010 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Public-private partnership (PPP) models for public infrastructure delivery are becoming popular among government institutions around the world, due to their embedded potential value for money (VFM) to the public and governments themselves. The experience with infrastructure PPPs internationally have demonstrated many problems and partnership failures, where both the public and private sectors suffered huge losses. Motivated by a number of these failures, this study investigates the actions and decisions of private-sector partners by evaluating 35 failed transportation PPPs around the world. This paper identifies a set of drivers responsible for the failures of transportation PPPs, discusses the causal relationships between them, and finally evaluates a set of failure mechanisms initiated by the private-sector partners. It sheds light on the role of private-sector partners in terms of triggering failure mechanisms in transportation PPP failures. The identification of failure mechanisms discloses the fact that inappropriate decisions and actions of private-sector partners (i.e., failure drivers) have created problems for other project partners, which ultimately caused the PPP failures. The failure mechanism model suggested here provides insight into the existing failure trends associated with private-sector partners in transportation PPPs. These findings will help private-sector partners to safeguard partnerships more effectively and provide public-sector PPP practitioners with a better understanding of their partners' actions and decisions and their influence on project success. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: As flood risk is projected to increase, effective flood risk management (FRM) is crucial not only for mitigating direct flood damage but also for contributing to the long-term improvement of livelihoods and hence the socioeconomic development of flood-prone areas in developing countries. While many studies have assessed avoided damage as the benefit of flood countermeasures, few recognize the impact on improvements in livelihood resulting from risk reduction. We present a novel framework that captures the dynamic relationship between decreasing flood risk perception and improvements in household livelihoods. Using the case of flood-prone Bago, Myanmar, we apply this framework to evaluate 127 flood management strategies under different assumptions of future climate change and socioeconomic features. We show that the benefits of improved livelihoods, when quantified alongside avoided flood losses, have a significant impact enough to change the cost-efficiency rankings of flood management strategies. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating livelihood improvements into FRM decision making to promote the sustainable development in flood-prone areas. © 2024 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Despite Bangladesh's great strides in formulating disaster management policies following the principles of good governance, the degree to which these policies have successfully been implemented at the local level remains largely unknown. The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to examine the roles and effectiveness of local-level governance and disaster management institutions, and (2) to identify barriers to the implementation of national policies and Disaster-Risk-Reduction (DRR) guidelines at the local community level. Design/methodology/approach: Between January 2014 and June 2015 we carried out an empirical investigation in two coastal communities in Bangladesh. We employed a qualitative research and Case Study approach, using techniques from the Participatory Rural Appraisal toolbox to collect data from local community members as well as government and NGO officials. Findings: Our study revealed that interactive disaster governance, decentralization of disaster management, and compliance by local-level institutions with good governance principles and national policy guidelines can be extremely effective in reducing disaster-loss and damages. According to coastal community members, the local governments have generally failed to uphold good governance principles, and triangulated data confirm that the region at large suffers from rampant corruption, political favoritism, lack of transparency and accountability and minimal inclusion of local inhabitants in decision-making – all of which have severely impeded the successful implementation of national disaster-management policies. Research limitations/implications: While considerable research on good governance has been pursued, our understanding of good disaster governance and their criteria is still poor. In addition, although numerous national disaster management policy and good governance initiatives have been taken in Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, the nature and extent of their local level implementation are not well known. This study contributes to these research gaps, with identification of further research agenda in these areas. Practical implications: The study focuses on good disaster governance and management issues and practices, their strengths and limitations in the context of cyclone and storm surges along coastal Bangladesh. It offers specific good disaster governance criteria for improving multi-level successful implementation. The paper deals with International Sendai Framework that called for enhancement of local level community resilience to disasters. Thus, it contributes to numerous policy and practice areas relating to good disaster governance. Social implications: Good disaster governance would benefit not only from future disaster losses but also from improved prevention and mitigation of natural hazards impact, benefiting society at large. Improvement in knowledge and practice in disaster-risk-reduction through good governance and effective management would ensure local community development and human wellbeing at the national level. Originality/value: The failure of local-level government institutions to effectively implement national disaster management and resilience-building policies is largely attributable to a lack of financial and human resources, rampant corruption, a lack of accountability and transparency and the exclusion of local inhabitants from decision-making processes. Our study identified the specific manifestations of these failures in coastal communities in Bangladesh. These results underscore the vital need to address the wide gap between national DRR goals and the on-the-ground realities of policy implementation to successfully enhance the country's resilience to climate change-induced disasters. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We present a model of reference dependence for riskless choice, in which we assume that reference points affect choice by directing the decision maker's attention toward the particular attributes associated with the reference object. This model makes no assumptions about the curvature of utility and does not assume a built-in asymmetry in gains and losses. Nonetheless it is able to generate a type of loss aversion and can explain behavioral anomalies related to reference dependence. In addition, the model makes a number of novel predictions that differentiate it from existing accounts of reference dependence and can easily be extended to predict instances of choice set dependence and anchoring effects. Sensibly, for decisions about economic goods, the model implies acyclic sequential choices and any sequence of short-sighted referencedependent decisions is guaranteed to converge to a stable personal equilibrium. © 2018 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: As information technologies and the Internet have rapidly evolved, businesses have begun to use them to improve communication efficiency within and outside the organization. However, applications of information technologies are accompanied by information delivery, personal data protection, and information security problems. There are potential risks inherent in any application of information technologies. Moreover, with the improvement of networking and computing capabilities, the impact of attacks from hackers and malicious software has also increased. A breach or leakage of important corporate data may not only damage the firm’s image but also sabotage the firm’s operation, resulting in financial losses. In this study, the content of information security news reports was analyzed in an attempt to clarify the association between information security news and corporate stock prices. Methods including decision trees, support vector machines (SVMs), and random forests were used to explore the associations of news related variables with abnormal returns. Results indicate that the news source and the presence of negative words in the news have an impact on abnormal returns. © 2019 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Rational choice theory in criminology is based on a model of decision-making, expected utility theory (EUT), that research in psychology and economics has shown to be descriptively inaccurate for many types of human decisions. Because of its ability to account for intuitive reasoning and anomalies in crime decisions, prospect theory (PT) may be a viable alternative to EUT for explaining criminal choices. The present study tests several hypotheses derived from PT about the effects of framing, reference dependence, and decision weights in crime decisions. We present findings from a series of survey-based experiments conducted with three different samples. The results support our hypotheses derived from EUT, but not those from PT. We find that although initial wealth, criminal benefits, and arrest risk impact offender decision-making, sanction-cost frames and gains/losses from monetary reference points have little if any effect.

The current literature describes the involvement of child abuse pediatrics after patients are already engaged with pediatric palliative care (PPC). Here we describe a case of an infant who suffered injuries after nonaccidental trauma (NAT) and the subsequent role of PPC. In the case described, PPC was consulted in the context of a grave neurological prognosis after NAT.

      "Abstract: On a gambling task that models real-life decisions, patients with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VM) opt for choices that yield high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. In this study, we addressed three possibilities that may account for this behaviour: (i) hypersensitivity to reward; (ii) insensitivity to punishment; and (iii) insensitivity to future consequences, such that behaviour is always guided by immediate prospects. For this purpose, we designed a variant of the original gambling task in which the advantageous decks yielded high immediate punishment but even higher future reward. The disadvantageous decks yielded low immediate punishment but even lower future reward. We measured the skin conductance responses (SCRs) of subjects after they had received a reward or punishment. Patients with VM lesions opted for the disadvantageous decks in both the original and variant versions of the gambling task. The SCRs of VM lesion patients after they had received a reward or punishment were not significantly different from those of controls. In a second experiment, we investigated whether increasing the delayed punishment in the disadvantageous decks of the original task or decreasing the delayed reward in the disadvantageous decks of the variant task would shift the behaviour of VM lesion patients towards an advantageous strategy. Both manipulations failed to shift the behaviour of VM lesion patients away from the disadvantageous decks. These results suggest that patients with VM lesions are insensitive to future consequences, positive or negative, and are primarily guided by immediate prospects. This 'myopia for the future' in VM lesion patients persists in the face of severe adverse consequences, i.e. rising future punishment or declining future reward.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Opportunity costs of environmental regulations (OCER) are an important consideration when governments make decisions on the formulation of environmental policies and when plants make decisions in response to environmental policies. Aimed at measuring OCER, the current paper proposes an approach in which the achievements of environmental control implemented by a production unit are considered. We quantify and define the achievements as «desirable» environmental outputs. In this way, for a production unit, producing normal desirable outputs and reaching environmental outputs is a tradeoff. OCER is measured by calculating a maximum amount of increasable normal outputs when production units do not need to produce any environmental outputs. Directional distance functions and data envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques are used to calculate OCER. The approach is applied to an empirical illustration based on Taiwan's port industry covering the period 2001-2007. It is found that the industry incurred opportunity costs due to environmental regulations equivalent to 1.8% of total revenue it creates. However, the OCER are significantly less than the economic losses due to productive inefficiency (PIE). © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Co. & Operational Research Society of Singapore.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The decision to negotiate a civil law dispute involves little risk, whereas the decision to go to trial is a risky alternative. Prospect theory predicts that when individuals must choose between such alternatives, they will either (a) be biased toward the risk-free alternative in a gain frame (i.e., when they perceive both prospects as gains), or (b) be biased toward the risky alternative in a loss frame. The decision of the plaintiff to either continue negotiations or go to trial is typically done in a gain frame; the defendant has to choose between losses. Thus, it was hypothesized that plaintiffs are risk aversive and defendants risk seeking in negotiations. Alternatively, it was hypothesized that parties who expect to prevail at trial are risk aversive, and parties who expect to lose are risk seeking. In four experiments, with both laymen and law students as subjects, the first hypothesis received some support, and the second hypothesis was strongly supported. © 1990 Plenum Publishing Corporation.\u001b[0m :\n",

Valuations that can be applied for evaluating policies to improve perceived security are obtained. Consistent results are achieved, indicating that the method is promising for incorporating aspects in the physical environment in the welfare analysis. The results indicate a systematic variation in value of walk time in different physical environments and it is more dependent of the physical environment for women than for men. This paper thereby contributes to the literature by showing that results by social sciences can be verified using methods and theories traditionally used in transport and welfare analysis and may therefore be incorporated in standard CBA. A contribution of this study is the insight that the perception of insecurity involved in accessing the public transport system is a welfare loss that can be quantified. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general modeling framework for operational risk management of financial firms. We consider operational risk events as shocks to a financial firm's value process and then study capital investments under preventive and corrective controls to mitigate risk losses. The optimal decisions are made in three scenarios: (i) preventive control only, (ii) corrective control only, and (iii) joint controls. We characterize the optimal control policies within a general modeling framework that comprises these three scenarios and then discuss an exponential risk reduction function. We conclude our work with an application of our model to a data set from a commercial bank. We find that, through a proper investment strategy, we can achieve a significant performance improvement, especially when the risk severity level is high. Moreover, with controls, the value of the firm tends to increase relative to the value of the firm without controls. Hence, the controls are essentially smoothing out the jump losses and increasing the value of the firm. At the bank we analyze we find that with a joint control strategy the bank can achieve profit increases from 7.45% to 11.62% when the risk reduction efficiencies of the two controls are high. In general, our modeling framework, which combines a typical operational risk process with stochastic control, may suggest a new research direction in operations management and operational risk management.

      "Abstract: In the neoliberal era, competing to host global sporting events has become a prominent urban promotion strategy, and with a few exceptions, the scholarly focus has been on the western experience. In contrast, this paper focuses on the south experience with specific reference to the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa and the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. A common argument is that such sporting events provide global marketing opportunities that can attract foreign investment, which may serve as catalysts for development. A key goal is to promote the status and power of the post-colonial nation-state (although ironically ceding sovereignty to entities like FIFA for the duration of events). While there are some benefits, especially in terms of infrastructure development, the Indian, Brazilian and South African experience suggests that the privileged tend to benefit at the expense of the poor, and socio-economic inequalities were exacerbated. These points are illustrated in this paper with reference to evictions, loss of livelihoods and violations of human rights. Disturbingly, the cost of constructing new sports’ facilities and associated infrastructure escalated phenomenally from the original bid-document estimates, without any public oversight, and some are destined to be white elephants. The mega-events were largely organised and funded by the governments in consultation with the private sector, with little or no accountability to citizens, although such decisions had major implications in terms of the diversion of public spending priorities from more urgent social needs such as housing, healthcare and education. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Grief is one's reaction to any loss, and the coping mechanisms during grief either deplete or become maladaptive. One of the common ways to cope with grief is alcohol or substance intake. The course and resolution of grief vary depending upon many factors. Hypnotherapy has been useful and effective in addressing grief reactions as well as associated manifestation, such as sleep problems, depressive features, or post-traumatic stress disorder. It might be a good choice of treatment while dealing with patients having underlying issues or maladaptive coping mechanisms. This is a single case study design hypothesized to indicate maladaptive coping of increased alcohol consumption to deal with the death of a young son. The case had been treated as alcohol dependent syndrome with multiple hospitalizations without addressing underlying grief. The treatment approach was changed, and grief was addressed using hypnotherapy. Clinical hypnotherapy helped address grief and facilitated the index case to accept the loss. This resulted in minimizing hospitalizations, abstinence and improved day-to-day functioning along with the use of adaptive mechanisms to cope with the loss. Clinical hypnotherapy is an effective intervention to deal with underlying conflicts or issues that may not be addressed directly in a therapy setting. © 2019 Indian Psychiatric Society - South Zonal Branch Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In Ratnapura monsoonal flooding is a chronic problem of which the residents are acutely aware. Responses to structured interviews indicated that a wide range of actions are employed to reduce flood impact, although these actions are not perceived as specific adjustments to flooding. The only widely acknowledged means of mitigating the flood threat is government action. Dependency on government action reflects the government's role in dispensing aid to flood victims. While relief programmes do reduce personal, short-term losses, they simultaneously encourage resettlement in high-risk areas. In seeking a viable, long-term management policy, the Sri Lankan government recently adopted a plan to move the municipality of Ratnapura to invulnerable high ground. In making the decision to relocate, however, the attitudes of the residents were not evaluated, and government officials seemed unconcerned that residents viewed relocation as an unacceptable solution to the problem. Although individual attitudes concerning residential satisfaction in the context of the flood hazard varied with factors such as income, length of residency and land tenure, an overwhelming number of residents adamantly maintained that they would not move to the new town. © 1984.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Inefficiencies in blood product management systems, including segmented operations, lack of detailed data sharing, and limited real-time visibility, can often result in significant annual losses in product wastage and postponed medical procedures. Left unaddressed, the negative impact on patient health and healthcare systems can be substantial as blood donations continue to decline. This paper proposes the Cooperative Blood Inventory Ledger (CoBIL), a blockchain and smart-contract enabled system designed to mitigate some of these inefficiencies by increasing cooperation among all echelons of the blood supply chain, without sacrificing entity privacy and competition. The proposed framework facilitates collaborative decision-making among all stakeholders to distribute blood products across healthcare networks and reduce system costs. It also facilitates product redistribution among hospitals and other transfusion points to reduce losses due to expired product or canceled medical procedures due to product shortages. A role-based smart contract is included in the framework to define stakeholder access and manage data exchange. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed framework, we implement a proof of concept on a local machine using Hyperledger fabric's test network and employ it to simulate transactions required for the inventory operations of a regional blood supply chain. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Moral hazards are said to occur when one party makes decisions that have potential negative consequences that will either be fully or partially experienced by another party. The present experiment sought to explore moral hazard in a laboratory setting. Participants made choices between certain and risky rewards. On some trials, participants bore the full brunt of a loss if the risky reward was chosen and lost. On other trials, participants believed losses would be shared with another party creating the opportunity for moral hazard. Our design allowed us to measure whether the presence of a moral hazard influenced participants' choice behavior and to quantify the magnitude of this influence. Results suggested that participants were more tolerant of risk when they believed losses would be shared with another party compared to choices when all of the loss would be experienced personally. More importantly, concern for the third party losses appeared to exert no influence on choices whatsoever. These results were found when the third party was anonymous (Experiment 1) but also when they met the third party face-to-face (Experiment 2). The relationship between the current results and real-life moral hazards, as well as possible future research directions, is discussed. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Any product outsourcing expands the geological boundaries of production industries under the global supply chain management. The global outsourcing increases concerns for production industries, which is less for domestic supply chain management. Two main strategy makings for product outsourcing under the global supply chain are the proper information about products and services for those products. This study examines a service-driven digital global supply chain management to find intriguing factors for product outsourcing decision-making with international tax, dollar rate, and tariff. The flexible production & the production–transportation lead time of manufacturers and two-stage safety factors of retailers are features of the digital global supply chain. Manufacturers develop a new investment strategy on radio frequency identification technology for product information sharing with retailers. Both manufacturers and retailers pay carbon tax for all products along with transportation for the environmental development. A classical optimization technique finds the global optimum profit of the global supply chain management. Numerical results establish service and safety stock of products as two decision-making factors for digital global supply chain management. The profit is high when retailers are situated in a low-economy country with high service. Retailers in a high-economy country with no service cause a 57.98% loss than the original profit. This phenomenon justifies that local customers can put their trust in buying imported products when they are sure about product-related services. Comparison, discussions, and sensitivity analysis are provided for a detailed result analysis. © 2024\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Study results contribute to the recreation benefits literature for the sport of rock climbing. Also, reported is an application of a hybrid or trip response modeling approach. Respondent reactions (intended behavior) to regulatory changes in management plans at Crowder's Mountain State Park, North Carolina, are assessed. The proposed regulations address (a) the quality of rock climbing conditions, (b) variations in climbing areas to accommodate the different skill levels, (c) limiting the number and size of groups, (d) rationing of rock climbing at certain areas, involving either area modifications, restrictions or closures, and (e) requiring users to attend education programs and perform park service projects. Intended changes in annual climbing participation, attributable to the proposed regulations, are displayed along with losses in recreation benefits. Our point estimate of consumer surplus is $125 per trip, which compares favorably with other reported estimates. Finally, an on-site climbing choice model is estimated and the resulting distributions of demanded state park trips among the seven climbing areas resulting from four regulatory change are evaluated.

      "Abstract: The Brexit referendum confronted British voters with a choice that could have profound consequences for the British economy in a context of high uncertainty. Drawing on important lessons from prospect theory, I argue that citizens who were in the domain of economic losses were more likely to take a risk and vote in favor of Brexit. On the contrary, I hold that citizens who were in the domain of economic gains tended to be more risk averse and were more likely to support ‘Remain’ in the referendum. Using data from several waves of the British Election Study 2014–2019 Internet Panel, I find strong support for these theoretical expectations. British voters who lived in declining areas were significantly more likely to think that leaving the EU would lead to improvements in the national economy. These prospective economic evaluations (captured about a month prior to the referendum) in turn are related to the ‘Leave’ vote in the Brexit referendum. © 2019\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decision-making deficits in clinical populations are often assessed with the Iowa gambling task (IGT). Performance on this task is driven by latent psychological processes, the assessment of which requires an analysis using cognitive models. Two popular examples of such models are the Expectancy Valence (EV) and Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) models. These models have recently been subjected to sophisticated procedures of model checking, spawning a hybrid version of the EV and PVL models-the PVL-Delta model. In order to test the validity of the PVL-Delta model we present a parameter space partitioning (PSP) study and a test of selective influence. The PSP study allows one to assess the choice patterns that the PVL-Delta model generates across its entire parameter space. The PSP study revealed that the model accounts for empirical choice patterns featuring a preference for the good decks or the decks with infrequent losses; however, the model fails to account for empirical choice patterns featuring a preference for the bad decks. The test of selective influence investigates the effectiveness of experimental manipulations designed to target only a single model parameter. This test showed that the manipulations were successful for all but one parameter. To conclude, despite a few shortcomings, the PVL-Delta model seems to be a better IGT model than the popular EV and PVL models. © 2013 Steingroever, Wetzels and Wagenmakers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article provides an evaluation of the commercial viability of the suborbital tourism market while considering the large uncertainties in the current demand predictions. Since it is unlikely that future demand forecasts will be significantly more precise, an analysis that takes these uncertainties into account is needed. Our study addresses this problem by using a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the distribution of possible results in commercial terms (net present value [NPV] developed from a discounted cash flow analysis). By conducting a sensitivity analysis, we identify the most impactful factors in development and create a probability distribution of their uncertainties. Previous work done by the authors defined a design space of 33 suborbital vehicle architecture from which we picked for the purpose of this article optimal architecture number 4 with 1 pilot (this is the same architecture as XCOR's Lynx). Data from studies are used to model the distribution of the demand and its uncertainty. The cost model is mainly based on cost estimation relationships from one study. We implement several decision rules to simulate 5 different commercial strategies a company in this sector might have. We found that there are 2 dominant commercial strategies: a riskier strategy with an aggressive fleet expansion with a large vehicle (16 participants, average expected NPV is $2.8 billion, 41% chance of incurring losses) and a less risky strategy with a neutral fleet expansion and a medium vehicle (4 participants, average expected NPV is $2 billion, 33% chance of incurring losses). We conclude that the suborbital tourism market can probably be made commercially attractive by proper management of development, even in the face of significant uncertainty. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The death of a child may result in traumatizing forms of grief, and meaning-making coping with loss seems to be important in prevention of intense psychosocial problems among bereaved parents. The aim of this quantitative pilot study was to discover the divergent meaning-making coping methods used by bereaved parents in Sweden. In doing so, 162 respondents were selected using a convenience sampling method, and they responded to the modified version of RCOPE. The study revealed that the strategies talking to others about their feelings, pondering the meaning of life alone, and being in nature for greater emotional affiliation, i.e., what we call secular existential coping methods, have been the most used meaning-making coping methods among Swedish mourning parents. While explaining the results, we considered the respondents’ cultural background and speculated about the potential influence of cultural teachings and elements in the selection of ways of coping with bereavement. Further, we compared the results obtained with those of the two other Swedish studies conducted among people coping with cancer and COVID-19 to further discuss the impact of culture on coping with illness, loss, grief, and crisis. The study supports the idea that culture plays an essential role in the choice of coping methods. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper analyzes the utility calculation principle of travelers from the perspective of mental accounting and proposes a travel choice behavior model that considers travel time and cost (MA-TC model). Then, a questionnaire is designed to analyze the results of the travel choice under different decision-making scenarios. Model parameters are estimated using nonlinear regression, and the utility calculation principles are developed under different hypothetical scenarios. Then, new expressions for the utility function under deterministic and risky conditions are presented. For verification, the nonlinear correlation coefficient and hit rate are used to compare the proposed MA-TC model with the other two models: (1) the classical prospect theory with travel time and cost (PT-TC model) and (2) mental accounting based on the original hedonic editing criterion (MA-HE model). The results show that model parameters under deterministic and risky conditions are pretty different. In the deterministic case, travelers have similar sensitivity to the change in gain and loss of travel time and cost. The prediction accuracy of the MA-TC model is 3% lower than the PT-TC model and 6% higher than the MA-HE model. Under risky conditions, travelers are more sensitive to the change in loss than to the change in gain. Additionally, travelers tend to overestimate small probabilities and underestimate high probabilities when losing more than when gaining. The prediction accuracy of the MA-TC model is 2% higher than the PT-TC model and 6% higher than the MA-HE model. © 2021 Shixu Liu et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In games of chance, a near miss is said to occur when feedback for a loss approximates a win. For instance, obtaining “cherry–cherry–lemon” on a slot machine could be considered a near miss. Sixty-six years ago, B.F. Skinner first proposed the idea that near-miss events might reinforce continued play in slot machines, and despite some inconsistencies in the experimental literature, belief in this “near-miss effect” has remained strong. In the present manuscript, we will review this literature and present experimental assessments of the near-miss effect on the frequency of the gambling response. Experiment 1 used a tightly controlled resistance-to-extinction procedure in pigeons to evaluate the putative reinforcing effect of near misses relative to a control “far-miss” reel pattern. Experiment 2 extended Experiment 1’s procedure to human participants. The results of both experiments failed to support the near-miss effect hypothesis. Experiment 3 used a further simplified procedure to assess the validity of the resistance-to-extinction paradigm when a probable conditional reinforcer was present on the reel stimuli. Although a clear conditional response was obtained from the reel, subsequent testing in extinction revealed no conditionally reinforcing function of this stimulus on operant response frequency. © 2019, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: While traditional mechanism design typically assumes isomorphism between the type space of the players and their action space, behavioral, technical or regulatory factors can severely restrict the set of actions that are actually available to players. We study single-parameter mechanism-design problems in environments with restricted action spaces. In our first main result, we provide sufficient conditions under which the information-theoretically optimal solution can be implemented in equilibrium. Our second main result shows that for a wide family of social-choice rules the optimal mechanisms with k actions incur an expected loss of O(1k2) compared to the optimal mechanisms with unrestricted action space. We also fully characterize the optimal mechanisms in some simple environments and, finally, we apply our general results to signaling games, public-good models and project planning. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Floods have recently caused significant economic losses and affected a number of civil engineering structures in many countries including the Czech Republic. Various protective measures have been considered to reduce adverse consequences of flooding in future. Decisions concerning expensive measures should be preferably based on risk optimisation, taking into account cost of measures, potential societal and economic consequences and losses of cultural and heritage values in case of historic structures. Methods of probabilistic risk optimisation seem to provide a suitable tool for identification of the most effective permanent and temporary measures. Present paper provides general framework of the risk assessment of heritage structures endangered by fluvial floods. The total consequences may be assessed using Bayesian networks supplemented by decision and utility nodes. Further investigations of relevant input data including societal and economic consequences and losses of cultural and heritage values are desired. © 2010 WIT Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: We have examined the relationship between intentional and unintentional weight loss and the reasons underlying intention to lose weight and all-cause mortality and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-CVD causes in older men. Methods: Prospective study of 4869 men aged 56 to 75 years drawn from general practices in 24 British towns, who in 1996 completed questionnaires about intentional and unintentional weight loss over the preceding 4 years and were followed up for a subsequent 7 years. Results: Unintentional but not intentional weight loss was associated with a significant increase in risk of all-cause mortality compared with men who reported no weight change, even after adjustment for lifestyle characteristics and preexisting disease (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-2.19; and RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.91-1.10, respectively). Men who lost weight intentionally as a result of personal choice showed significant benefit in all-cause mortality (RR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.34-1.00; P = .05), which was largely owing to a significant reduction in mortality from non-CVD causes (RR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.87). The benefit in these men was most apparent in markedly overweight men (BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters] ≥28) and in younger men (age <65 years). Men who lost weight intentionally owing to ill health or physician's advice showed an increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.96-1.94). No harm or benefit was seen for CVD mortality, irrespective of reasons for intentional weight loss. Conclusion: Intentional weight loss carried out for personal reasons is associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality in markedly overweight men, and the data suggest that the earlier the intervention, the greater the chance of benefit.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to analyse the impacts of storage losses and market development on the maize-selling behaviours of rural households in China. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the survey data of 543 households from nine major maize production provinces in China, the authors introduce storage losses to a household's maize-selling decision-making model and use fractional logit model and ordered probit model to empirically analyse the impact of maize storage losses and market development on household maize-selling decisions in China. To overcome potential endogeneity problems, the authors select the weather at drying (whether bad weather occurs during the drying process) and harvest loss as instrumental variables and re-estimate the model. Findings: The results show that increased storage losses prompt farmers to increase the proportion of maize sold within three months after harvest and sell maize in advance. Meanwhile, the degree of market development has a significant impact on farmers' maize-selling decisions. Other factors, such as the maize output, non-agricultural employment and awareness of loss control, also affect farmers' maize-selling behaviours. Research limitations/implications: The government should promote advanced storage facilities, reduce household storage losses, decrease the phenomenon of centralised sales after harvest and help farmers freely choose the suitable time for sales. The government also needs to strengthen market information releases and publicity, reduce transaction costs and help farmers make reasonable sales decisions. Originality/value: The authors introduce storage losses as a separate variable in a farmer's grain-selling decision model to empirically analyse the impact of storage losses on farmers' grain-selling behaviours. Moreover, the authors analyse the impact of market development on household grain-selling behaviours in China. These findings can help avoid oversupply in the market during the harvest season and alleviate the pressure on the market from the supply and demand imbalance. These results are also beneficial for farmers waiting for a higher price and increasing their income. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study aims to provide an optimization model for operational efficiency in individual firms with cap-and-trade carbon emissions regulation. In addition, this study assumes that customers' demand takes a probability distribution. Under this circumstance, our intention is to draw theoretical and policy implications for carbon emissions regulation by setting and analyzing newsvendor models in which the decision maker is loss-averse for her risk preference. Then, we formulate two loss-averse newsvendor models where we use a \"kinked\" piecewise linear and concave utility function. More specifically, we show that our objective functions are concave to derive the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. After then, through a comparative static analysis, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of how the model parameters affect the optimal solution. Then, the analytical results can be summarized as follows. First, in a lost-sale model, loss aversion significantly affects the optimal policy of newsvendors' decision-making with cap-and-trade regulations. Second, in a stockout penalty cost model, the inclusion of cap-and-trade regulation terms and shortage penalty costs adds more structural complexity in the optimal solution. Thus, the directions of the impacts are mixed and the impacts on the optimal solutions are not monotone, especially with cap-and-trade terms. All these analytical results show big differences between the existing risk-neutral and our loss-averse models, which are confirmed by numerical experiments. © 2018 by the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To estimate the expenditure incurred towards treatment of an episode of respiratory infection among under-fives in outpatient and inpatient departments of primary and secondary level health facilities. Methods: During March 2011 – September 2012, under-five children presenting with febrile acute respiratory infection (FARI) in the outpatient (OPD) and inpatient (IPD) departments of public and private health facilities of Ballabgarh, Haryana were enrolled in the study. Children who were free from co-morbidities and whose contact number or proper address were available, were enrolled and followed up over telephone or by house visits till recovery. Information was collected on expenditure incurred towards treatment of FARI. Work loss of each day was valued as per capita national income per day. Cost of service in public facilities were supplemented by WHO-CHOICE estimates. The cost of respiratory episode in different settings are expressed in median and inter quartile range (IQR). Results: One hundred fourteen children from OPD and 75 from IPD were enrolled and followed up till recovery. Among eligible children 40% and 20% in OPD and IPD were excluded respectively as they could not provide address or contact number. The median costs of an episode treated in OPD and IPD were INR 447(IQR: INR 294–669) and INR 7506.06 (IQR: INR 3765–10,406) respectively. Conclusions: Respiratory infections are responsible for substantial economic burden, especially with huge proportion of out-of-pocket expenditure. Total cost of a respiratory episode that required hospitalization was 1.5 times the per capita monthly income of an Indian. © 2017, Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: The purpose of this study was to determine the rate of spontaneous gestational sac loss during the first trimester in women achieving multiple pregnancies by ICSI. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed of 1448 consecutive multiple pregnancies conceived by ICSI. Results: Of the cohort of 1448 pregnancies, twin gestations constituted 59.6% (864), triplets 30.2% (438) and quadruplets 10.0% (146). During the first trimester, 69 (4.7%) patients miscarried, while 179 (12.3%) continued their pregnancies and had fewer gestational sacs at the end of the first trimester than at the beginning. The overall loss rate of any gestational sac during the first trimester in these multiple pregnancies was 10.1%. There was a significant difference in the frequency of spontaneous reduction to twin or singleton pregnancies in the first trimester between women carrying triplets (11.7%) and those carrying quadruplets (3.5%) [P = 0.004; odds ratio (OR) 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-9.1]. The frequency of gestational sac loss was significantly greater among women >35 years old (20.9%) than in women less than 35 years old (15.9%) (P = 0.03; OR 1.4; 95% CI 1.0-1.9).

      "Abstract: Purpose: Pain has psychological, social, physical and spiritual dimensions and therefore this experience is influenced by culture. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and beliefs of Arab Muslim patients with low back pain (LBP) in Bahrain. Methods: We recruited Arab Muslim patients attending physiotherapy with LBP ≥3 months, and ≥18 years of age. Socio-demographic information and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score for pain intensity were collected. Focus groups were conducted between 2013–2014, using pre-determined semi-structured interview questions. Qualitative content analysis was applied with single counting and inclusion of negative instances. Results: 18 participants attended three focus groups (14 females and 4 males) with a mean VAS(SD) = 5.28(±1.97). Five themes were identified; (1) loss of independence, (2)change in identity causes distress, (3) beliefs and attitudes towards low back pain, (4)trying to cope with LBP, and (5)experiences within the healthcare system. Conclusions: Religious and cultural beliefs influenced pain-related beliefs, fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing. We recommend addressing cultural gender roles and using “active” forms of religious coping to inform treatment. Participants’ experiences within and experiences of the healthcare system were similar to Western cultures. This encourages the application of Western findings into practice to facilitate the management of these patients.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION A qualitative exploration was undertaken to explore the experiences of Muslim and/or Arab patients with LBP. Our findings show that females have prioritised family needs over their own, primarily due to perceived gender roles. Contrary to previous findings labelling religious coping as a passive strategy, our findings suggest that religious coping strategies can be both positive and active strategies; such as participation in religious occasions and frequenting mosques. We support recommendations from Western literature to manage LBP; such as prioritising patient education and joint decision-making. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

Methods: We identified all independently living patients who underwent prospective frailty assessment followed by an elective vascular surgery procedure captured in the Vascular Quality Initiative registry (endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm [AAA] repair, thoracic endovascular aortic repair, suprainguinal and infrainguinal bypass, peripheral vascular intervention, carotid endarterectomy, and open AAA) at an academic institution between January 2016 and July 2018. Patient- and procedure-level data were obtained from our institutional data warehouse and Vascular Quality Initiative database, and used to calculate Vascular-Physiological and Operative Severity Score for enumeration of Mortality and Morbidity scores. The association between frailty and composite outcome of any major complications (surgical site infection; graft thrombectomy; major amputation; adverse cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic event; acute renal insufficiency; and/or reoperation related to the index procedure), nonhome living status, or death within 1 year after low-, medium-, and high-stress vascular procedures was evaluated using bivariate and logistic regression models. Results: A total of 163 patients were identified (70% male, mean age 67.8 years) who underwent open AAA repair (6%), endovascular AAA repair (21%), thoracic endovascular aortic repair (7%), suprainguinal bypass (5%), infrainguinal bypass (18%), carotid endarterectomy (18%), or peripheral vascular interventions (25%), which included 44 (27%) patients diagnosed with frailty before surgery. Overall, frail patients had significantly higher rates of the 1-year composite outcome (48% frail versus 27% nonfrail; P = 0.012) when compared with nonfrail patients, with a significant dose-dependent effect as the level of stress increased. In comparison, increasing levels of surgical stress had a negligible effect on long-term outcomes among nonfrail patients. The interaction between frailty and high surgical stress was found in adjusted regression models to be a significant predictor of adverse outcomes within 1 year after vascular surgery (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.3–8.6; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Frail patients who undergo high-stress vascular procedures have a significantly higher rate of complications leading to loss of functional independence and mortality within the year after their surgery. These data suggest that estimates of surgical stress should be incorporated into clinical decision making for frail older patients before and after surgery. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper analyses the employment and migration expectations and the perceived costs and returns to migration of a group of workers who have recently lost their employment due to the closure of the major employer in a small rural community. A model of migration decision-making is developed and data relating to this are presented. The contingent valuation approach is used to estimate the losses associated with a move away from the area. The results of an attempt to estimate the complete migration model are described. Finally, the likely approach to the issue of migration under these particular circumtances is discussed. © 1985.\u001b[0m :\n",

The optimal decision strategy is easy to describe and the probability of success is known. In this paper, we analyze properties of the optimal Markov time related to the variants of the classical secretary problem. Modifications to the problem take into account the behavior that adopts a loss suffered by the recruiter in the absence of a final indication of the candidate or when the chosen candidate is not appropriate. There is no guarantee that the optimal strategy for these problems is unique.

      "Abstract: Financial fraud is a societal problem for adults of all ages, but financial losses are especially damaging to older adults who typically live on fixed incomes and have less time to recoup losses. Persuasion tactics used by fraud perpetrators often elicit high levels of emotional arousal; thus, studying emotional arousal may help to identify the conditions under which individuals are particularly susceptible to fraud. We examined whether inducing high-arousal positive (HAP) and high-arousal negative (HAN) emotions increased susceptibility to fraud. Older (ages 65 to 85) and younger (ages 30 to 40) adults were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 emotional arousal conditions in a laboratory task: HAP, HAN, or low arousal (LA). Fraud susceptibility was assessed through participants' responses to misleading advertisements. Both HAP and HAN emotions were successfully induced in older and younger participants. For participants who exhibited the intended induced emotional arousal, both the HAP and HAN conditions, relative to the LA condition, significantly increased participants' reported intention to purchase falsely advertised items. These effects did not differ significantly between older and younger adults and were mitigated in participants who did not exhibit the intended emotional arousal. However, irrespective of the emotional arousal condition to which older adults were assigned (HAP, HAN, or LA), they reported greater purchase intention than did younger adults. These results inform the literature on fraud susceptibility and aging. Educating consumers to postpone financial decisions until they are in calm emotional states may protect against this common persuasion tactic. © 2018 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Farmers’ subjective perceptions of climatic changes are not always in line with historic climate observations. Adaptation decisions based on these perceptions thus remain controversial. The paper therefore relates to the following questions: First, what are farmers’ perceptions of climatic changes? Second, do they correlate with observations from climatic data? Third, how do farmers respond and what are the factors determining adaptation? The analysis is based on household survey data from a sample of 900 farmers in rural Tanzania and secondary data from local meteorological stations. We find that farmers’ perception of a rising average temperature over time is generally confirmed. This is not the case for rainfall: farmers perceive that annual rainfall amount decreased, while climate data rather shows no change in the amount, but indicates a change in the rainfall pattern. However, we do find only a weak link between farmers’ perception and their behavior. Although farmers perceive climatic changes to happen and to affect them, some choose to not adapt at all and many only react in an evasive way, i.e., by coping measures that will not protect their household from future damage. Only a small share of farmers chose investment-intensive long-term strategies such as irrigation systems. Results confirm that a limited adaptive capacity plays a role, but also reveal the intention to adapt as a relevant factor. This is represented by the farmers’ loss experience due to climatic shocks and personality traits. This approach gives a more complete picture of the farmers’ adaptation decision. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: In professional sports, injuries resulting in loss of playing time have serious implications for both the athlete and the organization. Efforts to quantify injury probability utilizing machine learning have been met with renewed interest, and the development of effective models has the potential to supplement the decision-making process of team physicians. Purpose/Hypothesis: The purpose of this study was to (1) characterize the epidemiology of time-loss lower extremity muscle strains (LEMSs) in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1999 to 2019 and (2) determine the validity of a machine-learning model in predicting injury risk. It was hypothesized that time-loss LEMSs would be infrequent in this cohort and that a machine-learning model would outperform conventional methods in the prediction of injury risk. Study Design: Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Performance data and rates of the 4 major muscle strain injury types (hamstring, quadriceps, calf, and groin) were compiled from the 1999 to 2019 NBA seasons. Injuries included all publicly reported injuries that resulted in lost playing time. Models to predict the occurrence of a LEMS were generated using random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), neural network, support vector machines, elastic net penalized logistic regression, and generalized logistic regression. Performance was compared utilizing discrimination, calibration, decision curve analysis, and the Brier score. Results: A total of 736 LEMSs resulting in lost playing time occurred among 2103 athletes. Important variables for predicting LEMS included previous number of lower extremity injuries; age; recent history of injuries to the ankle, hamstring, or groin; and recent history of concussion as well as 3-point attempt rate and free throw attempt rate. The XGBoost machine achieved the best performance based on discrimination assessed via internal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.840), calibration, and decision curve analysis. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost outperformed logistic regression in the prediction of a LEMS that will result in lost time. Several variables increased the risk of LEMS, including a history of various lower extremity injuries, recent concussion, and total number of previous injuries. © The Author(s) 2022.\u001b[0m :\n",

The subject heard noise alone (white noise) or a signal superimposed on the noise (1000-Hz tone) and had to report what he heard in each trial. Risk situations were manipulated by changing the monetary reward and penalty associated with correct and incorrect responses. Eight male volunteers participated in this study. It was found that under anaesthetic influence they did not avoid the same risks which had been avoided under control conditions. The findings are explained in terms of influence of the gas on loss of control and lessened responsibility for the result of behaviour. © 1978 Macmillan Journals Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In making societal decisions concerning hazards with potentially disastrous consequences, it is important to have sound knowledge of how people evaluate the seriousness of disasters. In this study, a group of students evaluated the seriousness of disasters in terms of four basic attributes (and their ranges): number of fatalities (0-1000), number of serious injuries (0-4000), economic loss (SEK 0-40 billion) and cause of the disaster (natural, accidental, terrorism). Attribute weights were elicited by two separate methods, which taken together provide insight into the uncertainty of the elicited weights. Most participants regarded the attributes related to physical harm (especially the number of fatalities) as most serious, a finding that must be seen in relation to the ranges of the attributes. In addition, the cause of a disaster also affected many of the participants' judgements of its seriousness. This paper's findings are of value to societal decision making, particularly in the case of small to medium-sized projects in which specific elicitations of stakeholders' values are rarely made.

      "Abstract: Climate change is increasingly challenging the ability of millions of people to sustain livelihoods as the places where they live become uninhabitable. The relocation of populations as individuals, households, and communities within countries and across international borders demonstrates the complexity of climate change impacts. Looking at the literature, some researchers argue that relocation caused by climate change can be an effective strategy to adapt to localized changes, whereas others argue that the movement away from ones' homeland is more neatly captured in the climate change lexicon as ‘loss and damage’. We argue here that the relocation of people as a result of the impacts of climate change can be both adaptation and loss and damage. Drawing on examples from Alaska and Kiribati, we show that dividing this issue between the two concepts is unhelpful in resolving key issues around the types of appropriate support for these transitions to sustain and protect livelihoods and to open up possibilities for self-determined futures. Policy Relevance Climate-induced relocation poses a significant challenge for the populations affected as well as the government agencies tasked with providing technical assistance and funding. At present, policies and institutional frameworks have not yet been developed to accommodate these challenges, despite the urgent need to do so. When the relocation of populations can be planned, participatory, and people centred, then it can be an adaptation strategy that will protect people from the permanent loss of land and livelihoods. If these movements are decided, driven, managed, and undertaken by those affected, then there is the potential for the relocation to also be a transformative opportunity for people to respond to the impacts of climate change, and sustain their livelihoods and possibly even improve certain livelihood outcomes. However, these relocations also cause significant loss and damage. The extent of the loss and damage will partly depend on the ability to have these relocations planned and ensure that human rights protections are embedded in institutional frameworks. The article shares a series of lessons and learnings that are of policy relevance at a variety of scales. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Efficient implicit emotion regulation processes, which run without awareness, are important for human well-being. In this study, to investigate the influence of implicit emotion regulation on psychological and electrophysiological responses to gains and losses, participants were required to select between two Chinese four-character idioms to match the meaning of the third one before they performed a monetary gambling task. According to whether their meanings were related to emotion regulation, the idioms fell into two categories. Event-related potentials and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Priming emotion regulation reduced subjective emotional experience to both gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity, while the P3 component was not influenced. According to these results, we suggest that the application of implicit emotion regulation effectively modulated the subjective emotional experience and the motivational salience of current outcomes without the cost of cognitive resources. This study implicates the potential significance of implicit emotion regulation in decision-making processes. © The Author (2014).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: During the past decade, the number of earthquakes has increased dramatically in the state of Oklahoma, largely attributed to induced seismicity from wastewater injections (hydraulic fracturing). The increased seismic disaster risk in Oklahoma has captured public attention and necessitated actions by decision makers to mediate the consequences. Geospatial modeling to identify the populations exposed to higher levels of potential risk can help prioritize locations for mitigation actions based on the underlying social vulnerability of residents. In this paper, we explore a method for integrating the spatial distribution of seismic risk (hazard exposure) with social vulnerability (hazard impact). Loss scenarios, social vulnerability metrics, and potential physical damage are combined in a geographic information system to identify the spatial vulnerability of an exposed population to the increased seismic risk, and the locations for targeting mitigation actions — areas with the greatest exposure and vulnerability. The results of induced seismicity earthquake scenarios show disproportionately higher losses for places with more minority populations (primarily African-American) and more renters when compared to the non-induced scenarios, suggesting a potential environmental justice concern. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper examines the Obama administration’s arguments for ratifying the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to limit Iran’s nuclear capabilities and whether these claims encouraged U.S. senators to approve the agreement. The analysis relies on Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) prospect theory in which more risk is taken to avoid certain loss and improve conditions when options are framed in terms of losses rather than gains. We argue that the Obama administration was able to persuade Democratic senators to support the JCPOA by arguing the agreement had the potential to curb the development of nuclear weapons by the Iranian regime. But more importantly, the administration was able to frame the status quo as a certain loss, and thus, the risk associated with the JCPOA was acceptable in comparison to not adopting the agreement. Our analysis of the Obama administration’s lobbying efforts and the Democratic senators' statements in support of the agreement demonstrate the value of applying prospect theory to understanding decision making with respect to American foreign policy formulation. © 2019, © 2019 American University, Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aims and objectives: The purpose of this research was to critically examine the factors that contribute to turnover of experienced nurses' including their decision to leave practice settings and seek alternate nursing employment. In this study, we explore experienced nurses' decision-making processes and examine the personal and environmental factors that influenced their decision to leave. Background: Nursing turnover remains a pressing problem for healthcare delivery. Turnover contributes to increased recruitment and orientation cost, reduced quality patient care and the loss of mentorship for new nurses. Design: A qualitative, interpretive descriptive approach was used to guide the study. Methods: Interviews were conducted with 12 registered nurses, averaging 16 years in practice. Participants were equally represented from an array of acute care inpatient settings. The sample drew on perspectives from point-of-care nurses and nurses in leadership roles, primarily charge nurses and clinical nurse educators. Results: Nurses' decisions to leave practice were influenced by several interrelated work environment and personal factors: higher patient acuity, increased workload demands, ineffective working relationships among nurses and with physicians, gaps in leadership support and negative impacts on nurses' health and well-being. Ineffective working relationships with other nurses and lack of leadership support led nurses to feel dissatisfied and ill equipped to perform their job. The impact of high stress was evident on the health and emotional well-being of nurses. Conclusions: It is vital that healthcare organisations learn to minimise turnover and retain the wealth of experienced nurses in acute care settings to maintain quality patient care and contain costs. Relevance to clinical practice: This study highlights the need for healthcare leaders to re-examine how they promote collaborative practice, enhance supportive leadership behaviours, and reduce nurses' workplace stressors to retain the skills and knowledge of experienced nurses at the point-of-care. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Based on the multi-layer network perspective, a method for constructing the double-layer urban rail transit topology network was proposed. Then, the choice behavior of passengers at congested stations was analyzed, and the passenger flow loss rate was quantified. Moreover, a congestion propagation model for the double-layer urban rail transit network was proposed, and the congestion propagation process was analyzed using a real network as an illustration. The results indicate that once the congestion disturbance reaches an influence threshold, the congestion would propagate to other stations in the same or different layers, ultimately spreading widely in the network. The preferences and risk attitudes of passengers at congested stations affect the passenger flow loss rate. Furthermore, the spontaneous travel choice behavior of passengers at congested stations can regulate the congestion propagation process of urban rail transit networks. The stations with high topological importance are more capable of propagating congestion than stations with high functional importance, and the passenger flow distribution structure of the network is more fragile than the network topological structure. The increase in coupling coefficient leads to a rise in station-to-station interaction, making congestion more likely to propagate. The research results can provide a reference for urban rail transit passenger flow operation organization. © (2023), (International Association of Engineers). All Rights Reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

To understand how students attending community colleges make field-of-study decisions, I link administrative educational records of recent high school graduates with local mass layoff and plant-closing announcements. I find that declines in local employment deter students from entering closely related community college programs and instead induce them to enrol in other vocationally oriented programs.

      "Abstract: Human behavior is more strongly driven by the motivation to avoid losses than to pursue gains (loss aversion). However, there is little research on how losses influence the motivation to exert effort. We compared the effects of loss and gain incentives on cognitive task performance and effort-based decision making. In three experiments, participants performed a cognitively effortful task under gain and loss conditions and made choices about effort expenditure in a decision-making task. Results consistently showed significant loss aversion in effort-based decision making. Participants were willing to invest more effort in the loss compared to the gain condition (i.e., perform a longer duration task: Experiments 1 and 2; or higher task load: Experiment 3). On the other hand, losses did not lead to improved performance (sustained attention), or higher physiological effort (pupil diameter) in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, losses did enhance working memory performance, but only at the highest load level. Taken together, these results suggest that loss aversion motivates higher effort investment in effort-based decision-making, while the effect of loss aversion during a performance may depend on the task type or effort level. © Copyright © 2020 Massar, Pu, Chen and Chee.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of this study is to provide additional evidence regarding the effect of ambiguity on auditors’ and investors’ judgments when they evaluate managers’ disclosures about loss contingencies. Inspired by Nelson and Kinney (1997), we conducted an experiment where auditors and investors evaluate management’s loss disclosures. We manipulate the probability of loss at three levels and the uncertainty about the ambiguity at two levels. Our results show that both auditors and investors appear to be aggressive toward financial reporting choices, and are less willing to recommend a loss contingency disclosure when there is ambiguity. Our results extend prior accounting literature and highlight the importance of understanding imprecise estimates in financial reporting. We found that auditors and investors reacted very similarly toward ambiguity in loss disclosures. This result may reflect a narrowing of the expectations gap around reporting accounting estimates and highlight the potential improvements in users’ confidence in accountants. © 2020, American Accounting Association.

      "Abstract: With considerable focus on ecotourism's potential to contribute to conservation, it is increasingly important to understand the implications of ecological information in triggering sustainability-relevant attitudes and actions. This study assesses whether people who have ecological information regarding the negative impact of their recreational behavior on penguins' stress will choose to remain farther away from the penguins to avoid that impact although this option will reduce the personal benefits of their tourism experience. To answer this question, we use a choice experiment with three attributes related to \"Humboldt penguin watching\": (1) price of the experience, (2) distance at which penguins could be observed, and (3) penguin density. In addition, we used two treatments: with and without ecological information. We used a pooled data (with and without information) mixed logit model to identify the effect of providing or not providing information. Using a chi-square test, we first tested whether people in the sample with information chose different alternatives than those individuals without information. Furthermore, we evaluate whether the coefficient associated with the attributes of the mixed logit model, and therefore people's behavioral preferences, differs among samples. Results show that, irrespective of socio-demographic differences, visitors with information were more prone to select alternatives that reduce penguin stress, despite more educated, wealthier, and older people tend to increase their welfare when they choose being closer to the penguins. People without information never choose the alternative which results in a reduction of penguin stress. Ecological information is shown to reverse this trend, in fact, tourists perceived (on average) a welfare loss of CL$1099 (US$1.9) if he/she is too close to the penguins once information has been granted. These results are encouraging because they support the claim that well-defined educational and informational campaigns can have important effects on the way in which people behave in areas of interest for conservation. Granting ecological information can become an important tool to encourage conservation behavior, particularly in areas where support for enforcement is weak. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The aim of this study was to analyze how critical factors at different levels in a health-care system interact and impact nurses’ intention to leave and decision to quit their job at a hospital unit. Methods: A case study of assistant and registered nurses’ intentions to leave as well as staff turnover at a smaller Swedish public hospital was performed. Employee surveys and interviews with assistant and registered nurses who had quit their job at four units in the hospital during the period 2012–2019 were performed. Critical factors regarding nurses’ intention to leave and staff turnover are analyzed by combining narrative methods with a critical incidence technique. Results: Three main themes emerge from the analysis of factors contributing to the decision to quit, namely lack or loss of buffering factors, not owning your spare time and not feeling valued by and listened to by upper management. Conclusion: Decision-makers, including hospital management, need to consider how supportive factors in nurses’ closest work environment that promote staff retention may be impacted by decisions at higher levels, such as health-care reorganizations and stricter governance. In this context, upper management adopting a servant leadership approach might contribute to employees to a greater extent feeling valued and being listened to. Finally, the results indicate that individual nurses’ recovery, ability to work and ability to coordinate their personal life with their work life need to be supported by policies and decisions at higher levels in order to retain nurses in intensive and emergency health-care settings. © 2022 Eriksson et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigates the influence of subjective interpretations of strategy-relevant cues, specifically, perceived control/uncontrol and perceived gain/loss, on the relationship between causation or effectuation approach and the likelihood of initial venture sales. The results support the greater likelihood of initial sales when the entrepreneur increasingly relies on causation (albeit at low to medium levels) and has a greater perception of control. Similarly, perceived gains (instead of losses) strengthen the positive relationship between effectuation and initial sales. These results extend previous research on influence of the perceptions of control/uncontrol and gain/loss by supporting the influence of such subjective interpretations for strategic decision making. Furthermore, this study responds to recent calls for research on the different interpretations of the same environmental conditions and the resulting consequences for entrepreneurs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decision-making strategies shift during normal aging and can profoundly affect wellbeing. Although overweighing losses compared to gains, termed “loss aversion,” plays an important role in choice selection, the age trajectory of this effect and how it may be influenced by associated changes in brain structure remain unclear. We therefore investigated the relationship between age and loss aversion, and tested for its mediation by cortical thinning in brain regions that are susceptible to age-related declines and are implicated in loss aversion — the insular, orbitofrontal, and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. Healthy participants (n = 106, 17–54 years) performed the Loss Aversion Task. A subgroup (n = 78) provided structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Loss aversion followed a curvilinear trajectory, declining in young adulthood and increasing in middle-age, and thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex mediated this trajectory. The findings suggest that beyond a threshold in middle adulthood, atrophy of the posterior cingulate cortex influences loss aversion. © Copyright © 2021 Guttman, Ghahremani, Pochon, Dean and London.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Hedging offsets the risk of an existing stake by counterbalancing it with a new stake - for example, complementing a bet on the race favorite with another bet on a promising upstart. In three experiments, the authors find that rather than assessing the hedge as a whole, people tend to react to the hedging outcome by focusing on either the original stake or the new one. The authors show that the hedger's focus is linked to a psychological motivation of whether to pursue safety and security by minimizing losses, known as a \"prevention orientation,\" or to pursue growth and advancement by maximizing gains, known as a \"promotion orientation.\" When the context is gambling, prevention-oriented people fixate on what happens to the status quo stake, whereas promotion-oriented people attend to the new stake (Experiment 1). The same conclusion emerges from a stock-investing context (Experiments 2a and 2b). Moreover, because selective attention to status quo and change is the mechanism at work, the authors find that a choice between options characterized as maintaining the status quo elicits greater discrimination among prevention-oriented than promotion-oriented people; similarly, a choice between options characterized as initiating change elicits greater discrimination among promotion-oriented than prevention-oriented people (Experiment 3). These effects drive behavioral intentions. © 2007, American Marketing Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Highly modified coasts are associated to sub-optimal provision of ecosystem services, causing biodiversity losses and negative impacts on social welfare. Although ecological arguments can justify the restoration of coastal environments, technical, social and economic issues often pose complex obstacles to implement efficient restorations. Indeed, there is a lack of socioeconomic assessments in both academic literature and policy decision-making showing whether the restoration of highly modified coasts are socially acceptable and economically efficient. This paper presents the case of the Portmán Bay (SE Spain), described as the most polluted coastal area by mining activities in the entire Mediterranean region. The question on how to restore the bay has been under debate for decades and there is not social and political consensus about its restoration yet. Our results suggest that, in terms of social preferences and net benefits, the preferred alternative would be to recover the coast and improve habitat continuity between the bay and other adjacent natural areas. Development of other economic activities incompatible with natural conservation could only compensate social welfare losses by increasing public taxation on private sector. Our results confirm that, once social preferences are taken into account, the restoration of heavily modified coastal ecosystems can be economically efficient even though it implies significant technical constraints and high public expenditures. © 2023 The Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: • Contemporary medicine has much to its credit, but has created an insatiable demand for new technologies and more health services, fed by commercial promotion, professional advocacy and sociopolitical pressure. • Total health expenditure at the national level is now almost 10% of gross domestic product and is expected to top 16% by 2020. • After recent inquiries into the failings of its public health system, the Queensland Government has committed itself to a 25% increase in expenditure on health over the next 5 years. But will it lead to better population health, and is it sustainable? • The return-on-investment curve for modern health care may be flattening out, in an environment of growing numbers of older patients with chronic illnesses, maldistribution of services and hospital overcrowding. • A change in thinking is required if current medical practice is to avoid imploding when confronted with the next major economic downturn. • Health policy, service funding and clinical training must focus on critical appraisal of the effectiveness of health care technologies and the structure and financing of health care systems. • Practising clinicians will be obliged to provide leadership in determining value for money in the choice of health care for specific patient populations and how that care is delivered.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) provide advice to physicians that could save patients’ lives, but they could also make physicians feel losing face. Considering the pivotal role of face in social interactions in China, this research attempts to understand Chinese physicians’ dilemma of choosing between saving face or saving patients and how this dilemma makes them reluctant to follow CDSS recommendations. Drawing from the dual process theory, we postulate that physicians’ resistance to CDSS recommendations is reduced by their rational perception of the system’s usefulness and increased by their experiential belief of face loss and that these effects are contingent on two contextual factors, professional autonomy, and time pressure. Based on a longitudinal field survey with 182 physicians and follow-up interviews in a large Chinese hospital, we find support for the opposing effects of face loss and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, we show that face loss has a stronger effect on CDSS resistance at a high level of professional autonomy. In addition, when time pressure is high, perceived usefulness more strongly reduces while face loss more strongly increases CDSS resistance, thus amplifying the dilemma. This research makes a significant contribution by integrating the concept of face loss into information technology resistance research and revealing the dark side of professional autonomy and the paradoxical moderating effect of time pressure in the healthcare context. © 2021 INFORMS\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The amount of electronic waste, such as used mobile phones and computers, has been experiencing a sharp increase due to factors, including continuous product updates, short product life cycles and a large number of users. Determining ways to recycle and dispose of electronic waste effectively has become an important issue requiring worldwide attention. The rapid development of information and internet technology has brought new techniques to recycle electronic waste in recent years. Because of the advantages of being light in weight and easy to carry, electronic waste, such as used mobile phones and computers, can be recycled conveniently for customers through the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform. Therefore, the ‘Internet +’ platform is regarded as an effective way to increase the recycling rate of electronic waste. However, during the process of ‘Internet +’ recycling, the final recycling prices of used products are usually uncertain for customers. They worry that the recycling platform might use the lack of information transparency during the quality inspection process to deliberately decrease the recycling prices and then buy low and sell high to make a profit. In addition, the large deviation between final recycling prices and the platform′s estimated prices may be unacceptable for customers, resulting in a low recycling rate of electronic waste by the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform that is far below the desired level. Further, consumers with irrational behaviours may regard these estimated prices as references for recycling prices of used products. When the final recycling price of a used product is lower than its estimated price, a consumer might exhibit loss aversion characteristics. This study investigates the optimal pricing decision of the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform. Based on the uncertainty of the recycling price on the online recycling platform, this work considers the impact of consumer loss aversion characteristics on pricing decisions. By assuming the scenarios of consumers with or without loss aversion characteristics, three pricing models are constructed under the situations where the rating of used products′ pricing with mismatched quality is based on the following factors: their real quality level, incomplete information and complete information. Furthermore, a comparison analysis of the constructed models in terms of the optimal pricing strategy and the profit of the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform is conducted. From the study, some meaningful results are as follows: first, when the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform re-prices used products with mismatched quality ratings, the following two pricing strategies can be adopted. If the differences among the residuals of used products with varying quality grades are not large, then used products with mismatched quality ratings should not be re-priced to avoid possible monetary losses. Conversely, re-pricing of used products with mismatched quality ratings should be done when the differences among the residuals of used products with varying quality grades are large. Second, considering the time-sensitivity of the used products price and loss in value of used products because of the disassembly operation of the recycling platform, this study suggested that the value loss factor of returning used products increases and the number of consumers returning used products decreases, increasing the profit of the recycling platform thereby. However, these models do not imply that the recycling platform can increase the recycling platform′s revenue by increasing the value loss of used products because the time lapsed from participating in online recycling to returning a used product is quite short. In addition, the loss of value of returning the used products results from the dismantling behaviour of the recycling platform. Because of this, consumers may lose their trust in the recycling platform and will no longer participate in online recycling. Third, regardless of whether consumers have loss aversion characteristics, the recycling platform gains the lowest profit in the model where used products with mismatched quality ratings are directly priced based on their true quality level. Conversely, the recycling platform gains the highest profit under the secondary pricing model, where the proportion of used products with mismatched quality ratings is predictable. Finally, consumer loss aversion characteristics negatively impact the ‘Internet +’ recycling platform. The higher the percentage of consumers holding low-value used products, the percentage of used products with mismatched quality ratings or the level of consumer loss aversion, the greater the positive impact of the complete information pricing decision model and the greater the negative impact of consumer loss aversion on the recycling platform. In practice, the recycling platform can increase its revenue in the following ways: First, it should reasonably set up the website′s price evaluation system. With reasonable strategies, such as reducing the proportion of used products with mismatched quality ratings, avoiding an excessively detailed classification of evaluation options to obscure consumers′ choices or reducing the number of quality grade of used products to widen the gap among different quality levels of used products, the recycling platform may increase its revenue and alleviate the impacts of consumer loss aversion characteristics. Second, in the case of used products with mismatched quality ratings and consumer loss aversion characteristics, the recycling platform should collect historical data and estimate the proportion of used products with mismatched quality ratings. Thus, the recycling platform can increase its revenue and reduce the negative impact of consumer loss aversion characteristics using the pricing decision model under complete information. © 2022,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.

      "Abstract: Objective: Obesity-related problems can now be managed with effective nutritional therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgeries that achieve >10% weight loss. Assessing patient preferences, treatment choices, and factors affecting patients can improve treatment compliance and efficacy. Our aim was to identify factors affecting patient preference and subsequent choice of pharmacotherapy among those seeking treatment for obesity-related disorders. Methods: A participatory action study using purposeful sampling recruited 33 patients with obesity complications. They were referred to specialist clinics in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease. Sixteen males and seventeen females aged 18–70 years, with BMI > 35 kg/m2 were recruited. Before the interview, participants watched a 60-minute video explaining nutritional therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery in equipoise. Data were collected in semi-structured interviews; Reflective thematic analysis was used. This sub study focuses only on patients who expressed specific attitudes (positive or negative) towards pharmacotherapy. Results: Ten (30%) patients expressed a view on pharmacotherapy. Eight (24%) patients chose pharmacotherapy alone, whereas two (6%) patients chose pharmacotherapy combined with nutritional therapy. In this sub study focusing on pharmacotherapy, five themes were identified related to choosing whether or not to take medication: (1) attitudes towards pharmacotherapy, (2) attitudes toward size of obesity and its complications, (3) weighing the benefits and risks of treatment, (4) knowledge and reassurance of health professionals, and (5) costs associated with drug therapy. Conclusion: The primary concerns regarding pharmacotherapy for intentional weight loss were efficacy, side effects, lifelong dosing, pharmacokinetics, and cost. Providing access to information about all the pharmacotherapies and the benefits is likely to result in greater penetrance of treatment. © The Author(s) 2024.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background. Current patient education and informed consent regarding weight loss expectations for bariatric surgery candidates are largely based on averages from large patient cohorts. The variation in weight loss outcomes illustrates the need for establishing more realistic weight loss goals for individual patients. This study was designed to develop a simple web-based tool which provides patient-specific weight loss expectations. Methods. Postoperative weight measurements after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) were collected and analyzed with patient characteristics known to influence weight loss outcomes. Quantile regression was used to create expected weight loss curves (25th, 50th, and 75th %tile) for the 24 months after RYGB. The resulting equations were validated and used to develop web-based tool for predicting weight loss outcomes. Results. Weight loss data from 2986 patients (2608 in the primary cohort and 378 in the validation cohort) were included. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) and age were found to have a high correlation with weight loss accomplishment (P < 0.0001 for each). An electronic tool was created that provides easy access to patient-specific, 24-month weight loss trajectories based on initial BMI and age. Conclusions. This validated, patient-centered electronic tool will assist patients and providers in patient teaching, informed consent, and postoperative weight loss management. © 2014 G.

It can prevent losses with false alarms and, or, excessive inspection. It was a computational simulation study through the application of Duncan's (1956) model for the economic design of control charts. The model was optimized using a simulated annealing algorithm to find the parameters' values-a comparative study realized with a real case and a decision flow chart for SPC implementation provided. The results have several relevant practical implications, since the correct decision concerning the inspection type to be adopted based on the proportion of defective items allows its operation with lower costs, eliminating wastes in unnecessary inspections. The optimization of resources also contributes to focusing efforts on continuous process improvement. © Centar for Quality.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Companies frequently use Internet Financial Reporting (IFR) to distribute financial and nonfinancial information to stakeholders. Research suggests that companies often distribute information via the web for impression management purposes in order to diffuse potential negative reactions and/or to promote positive reactions to corporate policies and actions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether web disclosure of environmental information and the presentation format influences the outcomes of litigation awards. Results indicate that even a partial web disclosure of pending environmental sanctions on a company's financial statement reduces the compensatory and punitive damages that jurors award when shareholders suffer losses as a result of environmental sanctions. The results also indicate that firms using enhanced presentation formats when disclosing environmental information further reduce the amount of damages awarded against them. These results have implications for users and preparers of IFR, and for policy makers weighing mandates for disclosure of nonfinancial information in annual reports.

      "Abstract: Considerable studies have examined and ascertained a significant number of male victims of domestic abuse, yet less is known about the social experiences of men who report their victimization. This study aims to explore the factors that interplay in the decisions of abused men to report, the sociocultural barriers to reporting abuse, and post-report social reactions toward victimized men. Fifty-two male victims of wife-initiated and perpetrated violence were engaged in a qualitative study, and an interpretative phenomenological analysis was carried out. Findings indicated a positive disposition of victims toward reporting but exhibited reluctance in reporting due to fear of social stigmatization, loss of sources of livelihood, and socio-religious statuses. Recognition of the predicaments of abused men in reporting and help-seeking processes is suggested, for their safety, coping, and wellbeing not to be compromised. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Behavioural approaches to weight loss are often initially successful but less so in the longer term, as some people maintain the necessary behaviour changes while others do not. This study aimed to derive possible explanations for this using a qualitative approach with a view to improving intervention effectiveness. Methods: Thirty-six participants in a development and feasibility study for a weight loss and maintenance intervention (called SkiM) were interviewed three times over 18 months regarding their experiences before, during and after the intervention. Data were analysed thematically. The accounts of those who were more and less successful in terms of longer term weight loss were compared, and a conceptual model linking the main analytic themes was developed. Results: Five interpretative themes were generated: encountering and managing key situations; the impact of emotion; the source of control; personal values; and acquiring knowledge and skills. These themes were linked through a model of decision-making during key situations. In this model, behavioural decisions emerge from a dynamic interplay between several drivers: emotional state and needs, perceived control, personal values, the individual's knowledge and skills, and their existing habits. The individual's response in key situations generates experiential learning that can influence decisional dynamics in similar situations in future. These dynamics appeared to differ between participants, and between those who were more and less successful in weight management. Conclusions: Our analysis and model of decision-making during weight-management have implications for the development and delivery of behavioural weight management interventions. By helping individuals to identify the drivers of their decision-making in key situations, and equipping them to manage these drivers, programmes may enhance their capacity to sustain the behaviour changes needed for long-term weight loss. © 2020 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose To elicit preference values for health states associated with Stage III colon cancer (CRC) and to explore the effect of neuropathy associated with current adjuvant treatment. Methods We used time trade-off (TTO) techniques to elicit preferences from 49 CRC patients and 49 community members. We elicited preferences for 7 health states: remission; adjuvant therapy with no, mild, moderate, and severe neuropathy; metastatic stable; and metastatic progressive disease. Mean TTO values were adjusted for the covariates age, education, and current health. Results Patients' adjusted mean TTO value for remission was 0.83; adjuvant chemotherapy health states ranged from 0.48 to 0.61. Significant differences were observed for both patient and community groups between TTO for remission and all adjuvant health states (P\\0.001), and between adjuvant therapy with no neuropathy and metastatic health states (P B 0.001). Across all health states, patients' values were on average 0.12 higher than community members (P\\0.05). Conclusions The findings highlight the trade-offs between the disutility of adjuvant treatment, the higher utility of remission, and the severe utility loss during metastatic disease. The preference values obtained from this study will be useful for informing patients' treatment decisions and payer cost-utility analyses of adjuvant treatment for colon cancer.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this study is to examine the Probabilistic Mental Model (PMM) Theory as an explanation of the framing effect in the context of reporting risk in different formats in Indonesia. The study was conducted using an online field experimental method with 3x4x2 mixed design, involving 54 investment analysts as participants. Experiments were conducted to test whether different formats of risk information-given the time sequence associated with the framing effect as explained by the PMM Theory-influence the investment decision-making process. The results show that participants chose to take action that is not at risk when the information presented is in a positive frame. Gains or a loss of information that accompanies the risk information does not affect participants' decision relating to investments they would do. The investment decisions tend to avoid risk. Decision makers in a positive frame risk conditions do not make decision that reduce the risk of gains they already have. When risk information is presented in a negative frame, the participants chose to make decisions that minimize losses that may arise as the results of an investment decision. Practical implication of this study is that the investor needs to respond to the framing effect because a similar problem with a different frame may result in a different choice. Investors need to be encouraged to improve the knowledge and reduce bias in decision-making caused by the presence of framing in a single set of accounting information. This study has proven to be useful in improving the ability to analyze risk reports by financial analyst. © 2013 De La Salle University, Philippines.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: On Michael Walzer's influential account, 'dirty hands' characterizes the political leader's choice between absolutist moral demands (to abstain from torture) and consequentialist political reasoning (to do what is necessary to prevent the loss of innocent lives). The impulse to torture a 'ticking bomb terrorist' is therefore at least partly pragmatic, straining against morality, while the desire to uphold a ban on torture is purely and properly a moral one. I challenge this 'Machiavellian' view by reinterpreting the dilemma in the framework of the Humean theory of justice and moral sentiment. By interpreting the ticking bomb scenario as a dramatic narrative, I argue that it appeals to properly moral sensibilities, which speak in favour of the use of force against the terrorist. The absolute ban on torture, by contrast, is an 'artificial virtue' and a product of political prudence. On this account, the ticking bomb terrorist dilemma therefore imposes a different burden on the political leader from Walzer's version: an ethic of political responsibility demands that the political leader be prepared to sacrifice her moral soul by upholding the law against moral but politically imprudent demands to break it; while the ticking bomb 'romance' appeals to her feelings of compassionate moral concern towards particular individuals. She dirties her hands morally, not by authorizing torture, but by allowing the terrorist's bomb to detonate and take the lives of the innocent. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risky decision-making seems to be markedly disrupted in patients with chronic pain, probably due to the high cost that impose pain and negative mood on executive control functions. Patients' behavioral performance on decision-making tasks such as the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is characterized by selecting cards more frequently from disadvantageous than from advantageous decks, and by switching often between competing responses in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). In the present study, we developed a simple heuristic model to simulate individuals' choice behavior by varying the level of decision randomness and the importance given to gains and losses. The findings revealed that the model was able to differentiate the behavioral performance of patients with chronic pain and HCs at the group, as well as at the individual level. The best fit of the model in patients with chronic pain was yielded when decisions were not based on previous choices and when gains were considered more relevant than losses. By contrast, the best account of the available data in HCs was obtained when decisions were based on previous experiences and losses loomed larger than gains. In conclusion, our model seems to provide useful information to measure each individual participant extensively, and to deal with the data on a participant-by-participant basis. © 2014 Hess, Haimovici, Muñoz and Montoya.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating chronic illness affecting at least 4 million people in the United States. Understanding its cost improves decisions regarding resource allocation that may be directed towards treatment and cure, and guides the evaluation of clinical and community interventions designed to reduce the burden of disease.Methods: This research estimated direct and indirect costs of CFS and the impact on educational attainment using a population-based, case-control study between September 2004 and July 2005, Georgia, USA. Participants completed a clinical evaluation to confirm CFS, identify other illnesses, and report on socioeconomic factors. We estimated the effect of CFS on direct medical costs (inpatient hospitalizations, provider visits, prescription medication spending, other medical supplies and services) and loss in productivity (employment and earnings) with a stratified sample (n = 500) from metropolitan, urban, and rural Georgia. We adjusted medical costs and earnings for confounders (age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, and geographic strata) using econometric models and weighted estimates to reflect response-rate adjusted sampling rates.Results: Individuals with CFS had mean annual direct medical costs of $5,683. After adjusting for confounding factors, CFS accounted for $3,286 of these costs (p < 0.01), which were driven by increased provider visits and prescription medication use. Nearly one-quarter of these expenses were paid directly out-of pocket by those with CFS. Individuals with CFS reported mean annual household income of $23,076. After adjustment, CFS accounted for $8,554 annually in lost household earnings (p < 0.01). Lower educational attainment accounted for 19% of the reduction in earnings associated with CFS.Conclusions: Study results indicate that chronic fatigue syndrome may lead to substantial increases in healthcare costs and decreases in individual earnings. Studies have estimated up to 2.5% of non-elderly adults may suffer from CFS. In Georgia, a state with roughly 5.5 million people age 18-59, illness could account for $452 million in total healthcare expenditures and $1.2 billion of lost productivity. © 2011 Lin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Defects are driven by quality and a threat to the safety and utility of consumers. In recent years, consumers and supply chain enterprises have obtained increasing attention in product quality safety. However, product safety events caused by quality defects have still occurred frequently. For example, in 2008, Sanlu suffered a total loss of more than 900 million yuan for recalling tainted milk powder and compensating consumers′ loss, making Sanlu go bankrupt. In 2010, Toyota spent nearly 13. 5 billion yuan recalling almost 8 million vehicles due to the suppliers′ accelerator pedals problems. In 2020, GE recalled more than 7 million vehicles worldwide because of the unsafe airbags made by its supplier Takata and undertook a total of 1. 2 billion dollars in recall costs. These product quality safety events reveal that the downstream focal enterprises of the supply chains undertook most of the liability costs by the upstream defective products. Therefore, as the first responsible person, a downstream core enterprise in supply chains has a strong incentive to motivate the upstream manufacturer to improve its quality level of products. However, it can be easily found that the upstream manufacturer, as a follower, usually does not have enough capital to invest in the quality improvement activity. On the other hand, although the quality level can be improved by the upstream manufacturer′s quality investment, leading to an increase in the consumers′ market demand, the manufacturer still gains less from the incremental profit than the downstream core enterprise because of its weak position in the bargaining process between supply chain members. Therefore, this study aims to investigate how to design quality incentive strategies to improve the manufacturer′s quality level in the setting where the quality deficiencies of the manufacturer′ s products cause harm to the consumers and further lead the retailer to bear product liability. So far, most studies of supply chain management have investigated the issue of using coordination contracts to improve the quality level of products and profitability of the entire supply chain. However, studies on the liability cost caused by the upstream manufacturers′ quality defects that damage the consumers and are undertaken by the downstream retailers are still limited. Meanwhile, few studies have compared the effects of different quality incentive strategies and different decision types of the quality incentive strategy in a downstream retailer-dominated supply chain. Based on this, this study establishes a retailer-dominated supply chain game model with an ex-ante quality cost-sharing contract and an ex-post revenue-sharing contract. Both the cost-sharing rate and the revenue-sharing rate can be decided by the retailer alone or by the manufacturer and the retailer through Nash bargaining. First, given the quality incentive contracts exogenously, this study compares the results of the decentralised model and quality incentive models. It investigates whether the quality incentive strategies benefit the manufacturer′s quality improvement. Second, under the scenarios that the quality incentive contracts are offered by the retailer alone or by the supply chain enterprises through Nash bargaining, this study compares the results of the centralised model, the decentralised model, the quality cost-sharing model, and the revenue-sharing model. It investigates whether the quality incentive strategies can coordinate the supply chain and reveals the optimal quality incentive strategy (contract) and the optimal decision type of the quality incentive strategy (contract) to motivate the improvement of the quality and profitability of the supply chain. Finally, this study discusses the effects of product liability on the equilibrium results through numerical analysis. The equilibrium results show that (1) compared with the decentralisation case, both the quality cost-sharing contract (strategy) and the revenue-sharing contract ( strategy) can improve the quality level of the products, the profitability of the supply chain members, and the whole supply chain system effectively. However, the quality cost-sharing contract improves them over the revenuesharing contract. (2) Further, the quality level of the products, market demand, and retailer′s profit are higher under the retailer-led quality incentive strategies than under the Nash bargaining-led quality incentive strategies. In contrast, the manufacturer′s profit and the supply chain′s overall profit are higher under the Nash bargaining-led quality incentive strategies than under the retailer-led quality incentive strategies. This result reveals that a lower quality level and market demand can result in higher profitability for the total supply chain. Meanwhile, the Nash bargaining-led quality cost-sharing contract is the most effective strategy to improve the supply chain system′s profit. In addition, the numerical analysis results show that (1) the increase of the liability cost raises the supply chain members′ motivations to implement the quality cost-sharing contract. However, it decreases the motivation to implement the revenuesharing contract. (2) A high quality cost-sharing rate does not mean a high quality level and a high profitability for the supply chain system. (3) An increase in the product liability will not lead to an increase in the quality level and an increase in the profitability of the supply chain members and system © 2023, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We argue that insiders' decisions to trade in short windows before news announcements are likely to result from a trade-off between the incentives to capitalize on the foreknowledge of the disclosure and the risk of regulatory scrutiny and reputation loss. We provide evidence that the decision of insiders to buy is driven by this trade-off. We show that insiders strategically choose the amount of shares bought ahead of good news announcements, as they increase their purchases when the price impact of the news goes up, but the amount of shares purchased levels off as the news becomes extreme. In contrast, their sell trades are primarily influenced by the deterring effect of the regulatory and reputation risks, as the probability of their sell trades decreases significantly with the price impact of the forthcoming bad news. To further support our arguments on the importance of incentives and disincentives to trade, we show that the strategic trading is mainly observed in the most price-sensitive groups of news announcements, and is clearly pronounced for best informed executives (CEOs), and that the trading patterns change with changes in regulations, and insiders with higher reputational risk limit their trading ahead of bad news. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this article, the authors explore whether choice patterns are sensitive to the potential of relevant trade-offs to elicit negative emotion. Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects’ relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992). © 1999 American Marketing Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Anecdotal evidence indicates that in a gambling environment, consumers may end up betting more than they had initially planned. The authors assess this phenomenon in a series of three experiments, in which people are exposed to sequential and fair gambles in a two-stage process (planned and actual bets). The results show that in the planning phase, people behave conservatively, betting on average less after an anticipated loss and the same amount after an anticipated gain. However, after experiencing an actual loss in the first gamble, people bet in a subsequent gamble significantly more than they had initially planned, whereas on average, there were no observable differences from the plan after an actual gain. The reason for such asymmetry is due in part to people's tendency to underestimate, at the planning phase of the gamble, the impact of negative emotions in betting decisions during the actual phase of the gamble.\u001b[0m :\n",

Systematic mistakes in the ex-ante estimations of the distributions of outcomes after (independent) repeated plays were observed. Despite correctly realizing that outcome standard deviation increases with the number of plays, respondents showed evidence of Samuelson's (1963) fallacy of large numbers. Perceived risk judgments showed only low correlations with standard deviation estimates, but were instead related to the anticipated probability of a loss (which was overestimated), mean excess loss, and the coefficient of variation.

      "Abstract: Objective. - Patients whose migraines are frequent, cause disruptions of daily routines, or are unresponsive to acute treatment are primary candidates for preventive migraine therapy. This cost-effectiveness model assesses the clinical and economic impact of topiramate (TPM) therapy versus no preventive treatment for migraine headache in the United States. Background. - Despite significant progress in treatment options, the economic burden of migraine to patients, employers, health systems, and society is substantial. Treatment strategies for migraine are directed toward managing acute episodes. However, preventive therapy should be used for patients with frequent migraine attacks (>2 per month) or those experiencing attacks that disrupt daily routines. Methods. - Data for the model were obtained from the published literature and pooled results of two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of TPM in migraine prevention. Model inputs included baseline migraine frequency (the base case assumed 6 per month, consistent with the average rate in the TPM trials), treatment discontinuation (including discontinuation due to adverse events), treatment response (ie, ≥75%, 50% to 75%, and <50% reduction in migraine frequency), cost of preventive therapy (TPM plus physician visits for medication titration), cost of acute treatment per attack (including pharmacy and medical service costs), hours of disability per attack, hourly wage, and quality-of-life (utility) weights. Model outcomes included the number of migraines averted, disability hours, total cost of acute and preventive treatment, and lost wages. Results were expressed as cost per migraine averted and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). All costs were stated as 2002 U.S. dollars. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of model findings with respect to variation in key parameters. Results. - We estimated that the use of TPM would prevent 1.85 migraines per patient and almost 5 hours of disability per month versus no preventive treatment. Resulting savings in cost of acute treatment ($27) and work loss ($51) offset 68% of the expected monthly cost of TPM ($113). The incremental cost per migraine averted was $19, while the incremental cost per QALY was estimated to be $10,888 ($26,191 when indirect costs were excluded from the analysis). Model results were sensitive to baseline migraine rate and gain in health utility from migraine prevention. Conclusions. - Economic savings associated with reduced migraine frequency offset approximately two thirds of the cost of preventive TPM therapy. The cost-effectiveness of TPM depends on utility gains associated with a reduced frequency of migraine headaches, which is the subject of ongoing research. However, results from our model suggest that the use of TPM in prevention of migraine may offer reasonable value for money relative to many well-accepted medical interventions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Findings from a complex decision-making task (the Iowa gambling task) show that individuals with neuropsychological disorders are characterized by decision-making deficits that lead to maladaptive risk-taking behavior. This article describes a cognitive model that distills performance in this task into three different underlying psychological components: the relative impact of rewards and punishments on evaluations of options, the rate that the contingent payoffs are learned, and the consistency between learning and responding. Findings from 10 studies are organized by distilling the observed decision deficits into the three basic components and locating the neuropsychological disorders in this component space. The results reveal a cluster of populations characterized by making risky choices despite high attention to losses, perhaps because of difficulties in creating emotive representations. These findings demonstrate the potential contribution of cognitive models in building bridges between neuroscience and behavior. Copyright © 2005 American Psychological Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is an event-related brain potential component that is elicited by feedback stimuli indicating unfavorable outcomes. Until recently, the FRN has been studied primarily using experimental paradigms in which outcomes appeared to be contingent upon the participants' behavior. The present study further addressed the question whether an FRN can be elicited by outcomes that are not contingent on any preceding choice or action. Participants took part in a simple slot-machine task in which they experienced monetary gains and losses in the absence of responses. In addition, they performed a time estimation task often used to study the FRN and a flanker task known to elicit the error-related negativity. Outcomes in the slot-machine task elicited an FRN-like mediofrontal negativity whose amplitude correlated with the amplitude of the FRN associated with negative feedback in the time estimation task. However, the mediofrontal negativity was observed both for (unfavorable) outcomes that averted a gain and for (favorable) outcomes that averted a loss of money. The results are discussed in the framework of current conceptions of the FRN and related electrophysiological components. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Vagueness attitudes have been used to explain anomalies and irregularities in investment behavior. It is generally assumed (Ellsberg 1961) that decision makers (DMs) dislike vagueness, but this assumption has been challenged by empirical results documenting systematic alternative attitudes to vagueness as a function of its source, the domain of the decisions, and the response mode used. We investigate these three factors in a within-subjects design that was embedded in an investment context. DMs evaluated investment options that varied in terms of their sources of vagueness (probabilities and/or outcomes), in both domains (gains or losses), and employed two response modes (pricing or choice). We confirm that individuals' vagueness attitudes are malleable, contingent on the dimension salience and the reference domain. In particular, we observed three distinct patterns of \"reversals of attitudes\" towards vagueness. Our results indicate that the ability of vagueness attitudes to predict investment behavior is limited, as decisions can be systematically influenced by task context and/or perceived gain or loss positions. Economic models may be improved by incorporating more flexible assumptions about individuals' attitudes toward vagueness. © 2005 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Climate change is happening and people have begun to feel its impacts on their daily lives. Clear indications of these impacts can be seen on Himalayan glaciers, which are melting at rapid rates and consequently form massive glacial lakes (Figure 1), with a risk of catastrophic glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). GLOFs result in loss of lives, property, and costly infrastructure, as well as displacement of local people. They represent a particular threat in Nepal, where resources are already scarce. In least developed countries (LDCs) like Nepal, where poverty reduction is a national priority, the impact of climate change appears to be an obstacle to the process of sustainable development. Institutionalizing the climate change issue in national policies has now become an urgent need rather than a choice. As a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Nepal has agreed to take climate change considerations into account in its national development agenda. The first step was the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; the second is building the necessary institutional services such as a Designated National Authority (DNA), which is in the process of establishment. Moreover, climate change policies and strategies, the interconnections between different sectors, and coordination among different line ministries and government departments are issues to be addressed in the near future. WWF has initiated a Climate Witness Project to raise national and international awareness, and supports national efforts to shape adequate institutional responses to climate change.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In a previous study we addressed the question whether a feedback-related negativity (FRN) can be elicited by outcomes that are not contingent on any preceding choice or action (Donkers, Nieuwenhuis, & Van Boxtel, 2005). Participants took part in a simple slot-machine task in which they experienced monetary gains and losses in the absence of responses. In addition, they performed a time, estimation task often used to study the FRN, and a flanker task known to elicit the error-related negativity (Ne/ERN). Outcomes in the slot-machine task elicited a mediofrontal negativity whose amplitude correlated with the amplitude of the FRN associated with negative feedback in the time estimation task. However, the mediofrontal negativity was observed both for (unfavorable) outcomes that averted a gain and for (favorable) outcomes that averted a loss of money, a finding that is inconsistent with previous FRN research. In the present study we examined the similarity between the mediofrontal negativity observed in the slot-machine task and the frequency-sensitive N2. We manipulated the overall frequency of obtaining gains and losses in the slot-machine task and compared the negativities on averted gains and losses across the different trial probabilities. The results showed that larger feedback-related negativities were elicited by unexpected unfavorable outcomes than by expected unfavorable outcomes. © 2005 Federation of European Psychophysiology Societies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We estimate the value of three types of information about fire risk to a nonindustrial forest landowner: the relationship between fire arrival rates and stand age, the magnitude of fire arrival rates, and the efficacy of fuel reduction treatment. Our model incorporates planting density and the level and timing of fuel reduction treatment as landowner decisions. These factors affect, among other things, the loss a landowner incurs should fire arrive before harvesting. The value of information depends on the nature and combination of mistakes a landowner makes, the relationship between fire arrival and stand age, and on whether the landowner undertakes fuel treatment and values nontimber benefits. Information of various types is of most value to a landowner who does not undertake fuel treatment. The value of information about the magnitude of fire risk is also more than twice as high when the landowner underestimates fire risk, rather than overestimating it. For a landowner who undertakes fuel treatment but makes multiple mistakes, the asymmetry between overestimating and underestimating fire risk and efficacy of fuel reduction is even more pronounced. © 2005 NRC.\u001b[0m :\n",

A sample of household partners judged the fairness of a number of hypothetical decisions of a household partner, varying in the context of the decision. Decisions made by the partner to make a large personal expenditure or to reduce time spent on household chores were considered by the subjects as more fair if the outcome was framed as a forgone gain then if it was framed as a straight loss. Partners' decisions to reduce household chores were also considered as more fair in the case of overtime work than when the partner received a salary increase or windfall income. We conclude that asymmetric valuation of losses and forgone gains, and (behavioral) costs as compared with income increase of the partner, influenced the fairness judgments concerning the partner's behavior. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract: Objective: To calculate the cost effectiveness (from the Swedish healthcare perspective) of orlistat plus diet for an obese and overweight population in a 1-year weight-management responder programme versus a 1-year weight-management programme based on diet only. As a reference, orlistat plus diet and diet only were also compared with a no-diet alternative. Method: Costs and effectiveness were calculated in a decision-tree model by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Efficacy was derived from a pooled analysis of the orlistat clinical trial programme. Acquisition costs for orlistat (€, 2003 prices), healthcare costs for visits to doctors and dieticians related to weight management, and costs related to the difference in diabetes mellitus incidence between treatment arms were included in the analysis. The health benefit of temporary weight loss was measured in the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Results: The number of responding (those with >5% weight loss) patients at month 3 was almost twice as high with orlistat compared with diet only: 48.9% versus 26.3%. Responding orlistat patients had a weight loss of 15.5% at month 12 compared with 7.9% for all patients on diet only. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained versus diet only was estimated to be €13 125 for the average patient starting on orlistat. When orlistat was compared with no diet, the cost effectiveness was improved. However, comparing diet only with no diet gave a slightly higher ICER, indicating that orlistat had an extended dominance over the diet-only alternative. Conclusion: Our estimates indicated that orlistat in a 12-month dietary responder programme increased the number of QALYs and reduced the cumulative incidence of diabetes compared with diet only. Patients starting on orlistat in addition to a dietary programme achieved an ICER that was similar to many other well accepted healthcare treatment programmes. In order to improve the precision of our calculations, we need to confirm the key assumptions regarding temporary weight loss and utility gains, and the relationship between temporary weight loss and diabetes, as well as other co-morbidities, and to have better knowledge of the long-term impact of weight-management programmes in clinical practice, such as changes in weight-controlling behaviours and sustainability of weight loss. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV.

      "Abstract: Objective: The study aims to investigate whether laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a cost-effective strategy for managing gallbladder-stone disease compared to the conventional open cholecystectomy(OC) in a Thai setting. Design and Setting: Using a societal perspective a cost-utility analysis was employed to measure programme cost and effectiveness of each management strategy. The costs borne by the hospital and patients were collected from Chiang Rai regional hospital while the clinical outcomes were summarised from a published systematic review of international and national literature. Incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) derived from a decision tree model. Results: The results reveal that at base-case scenario the incremental cost per QALY of moving from OC to LC is 134,000 Baht under government perspective and 89,000 Baht under a societal perspective. However, the probabilities that LC outweighed OC are not greater than 95% until the ceiling ratio reaches 190,000 and 270,000 Baht per QALY using societal and government perspective respectively. Conclusion: The economic evaluation results of management options for gallstone disease in Thailand differ from comparable previous studies conducted in developed countries which indicated that LC was a cost-saving strategy. Differences were due mainly to hospital costs of post operative inpatient care and value of lost working time. The LC option would be considered a cost-effective option for Thailand at a threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product recommended by the committee on the Millennium Development Goals. © 2005 Teerawattananon and Mugford, licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People seem to learn tasks even without formal training. This can be modelled as the outcome of a feedback system that accumulates experience. In this paper we investigate such a feedback system, following an iterative research approach. A feedback loop is specified that is detailed using contemporary ideas on human behaviour. The resulting model is investigated in an empirical study. Finally, we consider a computational mechanism to explain the results. This approach is aimed at understanding how a feedback mechanism might work rather than at observing its outcomes. In this paper, we study the approach through adjustments in card selections in a game consisting of repeated card choices. Playing this game, participants do not know what rules determine gains and losses. Therefore there is some tension between exploring the options and achieving immediate profit. To decide in such situations it is argued that often evaluations below the level of conscious awareness, such as affect, play an important role. The results support the hypothesis that participants would draw better cards as the game progressed. There is some evidence that emotions are involved, since the hypothesis that profit and emotions are correlated is confirmed. Further evidence that formal logic is not sufficient follows from the observed effects of music on card selections. In the second part of the paper the aim is to understand the results from a computational point of view. Four possible ways of integrating feedback into a decision criterion are compared. Using one of these mechanisms, a computational model is investigated that might describe the role of music in card selection. Although there are limitations to both the empirical and computational findings, the chosen approach indicates that computational modelling of experiential appraisal, at a preconscious level, and the effect of external factors, such as music, is in principle feasible, and can lead to a research agenda aimed at understanding such phenomena. © Springer 2005.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been shown to reduce the severity and frequency of seizures for most patients. However, many patients experience adverse effects in order to maintain seizure control. Study design: A stated preference discrete choice experiment (DCE) was used to explore the preferences of people with epilepsy regarding the adverse effects and seizure control of AEDs. Methods: The main adverse effects of AEDs were identified through a literature search and expert consultation. In addition, a national epilepsy patient advocacy group helped to identify important attributes and commented on the attributes we had already identified. The DCE included five attributes related to adverse effects (alopecia, nausea, skin rash, concentration effects and weight change) plus seizure control and cost (to estimate willingness to pay [WTP]). A cost attribute was included in the DCE in order to estimate people's WTP for changes in attribute levels. Five hundred members of a national patient advocacy group with a diagnosis of epilepsy were presented with pairs of hypothetical drug profiles with varied levels of adverse effects, seizure control and cost; they were then asked to indicate which drug they preferred. Questions were also included to collect sociodemographic data (including income) and information regarding experience of adverse effects and medication. The survey was administered via the post and the Internet. Data were analysed using a random effects probit model. Results: A total of 148 surveys were returned. All attributes were significant and had the expected polarity, i.e. participants showed a preference for less severe adverse effects, greater seizure control and less cost. To achieve 100% seizure control and no adverse effects, participants were willing to pay £709 ($US1105) per month, 95% CI £451, £1278 (£1 = $US1.56, 2002 exchange rate). Participants' WTP was significantly influenced by different adverse effects; for example, people with epilepsy were willing to pay only £174 ($US271) per month for a drug that provided seizure freedom but also caused hair loss. Segmented models showed that seizure frequency has a significant negative impact on respondents' income levels. Also, women were willing to pay twice as much as men to avoid weight gain. Participants were also willing to trade changes in seizure control for improvements in adverse effects. Conclusion: Participants placed a high value on gaining total seizure control with no adverse effects. This study underlines the importance that people with epilepsy place on reducing adverse effects. The study also revealed how preferences for AEDs vary in different subgroups. Management of epilepsy is usually aimed at minimising seizures within a tolerable level of adverse effects. The present study suggests that people with epilepsy have strong preferences for reducing adverse effects as well as improving seizure control. These data may be considered useful when making medical management decisions in epilepsy. © 2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Reinforcing properties of psychoactive substances are considered to be critically involved in the development and maintenance of substance dependence. While accumulating evidence suggests that the sensitivity to reinforcement values may generally be altered in chronic substance users, relatively little is known about the influence reinforcing feedback exerts on ongoing decision-making in these individuals. Decision-making was investigated using the Cambridge Risk Task, in which there is a conflict between an unlikely large reward option and a likely small reward option. Responses on a given trial were analyzed with respect to the outcome on the previous trial, providing a measure of the impact of prior feedback in modulating behavior. Five different groups were compared: (i) chronic amphetamine users, (ii) chronic opiate users in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT), (iii) chronic users of illicit heroin, (iv) ex-drug users who had been long-term amphetamine/opiate users but were abstinent from all drugs of abuse for at least 1 year and (v) matched controls without a history of illicit substance use. Contrary to our predictions, choice preference was modified in response to feedback only in opiate users enrolled in MMT. Following a loss, the MMT opiate group chose the likely small reward option significantly less frequently than controls and heroin users. Our results suggest that different opiates are associated with distinctive behavioral responses to feedback. These findings are discussed with respect to the different mechanisms of action of heroin and methadone. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Palliative care researchers face many ethical and practical challenges. In particular, recruitment has proven difficult. New methodologies and methods need to be developed if barriers are to be overcome. This paper presents an example of a participatory approach to research with people receiving palliative care services. The approach was used for recruitment into an in-depth multi-methods study of weight loss and eating difficulties experienced by people with advanced cancer. Methods included a survey of patients on the case-loads of two community palliative care teams working in the South of England in 2003. The questionnaire was returned by 199 patients, 58% of the total patient population under the care of the two teams. Benefits of the approach taken are detailed, but also issues that emerged across the course of recruitment, thus highlighting points of interest for palliative care researchers. It is proposed that the success of the recruitment process can be attributed to the adoption of a context specific participatory approach. Successful recruitment into the study challenges the widely held belief that, for practical and ethical reasons, it is inappropriate to study people who are approaching the end of life. It demonstrates that a participatory approach enables clinical practice and research to share decision making and values, leading to a feasible and successful recruitment process that is acceptable to clinicians, researchers and patients. © 2005 Edward Arnold (Publishers) Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research on coalition formation has established that people will not hesitate to exclude others in order to maximize their payoff. The authors propose that this view is too narrow and that the decision to exclude depends on the valence of the payoff. Consistent with a \"do-no-harm\" hypothesis, Experiment 1 showed that participants were more reluctant to exclude in order to minimize their losses than to maximize their gains. Experiment 2 replicated this effect and showed that participants were most affected by payoff valence when they were disposed to consider the viewpoint of others. Additional analyses revealed that participants were more motivated by fairness (Experiment 1) and that fairness was more cognitively accessible (Experiment 2) when payoffs were negative rather than positive. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract: The fundamental concern of corporate governance is to ensure that the firm’s directors and managers act ethically in the interests of the firm and its shareholders and that the managers are held accountable to capital providers for the use of assets. Corporate governance issues are in general receiving greater attention as a result of the increasing recognition that a firm’s corporate governance affects both its economic performance and its ability to access long-term, low investment capital. However, business schools are sometimes blamed for having neglected corporate governance. We present here a conceptualization of governance from three different perspectives. • J J Irani strongly feels that values are coming back into demand once again. Responding to the apprehensions of critics about playing the game of business according to rules, he comments that being ethical does not mean losing on profits. According to him, it is, in fact, most important to make profits and to generate wealth because only then can one have the resources to do good for the community. What is important is to note that ethics cannot be imposed by law. It has to come through a change of mindset. • In Subir Raha’s opinion, while business has always been conducted for profit, the perception about profit has changed. It is now interpreted as creating value, creating wealth. Managers are required to create wealth ethically with concern not only for the company but also for the community. Corporate social responsibility is the way corporates interact, the way they get involved with people outside. The crucial issue in management is confronting the decisions — good or bad. Corporate governance is about making the right judgment in a given situation even if it involves risks. • Suresh Prabhu attributes all the problems in the country to the deteriorating standards of governance. Governance, in fact, is what we have created — the new functionaries with different responsibilities. If they deliver, governance would be of high order. Unfortunately, however, they do not deliver as the responsibilities and functions have not been codified. Reforming governance would mean overhauling the entire system. And, once public governance gets reformed, corporate governance would automatically improve. Following are the highlights emerging from the discussion: ➢ We need a change in our mindset which will allow us to use the superiority of our intellect to the advantage of corporate India. Training could help in mindset change. ➢ When confronted with the options of doing right or doing wrong, the managers need to test their judgment on their learning or value system in terms of corporate governance by doing the right thing that their training, knowledge, skill, judgment, and conscience tell them to do. The issue is the ability to make a judgment in a given situation and a given time and to confront the question: “Am I doing the right thing for my stakeholders?” ➢ If governance has to ultimately be reformed, the whole country has to change. We must go to the basics of the issue and start solving the problems. © 2005, SAGE Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Rationale: Many studies have reported the long-term adverse effects of alcohol on executive cognitive function in chronic alcohol abusers, yet little research has investigated the acute effects of alcohol in social drinkers. Studies on acute effects report alcohol-induced deficits on tasks that require executive cognitive processes, with alcohol acting to increase preservative errors and reduce planning. Aim: The present investigation examines the acute effects of a moderate dose of alcohol on a decision-making task that involves participants making a forced choice between two simultaneously presented binary-outcome gambles. Methods: Alcohol (0.6 g/kg) or placebo was administered to 32 social drinkers. Participants completed the task, making a total of 80 decisions about gambles that varied in the magnitude of expected gains, losses and the probability with which these outcomes were delivered. Participants also chose between gambles probing identified non-normative biases in human decision making, namely, risk aversion for choosing between gains and risk seeking for choosing between losses. Results: All participants picked the experimental gamble more frequently when the probability of winning was high vs low, when the gains were large vs small and when the losses were small vs large; the alcohol group had an impaired ability to factor in the magnitude of gains and the likelihood of winning when the losses were large. Deliberation time did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: These data suggest that alcohol given acutely impairs risky decision making. In particular, alcohol impairs one's ability to alter responding in light of changing prospective rewards in order to make favourable decisions. © Springer-Verlag 2005.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Analysis of binary choice behavior in iterated tasks with immediate feedback reveals robust deviations from maximization that can be described as indications of 3 effects: (a) a payoff variability effect, in which high payoff variability seems to move choice behavior toward random choice; (b) underweighting of rare events, in which alternatives that yield the best payoffs most of the time are attractive even when they are associated with a lower expected return; and (c) loss aversion, in which alternatives that minimize the probability of losses can be more attractive than those that maximize expected payoffs. The results are closer to probability matching than to maximization. Best approximation is provided with a model of reinforcement learning among cognitive strategies (RELACS). This model captures the 3 deviations, the learning curves, and the effect of information on uncertainty avoidance. It outperforms other models in fitting the data and in predicting behavior in other experiments. Copyright 2005 by the American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Neuroimaging studies on ADHD suggest abnormalities in brain regions associated with decision-making and reward processing such as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and orbitofrontal cortex. Recently, event-related potential (ERP) studies demonstrated that the ACC is involved in processing feedback signals during guessing and gambling. The resulting negative deflection, the 'feedback-related negativity' (FRN) has been interpreted as reflecting an error in reward prediction. In the present study, ERPs elicited by positive and negative feedback were recorded in children with ADHD and normal controls during guessing. 'Correct' and 'incorrect' guesses resulted in respectively monetary gains and losses. The FRN amplitude to losses was more pronounced in the ADHD group than in normal controls. Positive and negative feedback differentially affected long latency components in the ERP waveforms of normal controls, but not ADHD children. These later deflections might be related to further emotional or strategic processing. The present findings suggest an enhanced sensitivity to unfavourable outcomes in children with ADHD, probably due to abnormalities in mesolimbic reward circuits. In addition, further processing, such as affective evaluation and the assessment of future consequences of the feedback signal seems to be altered in ADHD. These results may further help understanding the neural basis of decision-making deficits in ADHD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Three experiments considered how the positive or negative framing of decisions affects children's EV (expected value) judgements and choices. In Experiment 1, 6- and 9-year-olds chose between a sure gain and a gamble or between a sure loss and a gamble, all with the same EV. Children preferred the sure thing more in the positive than negative frame, as also appears for adults. In Experiment 2, both frames involved potential losses. In their judgements, 6- and 9-year-olds used the normative multiplication rule for integrating risk and amount at risk, with minor frame differences, but when choosing between the same options, they were risk-averse in the save, risk-seeking in the loss frame. In Experiment 3, 5-year-olds used multiplication for saves, with an irregular pattern for losses. Overall, children's judgements conform closely to normativity. At the same time, children's choices, like adults', show non-normative framing effects. This décalage may reflect the involvement of more intuitive processes in judgement than choice. © by Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG,.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Much research has focused on the effects of reference prices on brand choice decisions using scanner panel data. The theory and application are well-documented and accepted. However, researchers have found contrary results on the existence of loss aversion in consumer goods markets. Loss aversion is a phenomenon based on the reference dependent theory that consumers respond more to losses (reference price < price) than to gains (reference price > price). The mixed results on the existence of loss aversion can be a result of not adequately accounting for consumer heterogeneity in response to marketing effects. Therefore, we focus our analysis on loss aversion and adequately accounting for consumer heterogeneity. We estimate a reference dependent model with a mixed logit specification that allows for a continuous distribution of response heterogeneity in the population. We use Gibbs Sampling to obtain individual estimates. Our estimation results from two different consumer goods categories, which show that the degree of loss aversion is small after properly accounting for heterogeneity. Further, we accomplish a posterior analysis and investigate whether the individual response to gains and losses can be attributed to consumer specific characteristics. The relation of the estimated individual specific variables to households' sociodemographic and psychographic variables as well as to observed purchase behavior reveal interesting insights into which consumers respond more or less to price deviations from their reference point. Hence, our results are important for the development of effective pricing strategies and the timing of price promotions. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although problem gambling and problem drinking often co-occur, the processes underlying this association are not well understood. This study investigated the effects of contingent gambling-drinking patterns and problem drinking severity on implicit gambling-alcohol associations. Participants were 144 (34 female) problem gamblers. The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) measured severity of problem gambling. The Brief Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (BMAST) measured severity of problem drinking. The Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 1464-1480) measured gambling-alcohol associations. Participants who reported drinking when they won displayed faster response time (i.e., priming) on trials where alcohol words were paired with gambling win (e.g., jackpot) vs. gambling loss (e.g., forfeit) words. The tendency to drink in response to losses did not influence the priming effect of win cues or moderate the effects of Win-Drinking Pattern on priming. Severity of problem drinking on the BMAST also correlated positively the priming effects of win cues. These findings indicate that a tendency to drink in response to gambling wins and more severe alcohol problems each coincide with stronger associations between gambling win and alcohol concepts in memory. Such associations can promote drinking and its attendant effects (e.g., poor decision-making) in problem gamblers, and thus, may contribute to co-morbid gambling and alcohol use disorders. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

An informational decision grid and two classification procedures were used to organize and link 246 written plans of 50 adults providing nearly 6 hours of care per day to a cognitively impaired parent. Results revealed 3 constellations of plans describing hands-on person-centred, instrumental, and grief-based approaches to caregiver planning. The 31 participants taking an instrumental approach to planning were significantly more likely than the 17 taking a grief-driven approach to report experiences of abandonment, betrayal, suicidal ideation, and use of alcohol. The 2 participants taking a person-centred approach reported significantly less emotional arousal and risk for loss of health and did not recount experiences of distress or emotion-focused coping.

      "Abstract: Involuntary resettlement of people displaced by large dams, as by several other development projects, is largely considered a failure. Increasingly, researchers have shifted focus from trying to improve welfare outcomes for the affected to questioning the involuntariness of resettlement schemes. The idea of voluntary resettlement, under which the displaced are consulted regarding their resettlement, is often suggested as a preferred alternative. The problem of 'incentive incompatibility', however, suggests that, if asked for an evaluation of their losses, the affected have an incentive to exaggerate. In this paper the author explores the possibility of using the contingent valuation method - a method often used to make decisions about environmental issues - to consult the affected without capitulating to this problem.

      "Abstract: While the concept of \"expected utility\" informs many theories of decision making, little is known about whether and how the human brain might compute this quantity. This article reviews a series of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) experiments designed to localize brain regions that respond in anticipation of increasing amounts of monetary incentives. These studies collectively suggest that anticipation of increasing monetary gains activates a subcortical region of the ventral striatum in a magnitude-proportional manner. This ventral striatal activation is not evident during anticipation of losses. Actual gain outcomes instead activate a region of the mesial prefrontal cortex. During anticipation of gain, ventral striatal activation is accompanied by feelings characterized by increasing arousal and positive valence. These findings affirm the role of emotion in the anticipation of incentives, and may provide an initial step towards a neural reconstruction of expected utility. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract: Effective movement planning should take into account the consequences of possible errors in executing a planned movement. These errors can result from either sensory uncertainty or variability in movement planning and production. We examined the ability of humans to compensate for variability in sensory estimation and movement production under conditions in which variability is increased artificially by the experimenter. Subjects rapidly pointed at a target region that had an adjacent penalty region. Target and penalty hits yielded monetary rewards and losses. We manipulated the task-relevant variability by perturbing visual feedback of finger position during the movement. The feedback was shifted in a random direction with a random amplitude in each trial, causing an increase in the task-relevant variability. Subjects were unable to counteract this form of perturbation. Rewards and penalties were based on the perturbed, visually specified finger position. Subjects rapidly acquired an estimate of their new variability in <120 trials and adjusted their aim points accordingly. We compared subjects' performance to the performance of an optimal movement planner maximizing expected gain. Their performance was consistent with that expected from an optimal movement planner that perfectly compensated for externally imposed changes in task-relevant variability. When exposed to novel stimulus configurations, aim points shifted in the first trial without showing any detectable trend across trials. These results indicate that subjects are capable of changing their pointing strategy in the presence of externally imposed noise. Furthermore, they manage to update their estimate of task-relevant variability and to transfer this estimate to novel stimulus configurations.

Assuming cumulative prospect theory, utility functions were elicited for gains and losses at an individual level using the tradeoff method. Subsequently, decision weights were elicited through certainty equivalents of uncertain two-outcome prospects. Furthermore, decision weights were decomposed using observable choice instead of invoking other empirical primitives, as in previous experimental studies. The choice-based elicitation of decision weights allows for a quantitative study of their characteristics, and also allows, among other things, for the examination of the sign-dependence hypothesis for observed choice under uncertainty. Our results confirm concavity of the utility function in the gain domain and bounded subadditivity of decision weights and choice-based subjective probabilities. We also find evidence for sign dependence of decision weights. © 2005 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

We estimated life expectancy for the 26 patients who hastened their deaths and used content analysis to identify patterns in their decisions. On average, patients had lived with their illness for 2.5 years and had actively planned their deaths for 3 months. Those with less than a week to live (n = 10) were 'dying and done,' having experienced a final functional loss that signaled the end. Those with <1 month (n = 8) were 'dying, but not fast enough.' Those with 1-6 months (n = 5) saw a 'looming crisis' on their horizon that would prohibit following through with their plans. The 3 patients with >6 months were 'not recognized by others as dying, but suffering just the same.' Clinicians should regularly assess where patients perceive they are in the dying process and ask about their comfort with the pace of dying to identify opportunities for intervention. © 2005 U.S. Cancer Pain Relief Committee.

To answer this question, we investigated how normal participants, patients with stable focal lesions in brain regions related to emotion (target patients), and patients with stable focal lesions in brain regions unrelated to emotion (control patients) made 20 rounds of investment decisions. Target patients made more advantageous decisions and ultimately earned more money from their investments than the normal participants and control patients. When normal participants and control patients either won or lost money on an investment round, they adopted a conservative strategy and became more reluctant to invest on the subsequent round; these results suggest that they were more affected than target patients by the outcomes of decisions made in the previous rounds.

It is shown that the total mortality impact (measured by cohort studies) can only be quantified in terms of loss of life expectancy (LLE), not number of premature deaths. Time-series (TS) studies of mortality observe only acute impacts, that is, deaths due to short-term exposure (\"acute mortality\"); they allow the estimation of a number of deaths without providing any information on the LLE per death. However, even if the average loss per death is as long as 6 mo, acute mortality is only a very small percentage of the total mortality attributable to air pollution. Estimates of the population-average LLE due to air pollution are provided, for acute mortality, total adult mortality, and infant mortality. Copyright© Taylor & Francis Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The knowledge to-date recaps Coffea arabica to have originated in Ethiopia and its genetic diversity in the country is proved to be high. However, this diversity is threatened due to policy, institutional and market failures. Despite a tremendous attention to salvage this loss through on-farm conservation, there is no adequate contextual research done as to how this strategy can be harmonized with farmers' livelihood strategies and how policy can face the potential trade-off with modern technology adoption. Understanding farmers' preferences for variety attributes is important in the implementation of sensible on-farm conservation and variety adoption strategies since it offers policy directions to harmonized trade-offs and capitalize on synergies. To this end, the paper studies farmers preferences for distinct coffee variety attributes - yield, yield stability, marketability and environmental adaptability. Using a utility maximazation framework and drawing on Lancaster's characteristic model, farmers' preferences for variety attributes are derived as an outcome of their livelihood decisions. Following this, a multinomial logit model is estimated. The data come from 266 coffee growing farmers in southwestern Ethiopia. The result have shown various factors inducing or deterring farmers' preferences for the studied variety attributes. Based on the empirical results, the paper derives policy implications on on-farm conservation and improved coffee variety adoption in Ethiopia.\u001b[0m :\n",

With the aim of demonstrating that such escalation of commitment is a special case of a more general phenomenon, two experiments were carried out employing undergraduates as participants. Experiment 1 showed for fictitious personal and business investment scenarios that both prior losses and gains (sunk outcomes) affected choices to continue or discontinue the investment. In Experiment 2 the effect of sunk outcomes was reduced although not eliminated by a monetary bonus that in one condition depended on the future outcomes of the second gamble in two-stage gambles, in another condition on the future returns in personal investment scenarios. In support of a more inclusive theory subsuming escalation of commitment, the decisions were affected by both past and future outcomes and both gains and losses. © 2005 Psychology Press Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In an experiment decision-makers used time series information on the past demand for products to decide on production levels to meet the next period's demand. Either shortages cost more per unit than surpluses or the asymmetry of losses was in the opposite direction. The decision-makers were either: (i) unsupported, (ii) provided with statistical point forecasts of the next period's demand or (iii) asked to estimate probability distributions of next period's demand using the fractile method-the decisions were inferred from these distributions (Decomposition). Providing statistical forecasts led to decisions incurring significantly lower expected costs than those achieved by the unsupported decision makers. However, the decomposition procedure did not significantly reduce expected costs because, contrary to earlier evidence, the fractile method generally led to distributions that were too wide and fiat. Decision-makers in both treatments (i) and (ii) also performed significantly better when shortages were more costly than surpluses. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many survivors of head injury suffer chronic personality changes, such as increased impulsivity and a lack of insight and poor judgment. These changes are well recognized and likely to affect the ability to make decisions. However, systematic investigations into their nature have been limited. This study aims to explore the nature of decision making in head injury survivors using a computerized task. Forty-three head injury survivors and a group of 29 matched controls completed the computerized task. The task required participants to make a probability-based choice and to further qualify this choice with an associated \"bet.\" This betting component allows an assessment of the participant's level of confidence in the decision, via the affective evaluation of its possible consequences in terms of points won or lost. The survivors were found to be slow at making the probability-based choice. Whilst at highly favorable odds, the survivors chose the most likely option in a similar manner to the controls, they chose the most likely option less often than the controls at less favorable odds. Examination of the survivors' betting behavior revealed that they responded impulsively compared to controls. This pattern of prolonged decision making and poor quality of decisions is similar to that found in patients with orbitofrontal cortex lesions, whilst impulsive betting has been associated with abnormalities of the dopamine system. These complex deficits in decision making may contribute to difficulties with poor judgment and inhibition in head injury survivors. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective. Despite the serious consequences of osteoporosis, few women use pharmacologic measures to prevent postmenopausal bone loss. We used an interactive computerized questionnaire to examine women's preferences for prevention of osteoporosis. Methods. We administered a choice-based conjoint analysis survey (CBCA) to consecutive early postmenopausal women in a shopping center. The questionnaire was constructed to measure preferences for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic measures to prevent postmenopausal bone loss. Women were also given the option of choosing \"none,\" i.e., to defer or refuse all options. Utilities were calculated based on a Hierarchical Bayes model using Monte Carlo-Markov chain algorithms. We performed simulations based on women's values for specific treatment characteristics to estimate choice. Results. A total of 212 women agreed to complete the survey (42% participation rate). Between 18% and 47% of the women surveyed (mean age 52 ± yrs) were predicted to choose once-weekly medications to prevent postmenopausal bone loss, assuming treatment confers an absolute lifetime risk reduction in fractures of at least 10%. Conclusion. In this CBCA survey, which derived preferences based on how women make tradeoffs between specific treatment characteristics, a significant percentage of women were willing to use once-weekly medications to prevent postmenopausal bone loss.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Older adults process emotional information differently than younger adults and may demonstrate less of a negativity bias on cognitive tasks. The Iowa Gambling Task designed by A. Bechara, H. Damasio, D. Tranel, and A. R. Damasio (1997) has been used to examine the integration of emotion and cognition in a risky-choice decision task and may give insight into differences in the decision-making strategies in younger and older adults. Eighty-eight younger adults (18-34 years) and 67 older adults (65-88 years) completed the Iowa Gambling Task. Using a theoretical decomposition of the task designed by J. R. Busemeyer and J. C. Stout (2002), the authors found that both groups were successful at solving the task but used very different strategies that reflected each group's strength. For younger adults, that strength was learning and memory. For older adults, that strength was an accurate representation of wins and losses (valence).

      "Abstract: This paper analyzes the decision of a firm offering two versions of a product, a deluxe and a regular. While both products satisfy the same market, the deluxe version is sold at a high price relative to its cost and is aimed at the high end of the demand curve. The regular version is sold at a low price relative to its cost and is targeted to customers at the low end of the demand curve. This two-offering strategy is especially popular with book publishers where a paperback book is introduced some tune after the hardbound version is introduced. The time between the introduction of the two versions of the product is accompanied by a downward shift in the demand curve due to customers losing interest in the product or satisfying their demand from a secondary used market. We solve a profit maximization model for a firm using a two-offering strategy. The model is solved for linear and exponential deterioration in demand, which is assumed to be deterministic. Also, a model with linear deterioration in demand, which is assumed to be stochastic, is solved. The results indicate that substantial improvements in profit can be obtained by using the two-offering strategy. Numerical sensitivity analysis and examples are used to illustrate the results. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: On a gambling task that models real-life decision making, children between ages 7 and 12 perform like patients with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), opting for choices that yield high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses (Crone & Van der Molen, 2004). The current study set out to characterize developmental changes in decision making by varying task complexity and punishment frequency. Three age groups (7-9years, 10-12 years, 13-15 years) performed two versions of a computerized variant of the original Iowa gambling task. Task complexity was manipulated by varying the number of choices participants could make. Punishment frequency was manipulated by varying the frequency of delayed punishment. Results showed a developmental increase in the sensitivity to future consequences, which was present only when the punishment was presented infrequently. These results could not be explained by differential sensitivity to task complexity, hypersensitivity to reward, or failure to switch response set after receiving punishment. There was a general pattern of boys outperforming girls by making more advantageous choices over the course of the task. In conclusion, 7-12-year-old children-like VMPFC patients-appear myopic about the future except when the potential for future punishment is high. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous studies have established a relationship between marijuana use and risky behavior in natural settings. A limited number of laboratory investigations of marijuana effects on human risk taking have been conducted. The present study was designed to examine the acute effects of smoked marijuana on human risk taking, and, to identify behavioral mechanisms that may be involved in drug-induced changes in the probability of risky behavior. Using a laboratory measure of risk taking designed to address acute drug effects, 10 adults were administered placebo cigarettes and three doses of active marijuana cigarettes (half placebo and half 1.77%; 1.77%; and 3.58% Δ9- THC) in a within-subject repeated-measures experimental design. The risk-taking task presented subjects with a choice between two response options operationally defined as risky and nonrisky. Data analyses examined cardiovascular and subjective effects, response rates, distribution of choices between the risky and nonrisky option, and first-order transition probabilities of trial-by-trial data. The 3.58% THC dose increased selection of the risky response option, and uniquely shifted response probabilities following both winning and losing outcomes following selection of the risky option. Acute marijuana administration thereby produced measurable changes in risky decision making under laboratory conditions. Consistent with previous risk-taking studies, shifts in trial-by-trial response probabilities at the highest dose suggested a change in sensitivity to both reinforced and losing risky outcomes. Altered sensitivity to consequences may be a mechanism in drug-induced changes in risk taking. Possible neurobiological sites of action related to THC are discussed. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To explore the views of bereaved relatives about quality of survival after radiotherapy for malignant cerebral glioma. Design: Semistructured interviews with the bereaved relatives of 56 previously studied patients with glioma. Setting: Patients treated at six London hospitals from 1990 to 1992 surviving between one and 46 months (median, eight). Subjects: Fifty six relatives (44 spouses, 12 others) seen four to six months after bereavement and 20 again at 13 months. Main outcome measures: Views about quality of life and satisfaction with radiotherapy. Results: Relatives described quality of life as \"good or acceptable\" when patients carried on some normal activities or enjoyed social relationships. They described restricted and dependent states, constant deterioration, or loss of social interaction as giving \"poor or unacceptable\" quality of life. Length of time lived in such states also appeared important. Relatives' views of good or acceptable quality of life were independently related to low initial cognitive or personality change or low distress in the patient after diagnosis, and to their subsequent survival free from physical disability for at least one month. Satisfaction with radiotherapy was related to low initial distress, some degree of surgical resection, and overall length of survival longer than six months. Conclusions: Carefully exploring the views of bereaved relatives can bring a useful perspective to difficult treatment decisions. Their values support including disability and distress in quality of life measures, but cast doubt on the QALY-type approach of using full years of survival or time free from disability to judge whether treatments are worthwhile.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: There is a well-established relationship between poor executive cognitive abilities and elderly fall risk, but the precise mechanism underlying this relationship is unknown. Older persons frequently fall or trip on objects below eye level, and it was hypothesized that the pathological mechanism linking low executive function and fall risk is a selective impairment in the resolution of visual attention in the lower visual fields. Objective: To determine if normally sighted older persons living in the community with deficits in executive cognitive abilities have a reduced resolution of visual attention in the lower visual fields compared to elderly and younger subjects with high executive abilities. Methods: Eye and head angulations were monitored as subjects fixated on a point rear-projected at eye level at the end of a 3-meter walkway. Visual stimuli were briefly presented (<300 ms) in the peripheral visual field (with and without distractors) to directly cue the selection of the right or left foot to lead a step over a foam obstacle resting at the subject's feet. No saccades were allowed until the stimulus was extinguished, at which time a down-saccade-step sequence moved the foot over the obstacle. The resolution of visual attention (tested with gratings) and the influence of target eccentricity in the upper and lower visual fields were evaluated. The primary outcome measures were step error and obstacle contact rate, saccade occurrence after extinguished stimulus and the log of cue-saccade latency (limb-independent reaction time). Results: All groups experienced greater stepping errors than expected by chance when stimuli were presented in the lower versus upper visual field and with increasing eccentricity. However, the obstacle contact rate was greater, cue-saccade latency was prolonged, and fewer down-saccades were generated in the elderly group with poor executive abilities compared to those with high executive function and younger subjects. Conclusions: Loss of visual attention in the lower visual fields was not unique to elderly subjects with poor executive function. However, slowed processing time and reduction in the frequency of down-saccades associated with a low level of executive function potentially account for the mechanism linking executive abilities and fall risk.

      "Abstract: Electronic commerce and the Internet have enabled businesses to reduce costs, attain greater market reach, and develop closer partner and customer relationships. However, using the Internet has led to new risks and concerns. This paper provides a management perspective on the issues confronting CIO's and IT managers: it outlines the current state of the art for security in e-commerce, the important issues confronting managers, security enforcement measure/techniques, and potential threats and attacks. It develops a scheme for probabilistic evaluation of the impact of security threats with some illustrative examples. This methodology may be used to assess the probability of success of attacks on information assets in organizations, and to evaluate the expected damages of these attacks. The paper also outlines some possible remedies, suggested controls and countermeasures. Finally, it proposes the development of cost models which quantify damages of these attacks and the effort of confronting these attacks. The construction of one such cost model for security risk assessment is also outlined. It helps decision makers to select the appropriate choice of countermeasure(s) to minimize damages/losses due to security incidents. Finally, some recommendations for future work are provided to improve the management of security in organizations on the whole. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.\u001b[0m :\n",

A winner's curse phenomenon arises when subjects bid too high and make losses. Learning direction theory can account for this. However, other influences on behaviour can also be identified. We introduce impulse balance theory to make quantitative predictions on the basis of learning direction theory. We also look at monotonic ladder processes.

      "Abstract: Sellers often explicitly suggest to buyers that they compare one option to other (reference) options. Building on the notion that loss aversion is more pronounced when comparisons are explicit rather than implicit, we propose that the mere fact that consumers are explicitly told to make particular comparisons induces more risk-averse, cautious choice and bidding behavior. This proposition was supported in a field experiment involving real online auctions, in which comparisons among listings either were done spontaneously by bidders or were encouraged using an explicit instruction to compare the focal auction with adjacent listings. Results showed that explicit reference points (1) diminished the influence of adjacent auction prices on the focal auction's price; (2) led participants to submit fewer, lower, and later bids; (3) increased the incidence of sniping; (4) decreased bidding frenzy; and (5) decreased the tendency to bid on multiple items simultaneously. The impact of explicit comparisons on risk-averse behavior was further tested in a very different context using a laboratory choice experiment. In that study, explicit instructions to compare option sets increased the tendency to choose the compromise, low-risk, and all-average alternatives. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this research. © 2005 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

During the 1990s, when the societal costs for covering sickness absence raised dramatically, the sickness insurance underwent several changes, which raised questions about how people reacted to the changes made. This article is based on a survey where individuals were asked several questions about whether they would go to work or report sick, given that they actually felt ill. Respondents were asked the same questions under different hypothetical compensations.

      "Abstract: E-commerce has proved to be fertile ground for new business models, which may be patented (for up to 20 years) and have potentially far-reaching impact on the e-commerce landscape. One such electronic market is the reverse-auction model popularized by Priceline.com. There is still uncertainty surrounding the survival of such new electronic markets currently available on the Internet. Understanding user behavior is necessary for better assessment of these sites' survival. This paper adds to economic analysis a formal representation of the emotions evoked by the auction process, specifically, the excitement of winning if a bid is accepted, and the frustration of losing if it is not. We generate and empirically test a number of insights related to (1) the impact of expected excitement at winning, and frustration at losing, on bids across consumers and biddings scenarios; and (2) the dynamic nature of the bidding behavior - that is, how winning and losing in previous bids influence their future bidding behavior. © 2005 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this study, we incorporate taxpayers' threat/opportunity perceptions into our analysis of taxpayer behavior in order to refine and extend our understanding of the internal cognitive forces that shape taxpayer behavior. Decision-making frames (that is, the gain and loss domains from the prospect theory value function) and individual perceptions (that is, perceptions of decision alternatives as being threats or opportunities) are both likely to influence behavior, yet prior research has generally ignored the behavioral effects of individual perceptions. The results of our experiment reveal that taxpayers who are due a tax refund (owe additional taxes) prior to considering a judgemental tax deduction tend to perceive the conservative (aggressive) tax deduction to be more of an opportunity/less of a threat. In turn, we find that taxpayer frames have a direct effect on taxpayer behavior and an indirect effect on behavior through their effect on taxpayers' threat/opportunity perceptions. Perhaps the most important message of this study is that researchers can advance our understanding of the internal cognitive processes that shape taxpayer behavior by incorporating taxpayer perceptions into their research designs. © CAAA.\u001b[0m :\n",

It turns out that inequity averse agents exert higher efforts than purely self-interested agents for a given prize structure. Contrary to standard tournament theory, first-best efforts cannot be implemented when prizes are endogenous.

Bariatric surgery is a life-changing procedure that requires a long-term commitment from the individual. Objective: The purpose of this research was to explore issues relating to having a surgical procedure performed to lose weight. Study design: A phenomenological study was conducted. The sample included five females and three males who had undergone surgery to reduce weight at least 1 year prior to the study participation. Results: Qualitative data analysis revealed the following four themes: last resort, surgery provides structure, reality sets in, and positive about the decision to have the surgery. Conclusion: Understanding these themes offers much needed information for health professionals when treating the morbidly obese person. Psychiatric nurses and psychiatric advanced practice nurses can offer a holistic approach and implement programs that incorporate study findings into individual treatment plans. Nurse psychotherapists can explore these findings in therapy sessions and focus on the impact they have on the person's goals to maintain weight loss.

      "Abstract: We examined the factors affecting the outcome of cricket matches played in the English one-day county cricket league. In particular, we focused on the home-field effect and the importance of winning the pre-match toss of a coin to determine a team's strategic decision to bat first or second. A home-field effect appeared to be confirmed in that home teams won 57% of all matches with a win/loss result. A logistical regression model was used, with the outcome variable defined in terms of a home team win/loss. We found that while winning the toss is an important aspect of a one-day cricket match, other factors tend to dominate in determining the result, especially team quality and match importance for the home and away teams in the overall league context. Our results also indicate, not surprisingly given the nature of cricket attendance and spectating, that the crowd effect is largely insignificant. The results of our study do not support any rule changes requiring the abandonment of the coin toss to determine batting order. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The standard gamble has a firm basis in the theory of risk and, for this reason, is the preferred method of health state value elicitation for many researchers. However, it is widely recognised that the use of immediate death as the failure outcome in the standard gamble renders the method insufficiently sensitive for the direct valuation of minor and temporary health states. Consequently, the indirect valuation of minor and temporary health states through a process of 'chaining' has been recommended. Unfortunately, a number of researchers have observed internal inconsistency in the standard gamble. That is, for health states that are not thought to be subject to the above mentioned insufficient sensitivity, the values elicited from indirect chained questions quite often significantly and systematically exceed those elicited from the direct procedure. A potential explanation for this is the possible influence of loss aversion when people are asked to weigh certainty against risk. The lottery equivalents method, an alternative value elicitation instrument that also has a firm grounding in the theory of risk, modifies the standard gamble approach of certainty versus risk to one of risk versus risk. The absence of certainty offers reason to suspect that the influence of loss aversion will be diminished (or even removed), and that the lottery equivalents method will thus prove to be internally consistent. The study reported in this article tests the internal consistency of the lottery equivalents method. In a manner similar to that observed with the standard gamble, the results indicate that the internal consistency of the lottery equivalents method is also to some extent compromised.

      "Abstract: Objective: The false-hope syndrome suggests that unrealistic expectations about dieting set dieters up for failure and then promote renewed efforts at weight loss. Many dieters believe the inflated promises typical of diet advertisements, which may be the source of at least some of their unrealistic expectations. Diet advertisements promoting unrealistic expectations were expected to inspire restrained eaters to diet and lead to enhanced self-perceptions, relative to more circumspect advertisements. Method: Female undergraduates rated their expectations in response to a control advertisement or to advertisements containing realistic, moderately unrealistic, or highly unrealistic promises of dieting. Participants then rated their self-perceptions and participated in an apparent \"taste-test\". Results: Restrained eaters had higher expectations for themselves than did unrestrained eaters, and restrained and unrestrained eaters had similar expectations concerning dieting for others. Those who viewed the advertisements containing unrealistic expectations ate fewer cookies ad libitum than did those who viewed the realistic or control advertisements. Discussion: This finding is consistent with the suggestion that unrealistic expectations contribute to the decision to change oneself. © 2005 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The safe dissemination of statistical tabular data is one of the main concerns of National Statistical Institutes (NSIs). Although each cell of the tables is made up of the aggregated information of several individuals, the statistical confidentiality can be violated. NSIs must guarantee that no individual information can be derived from the released tables. One widely used type of methods to reduce the disclosure risk is based on the perturbation of the cell values. We consider a new controlled perturbation method which, given a set of tables to be protected, finds the closest safe ones - thus reducing the information loss while preserving confidentiality. This approach means solving a quadratic optimization problem with a much larger number of variables than constraints. Real instances can provide problems with millions of variables. We show that interior-point methods are an effective choice for that model, and, also, that specialized algorithms which exploit the problem structure can be faster than state-of-the art general solvers.

      "Abstract: Purpose – In forecasting unknown quantities, risk and finance decision makers often rely on one or more biased experts, statistical specialists representing parties with an interest in the decision maker's final forecast. This problem arises in a variety of contexts, and the decision maker may represent a corporate enterprise, rating agency, government regulator, etc. The purpose of the paper is to assist decision makers, experts, and others to have a better understanding of the dynamics of the problem, and to adopt strategies and practices that enhance efficiency. Design/methodology/approach – The problem is formulated as a two-person, non-cooperative Bayesian game with the decision maker and one expert as players, and perfect Bayesian equilibrium solutions are identified. Then the analysis is extended to variations of the game in which the expert's loss function is not common knowledge, and in which there are multiple experts. Findings – In the struggle for information between the decision maker and the experts, the experts generally benefit from greater uncertainty about the parameters of the model. Thus, in attempting to elicit as much information as possible from the experts, the decision maker must strive to minimize all sources of uncertainty. Research limitations/implications – As in most Bayesian games, the analysis requires that a variety of process assumptions and model parameters be common knowledge. These conditions may be difficult to satisfy in real-world applications. Practical implications – The principal finding of the study is that there is truly a struggle for information between the decision maker and the experts. This generally encourages the experts to inject as much uncertainty as possible into the process. To counter this effect, the decision maker might: provide incentives for the experts to increase their sampling information; try to mitigate specific uncertainties regarding the model parameters; and try to increase the number of experts. Originality/value – This is the first paper to apply the framework of signaling games to the problem of eliciting information from biased experts. It is of value to decision makers, experts, and economic researchers. © 2005, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background Parents with learning difficulties are known to face a high risk of losing their children. This paper reports findings from a study designed to throw light on the numbers of parents with learning difficulties and their children coming before the Family Courts in Children Act proceedings and what happened to them as a result. Method The paper presents descriptive information on the characteristics of the parents and children, the basis of professional concerns in these cases, and details of the final outcomes and placement decisions extracted from a documentary review of court files. Results Parents with learning difficulties were found to be disproportionately represented in care proceedings and their children were significantly more likely to be freed for adoption than the children of any other group of parents. Conclusions On the basis of the research evidence, parents with learning difficulties appear to be treated more harshly because of their disability, raising the question of the interface between disability discrimination legislation and the Children Act in such cases. © 2005 BILD Publications.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We consider a system of heterogeneous agents playing the Minority Game on two markets. At each time step, each agent plays on one of the markets only. The agents can change the market according to some switching scheme. Various switching schemes are investigated: those that depend on the performance of the agents on each of the markets, and those that determine the actual market as a function of the number of games lost on the markets. We discuss the influence of the chosen switching scheme on the overall performance of the system of agents. In particular, we study both aggregate attendance (price returns) and volatilities for various schemes of the market choice. © World Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: • Summary: Very little is known about the almost a million unmarried fathers whose children were lost to adoption in England and Wales in the mid-20th century.1 Between the first Adoption Act and the present day nearly 900,000 adoptions have taken place. • Findings: In the context of the social conditions of the years between 1926 and the present, the data report the experiences and reflect the emotions of the original fathers concerning the discovery of their partner’s pregnancy, the process of the child’s adoption and their searching and sometimes reunion with their adult adopted individuals. The study consists of self-selected contributors and does not claim to be representative of all unmarried fathers. • Applications: The reasons why these men were excluded from the decision concerning the child’s adoption are posited. Original parents now have the right to apply for information concerning their adopted adult children and it is likely that social workers will be contacted by the original fathers as well as other individuals in the biological family. © 2005, Sage Publications.

      "Abstract: Taking two conceptualizations of risk, Dickson and Giglierano's [J. Mark. 50 (1986) 58] nautical analogy of entrepreneurial risk (sinking vs. missing the boat) to represent the likelihood of loss element of new venture risk, and March and Shapira's [Manage. Sci. 33 (1987) 1404] risk as hazard (boat size) to represent the magnitude of loss element of new venture risk, we investigated how two contextual factors, the suitability of entrepreneurs' skills and their sources of funds, and two individual differences factors, the entrepreneurs' risk propensities and their perceptions of risk, influence their new venture decision making. Metaphorically speaking, we found that most entrepreneurs would rather risk missing than sinking the boat, and that they preferred to pilot bigger craft than smaller ones. Perhaps surprisingly, our sample of highly successful entrepreneurs made relatively risk-averse choices, with 83% choosing either of the two ventures for which the chances for loss were lowest. We also found that the source of new venture funding-the entrepreneur's own money versus that of investors-influenced our subjects' choices between ventures whose chances for loss or gain differed. A similar effect was found for the entrepreneur's risk propensity . On the other hand, we found that the risk the entrepreneurs perceived in the choice set also influenced choices, but only where the magnitude of the new venture's potential gain or loss varied. When viewed in total, our study and results suggest a risk-and reward-based typology of new venture opportunities, one that may provide a conceptual foundation for future explorations of a variety of questions relevant for entrepreneurs and theorists alike. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract: Estuaries play an important role as a buffer zone between the land-based activities and the inshore marine environment. However, little is known about community values for the environmental services estuaries provide. Choice Modelling, a non-market economic valuation technique, was applied to estimate the non-use values associated with protecting the environmental health of the Fitzroy estuary in the Great Barrier Reef catchment area. Non-use values are held by people who do not directly use the estuary themselves, but may still value it for its natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides. A survey sample was selected from a remote population (Brisbane, 700 km from the estuary), where it was unlikely that many respondents had used the estuary and so the values elicited reflected a non-use component of value. Results indicated that Brisbane households were willing to pay $3.21 per year for a one per cent improvement in the environmental health of the Fitzroy estuary. Results also revealed that losses in environmental health were valued differently to gains.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We presented a Web questionnaire to 139 physicians and medical researchers and 109 laypeople. The subjects made judgments of badness and importance of prevention for eight medical conditions at each of seven different probability levels. By assuming that the response to each of the 56 risks was monotonically related to transformations of the probability and of the disutility of the condition, we could assess the relative effect of probability and disutility on each subject's judgments. Physicians' judgments were more sensitive than laypeople's judgments to changes in probability. Older and female laypeople were less sensitive to probability (and correspondingly, more responsive to differences in severity among medical conditions). Laypeople varied more than physicians in their responsiveness to probability. These results point to general individual differences in the effect of probability on evaluations of medical risks. They may also provide insight into causes and noncauses of physician-patient miscommunication. Copyright 2005 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Agency theoretic models have been used in the past to justify the use of stock options as an effective incentive alignment mechanism to create a common fate between principals and agents. In this paper, we use behavioral theory to reach the opposite conclusion-namely, that the design characteristics of the typical stock option plan foster perverse incentives for loss-averse agents, leading to decisions with detrimental consequences for principals. We also consider alternative stock option designs and other equity-based executive compensation plans and argue that they may suffer from the same problems as traditional stock option plans-namely, that loss-averse executives will try to protect the endowed value of that equity through self-serving decisions that do not enhance shareholder wealth. © 2005 M.E.

      "Abstract: This article analyzes the impacts of global economic restructuring on the life course of Thai women workers by using a case study of a community in Bangkok. In the 1980s, the growth of labor-intensive industries was a main driving force behind the economic growth of Thailand, and women manual workers were major contributors in this process. Over time, these industries rapidly lost their competitiveness, and many women workers were forced out of their jobs. Subsequently, during the transition period they moved on to various occupations, especially in the low-productive informal sector. Their choices depended on three factors: (1) their own capability, (2) conditions and structures of households, and (3) occupational opportunity. The combination of these factors regulated their choices in different types of occupations. However, there are also socio-economic disparities within the informal sector workers, and it was observed that the strength to correspond and cope with changes and increased competition are not evenly distributed. © 2005, Sage India: New Delhi, India.

      "Abstract: Background: Utilities are critical inputs to economic analyses, yet some things remain unclear about their elicitation and application, particularly the impact of health status on values. Prospect theory predicts that current health affects values, and that losses loom larger than gains. If true, the use of utilities requires that additional complexities be considered. Objective: To determine the effect of current health on patient utilities for advanced cancer health states. Research Design: The research was a cross-sectional survey (n = 100 patients) of utilities for 4 hypothetical advanced cancer health states. Chained gamble utilities for gains and losses in health were compared, correlations between current health status and utilities were measured, and patient utilities for experienced versus hypothetical health states were compared. Results: In this sample, gains in health were valued equivalently to losses, health status was not correlated with utility values, and patients' valuation of states equivalent to their current health did not differ from valuations of the same states by patients with better or worse current health. Conclusion: This research confirms the uncertainty surrounding the effect of health status on utilities and the question of whose values to use in analyses. The findings suggest that values for health states may be independent of current health status, supporting an objective view of utilities. This research also suggests that patients may be able to provide \"experienced utilities\" for states other than their own, expanding the population from whom such values can be elicited. These results may dispute prospect theory's predictions regarding health state valuations.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It is disturbingly common for victims of peer victimization, also referred to as bullying, to withhold disclosure of their experience.This is so despite the implementation of numerous programs to increase the ability and willingness of victims to disclose and to improve the capacity of others to intervene. Disclosure is a complex matter that may not always result in desired outcomes. The authors use illustrations from their research to examine peer victimization disclosure by children and the factors that inhibit it. Secrecy, powerlessness, victim self-blaming, retaliation, child vulnerabilities, fear of losing the relationship if the bully is a friend, and expectations regarding the effectiveness of adult interventions all impede disclosure. Based on these factors, the authors make suggestions for general social work practice when working with children who have experienced victimization by their peers.

      "Abstract: Pathological gambling (PG) is most likely associated with functional brain changes as well as neuropsychological and personality alterations. Recent research with the Iowa Gambling Task suggests decision-making impairments in PG. These deficits are usually attributed to disturbances in feedback processing and associated functional alterations of the orbitofrontal cortex. However, previous studies with other clinical populations found relations between executive (dorsolateral prefrontal) functions and decision-making using a task with explicit rules for gains and losses, the Game of Dice Task. In the present study, we assessed 25 male PG patients and 25 male healthy controls with the Game of Dice Task. PG patients showed pronounced deficits in the Game of Dice Task, and the frequency of risky decisions was correlated with executive functions and feedback processing. Therefore, risky decisions of PG patients might be influenced by both dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex dysfunctions. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The \"framing effect\" is observed when the description of options in terms of gains (positive frame) rather than losses (negative frame) elicits systematically different choices. Few theories explain the framing effect by using cognitive information-processing principles. In this paper we present an explanatory theory based on the cost-benefit tradeoffs described in contingent behavior. This theory proposes that individuals examining various alternatives try to determine how to make a good decision while expending minimal cognitive effort. For this study, we used brain activation functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate individuals that we asked to choose between one certain alternative and one risky alternative in response to problems framed as gains or losses. Our results indicate that the cognitive effort required to select a sure gain was considerably lower than the cognitive effort required to choose a risky gain. Conversely, the cognitive effort expended in choosing a sure loss was equal to the cognitive effort expended in choosing a risky loss. fMRI revealed that the cognitive functions used by the decision makers in this study were localized in the prefrontal and parietal cortices of the brain, a finding that suggests the involvement of working memory and imagery in the selection process. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Such an empirical investigation has not yet been undertaken for the UK. Our results show that the stock market generally appeared to have anticipated the implementation of SSAP 20. For the aggregate set of adopters, we found a positive stock market response in the official year of adoption, reflecting the appreciation of the income-stabilising effects of the standard. This paper also presents a cross-sectional analysis that tests for a relationship between the stock returns and the accounting measures of those firms that adopted SSAP 20. We found a significant relation between the stock returns and the related accounting measures in the actual adoption period of the aggregate set of adopters.

      "Abstract: Streaks of past outcomes, for example of gains or losses in the stock market, are one source of information for a decision maker trying to predict the next outcome in the series. We examine how prediction biases based on streaks change as a function of length of the current streak. Participants experienced a sequence of 150 flips of a simulated coin. On the first of a streak of heads, participants showed positive recency, meaning that they predicted heads for the next outcome with a greater-than-baseline probability. As streak length increased, positive recency first decreased but then increased again, producing a quadratic trend. We explain these results in terms of outcome-prediction processes that are sensitive to the historical frequency of streak lengths and that make heuristic assumptions about changes in bias of the outcome-generating process (here, the coin). An ACT-R simulation captures the quadratic trend in positive recency, as well as the baseline heads bias, in two experimental conditions with different coin biases. We discuss our memory-based model in relation to a model from the domain of economics that posits explicit representation of an \"urn\" from which events are sampled without replacement. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract: Prior research suggests that bicultural individuals (i.e., individuals with 2 distinct sets of cultural values) shift the values they espouse depending on cues such as language. The authors examined whether the effects of language extend to a potentially less malleable domain, behavioral decisions, exploring the extent to which bilingual individuals shift the underlying strategies used to resolve choice problems. Although past research has explained language-induced shifts in terms of knowledge accessibility principles, the motivation to conform to observers' norms can also drive these shifts. This article focuses on shifts in the general strategy of avoiding losses rather than pursuing gains, which is more often exhibited by Chinese than by Westerners. Five studies of Hong Kong bicultural individuals found that language manipulation (Cantonese vs. English) increases tendencies to choose compromise options in a product decision task, endorse associated decision guidelines that advocate moderation as opposed to extreme paths, defer decision making in problems where it can be postponed, and endorse decision guidelines that advocate caution rather than decisive action. A motivational explanation of these effects was confirmed. Copyright © 2005, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: We evaluated the hypothesis that metformin would improve signs and symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in adolescents as compared to oral contraceptive pills (OCP) and have a favorable effect on obesity. Study Design: Thirty-five obese, post-menarchal, non-sexually active adolescents aged 12-21 years with PCOS and hyperinsulinism were randomly assigned to receive either OCP or metformin for 6 months. Results: There was a significant decrease in BMI in the two groups over time, from 40.1 to 38.6 in the OCP group, and 37.3 to 36.3 in the metformin group, p = 0.0026, but no significant difference in the degree of change between the two groups. Both groups had decreased free testosterone (OCP: 1.8 pg/ml to 0.96 pg/ml; metformin: 2.1 pg/ml to 1.6 pg/ml), p <0.0001, and improvements in insulin resistance as evidenced by increased glucose/insulin (G/I) ratio (p <0.005) and increased QUICK1 scores (p <0.0005). No significant differences in response to treatment were found between the metformin and OCP groups in outcome variables. Conclusion: Adolescents with PCOS treated with metformin or OCP experienced similar beneficial outcomes including reduction in androgen levels, weight loss, and increased insulin sensitivity.

We assumed that anticipated negative reactions to losses deter people from trading an endowed object and therefore psychological variables that attenuate the emotional response to negative events should further reduce the price disparity between buyers and sellers. In 3 studies, we tested whether factors that either decrease concern about negative feelings (e.g., positive mood, framing of the transaction as involving no action) or increase the anticipated negative reaction to failure to act (e.g., priming errors of omission) further eliminate the disparity between buying and selling prices. These studies provide a novel conceptualization of the endowment bias and, more generally, illustrate the role of anticipated negative feelings in decision making.

Many of the behavioural patterns that have been discovered do seem to be relevant to broader areas of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). In this paper, we look specifically at the judgemental inputs required in implementing goal programming (GP) models. The potential relevance of some of the known cognitive biases in this context are identified, and their impact studied by means of simulation experiments. It is found, inter alia, that biases due to anchoring and adjustment and to avoidance of sure loss can lead to substantial degradation in the performance of GP algorithms.

      "Abstract: Humiliation; incarceration; stigma; loss of income, freedom, and respect: most research on offending emphasizes these sanctions. Yet classical theorists recognized other costs including physical harm. We revive this abandoned insight, arguing that danger - the possibility of pain - figures largely in people's decisions to offend. Although modern states typically eschew violence, many victims, vigilantes, and others assault offenders. This violence is typically more certain, swift, and severe than other sanctions, and fear of injury likely deters many potential offenders. Yet the possibility of pain may be irrelevant to individuals who boldly believe in their unassailability. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that perceptions about danger are significantly associated with involvement in theft, drug selling, and prostitution among homeless youth, and that these effects are independent of perceptions about a crime's excitement, profit, or other returns. Our results suggest that dangers play a key but typically neglected role in the genesis of these crimes. © The University of North Carolina Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

An example of such a consideration is the dependence of outcome value on a reference point and the increased sensitivity of loss relative to gain (i.e., loss aversion). Loss aversion can explain the St. Petersburg paradox without requiring concave utility, it has the correct psychological foundation, it is theoretically useful, and it is a parsimonious principle that can explain many puzzles. A few open questions are whether loss aversion is a stable feature of preference, whether it is an expression of fear, and what are its properties.\u001b[0m :\n",

Terasaki, K. Shiomi, Y. Kishimoto, & K. Hiraoka, 1987) of the Sensation-Seeking Scale (M. Zuckerman, 1994). The results indicated that the certainty effect (Kahneman & Tversky) disappears in multistage gambling tasks and that differences in reflection-impulsivity and in gender influence the process of decision making under gain conditions. These results are discussed in terms of the decision strategies and cognitive biases involved in the multistage gambling task. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The fitness consequences of dispersal decisions are difficult to quantify, especially for long-lived species with complex social systems. To calculate those consequences for male mountain gorillas, from the perspective of both subordinate and dominant males, we used behavioral and demographic data obtained over 30 years from the Virunga Volcano population to develop an agent-based model that simulates the life history events, social structure, and population dynamics of the species. The model included variables for birth rates, mortality rates, dispersal patterns, and reproductive skew. The model predicted an average lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of 3.2 for philopatric males (followers) and 1.6 for emigrants. The benefits of philopatry were most sensitive to opportunities for social queuing and to female transfer preferences, but philopatry remained the best strategy over a wide range of group conditions and hypothetical simulations. The average LRS for dominant males was 4.5 when a subordinate stayed and 4.6 when the subordinate emigrated. The dispersal decision of the subordinate male had little impact on the fitness of the dominant male because it came relatively late in the dominant male's reproductive life span, and it changed his group composition only incrementally. The fitness consequences for the dominant male were most sensitive to the degree of reproductive skew. Since subordinates suffer a fitness loss when they leave a group, they should accept whatever reproductive restraint is needed to avoid eviction, and the dominant male does not need to offer concessions for them to stay. The dominant male may offer reproductive concessions for other reasons, such as peace incentives or to confuse paternity, or he may not have complete control of reproduction within his group. © Springer-Verlag 2005.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The management team of Memorial Medical Center must make a decision regarding the continuation of one of its outpatient clinics. To provide better community service, MMC developed three outpatient clinics throughout a large metropolitan area. Over the past several years, one of the clinics has consistently been a financial loser. The losses have grown even as the costs of maintaining the clinic have increased. A primary reason for the negative financial performance is the high amount of nonreimbursed healthcare services-the clinic provides needed healthcare to a low-income part of the metropolitan area. Several members of the executive management team believe MMC has no alternative other than closing the clinic. One member of the management team, however, believes that the situation raises ethical concerns, and that executive seeks an ethics-grounded response to the problem.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In absolute terms, young drivers have three to four times as many accidents per year as older drivers; and even allowing for their relative numbers in the population, their accident involvement is about 2.5 times higher than older drivers. A sample of 3437 accident reports was considered, including 1296 in detail, from midland police forces in the UK, involving drivers aged 17-25, and covering the years 1994-1996 inclusive. Four types of accident were identified as being of particular concern due to their high frequency: 'cross-flow'-turns; rear-end shunts; loss of control on bends; and accidents in darkness. (The term 'cross-flow' is used in relation to turns to denote an intersection accident where a driver is turning across the path of oncoming traffic, i.e., left turns in the US and continental Europe, but right turns in the UK and other countries where driving on the left side of the road is the norm.) An examination of driver risk taking behaviours as revealed in police interviews gave an insight into some of the motivational factors underlying young driver behaviour. Young driver accidents of all types are found to be frequently the result of 'risk taking' factors as opposed to 'skill deficit' factors. It had previously been thought that one of the main problems that young drivers have is in the area of specific skills needed in the driving task. However, it appears that a large percentage of their accidents are purely the result of two or three failures resulting from voluntary risk taking behaviour, rather than skill deficits per se. It is shown that specific groups of young drivers can even be considered as above average in driving skills, but simultaneously have a higher accident involvement due to their voluntary decisions to take risks. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract: The Swedish coastal zone is a scene of conflicting interests about various goods and services provided by nature. Open-access conditions and the public nature of many services increase the difficulty in resolving these conflicts. \"Sustainability\" is a vague but widely accepted guideline for finding reasonable trade-offs between different interests. The UN view of sustainable development suggests that coastal zone management should aim at a sustainable ecological, economic, and social-cultural development. Looking closer at economic sustainability, it is observed that economic analyses about whether changes in society imply a gain or a loss should take into account the economic value of the environment. Methods used for making such economic valuation in the context of the Swedish coastal zone are briefly reviewed. It is noted that the property rights context matters for the results of a valuation study. This general background is followed by a concise presentation of the design and results of four valuation studies on Swedish coastal zone issues. One study is on the economic value of an improved bathing water quality in the Stockholm archipelago. The other studies are a travel cost study about the economic value of improved recreational fisheries in the Stockholm archipelago, a replacement cost study on the value of restoring habitats for sea trout, and a choice experiment study on the economic value of improved water quality along the Swedish westcoast. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2005.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Imagine that you own a five-outcome gamble with the following payoffs and probabilities: ($100, .20; $50, .20; $0, .20; -$25, .20; -$50, .20). What happens when the opportunity to improve such a gamble is provided by a manipulation that adds value to one outcome versus another outcome, particularly when the opportunity to add value to one outcome versus another outcome changes the overall probability of a gain or the overall probability of a loss? Such a choice provides a simple test of the expected utility model (EU), original prospect theory (OPT), and cumulative prospect theory (CPT). A study of risky choices involving 375 respondents indicates that respondents were most sensitive to changes in outcome values that either increased the overall probability of a strict gain or decreased the overall probability of a strict loss. These results indicate more support for OPT rather than CPT and EU under various assumptions about the shape of the utility and value and weighting functions. Most importantly, the main difference between the various expectation models of risky choice occurs for outcomes near the reference value. A second study of risky choice involving 151 respondents again demonstrated the sensitivity of subjects to reducing the probability of a strict loss even at the cost of reduced expected value. Consequently, we argue that theories of how people choose among gambles that involve three or more consequences with both gains and losses need to include measures of the overall probabilities of a gain and of a loss. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

One hundred and five undergraduate business students made risk and preference judgments about lottery pairs in a series of paper surveys. The data indicate that the participants' responses were generally consistent with the key assumptions of risk-value models, but that some extensions of the theory would improve this consistency. In particular, we find that modifying the risk assumptions of the risk-value theory so they are consistent the concept of the reflection of the risk attitude in the domains of gains and losses increases the agreement between the theory and the participants' responses. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Like a typical developing country, Pakistan has been facing the challenge of losing Its human resources to the more prosperous and developed countries. A sizable number of the of country's highly qualified and experienced professionals immigrate to the so-called Western and Middle Eastern regions for a wide variety of reasons. At best, this phenomenon generates some financial resources in the form of remittances sent by these overseas Pakistanis. But at worst, it constantly impoverishes the various types of enterprises, services and sectors that develop and invest in these professionals in the form of subsidized training/education at different levels. Brain drain is also governed by a multitude of influences generated locally as well as globally. Comparative monetary benefits, quality of life, perceptions of better prospects for future generations, social freedom and liberal atmosphere are some parameters that are crucial in affecting the decision making at the individual level. Different stakeholders respond to brain drain in very different ways. The most peculiar is the official viewpoint, which favors the whole situation. The governments consider brain drain as an economically productive phenomenon. Remittances and direct transactions generated by the highly qualified human resources are taken as an achievement, instead of an impending predicament in the way of national development.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A new supply contract based on sharing the sales profits as well as the cost of effort was developed to coordinate the supply chain with sales effort effects. The contract coordinates the supplier's actions with voluntary compliance; the contract is symmetric in the sense that both the supplier's and retailer's profits are linearly correlated and is more easily implemented in some situations. The impact of the retailer's loss aversion on his effort is investigated based on the contract. After characterizing the retailer's optimal solutions, this paper demonstrates that contrary to intuition, loss aversion weakens incentives for retailer's sales effort and the retailer's optimal effort decreases as the loss aversion increases.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMF) damage can lead to impaired decision-making. This has been studied most intensively with the Iowa gambling task (IGT), a card game that asks subjects to overcome an initial attraction to high-payoff decks as losses begin to accrue. VMF subjects choose from the high risk decks more often than controls, but the fundamental impairments driving poor performance on this complex task have yet to be established. There is also conflicting evidence regarding the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLF) in this task. The present study examined whether poor performance on the IGT was specific for VMF damage and whether fundamental impairments in reversal learning contributed to IGT performance. We found that both VMF and DLF damage leads to impaired IGT performance. The impairment of VMF subjects, but not of DLF subjects, seems to be largely explained by an underlying reversal learning deficit.\u001b[0m :\n",

For loss averse decision makers, myopia causes the sequence to look less attractive and might result in rejecting an investment program that would have been accepted otherwise. In this paper, we argue that the relation between myopia and the attractiveness of a lottery sequence is less general than previously suggested in the literature. We extend the concept myopic loss aversion to myopic prospect theory , predicting that for specific risk profiles, myopia will not decrease but increase the attractiveness of a sequence.

      "Abstract: One of the most consistent findings in empirical studies using victimization data is that the decision to report victimization to the police is determined in large part by the seriousness of the crime. The police will be notified more often of crimes that involve more serious injury or greater monetary loss. These findings, however, may be due to the fact that most studies on reporting have been conducted using victimization surveys that devote a great deal of attention to the crime event and victim characteristics and much less to the social context of that event. As a result, influences on reporting operating at the neighborhood, jurisdiction, or nation level have been neglected. The aim of this paper is to bring social context into the discourse on reporting to the police by presenting a much more inclusive model of crime reporting. In addition, the influence of four aspects of macro-level social context on reporting are tested - the perceived competence of the police, institutionalization of insurance business, norm of conformity, and level of individualism - by merging incident-level data from the International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) for 16 Western industrialized countries with nation-level data from various sources. Hierarchical logistic modeling is used to analyze the nested data. The perceived competence of the police has a positive effect on whether property crimes are reported. © 2004 Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many practicing forecasters operate in an environment where there are either implicit or explicit biases favouring under- or over-forecasting. For example some marketing executives may be rewarded for exceeding the forecast which operates, in effect, as a sales target. In other organizations, the forecast may be set high to encourage greater effort. Previous studies show that most practical forecasts are indeed significantly biased, with some organizations biased one way and some the other. One of the possible reasons for this bias is the rational reaction to asymmetry in the loss function faced by the forecaster. This paper reports a laboratory study on the reactions of forecasters to different types of loss functions. The subjects were given a cover story that they were the production manager in an organization with an asymmetric loss function. This was diagrammatically displayed, and operationalised in the experiment by paying money bonuses to the subjects. Two shapes of loss function were used differing in their kindness, and two directions of bias, one favouring over- and one under-forecasting. The results show that the subjects responded appropriately to the differing directions of the asymmetry and to the differing kindness shapes of the loss functions. These results support the field research showing that forecast biases can be the result of deliberate and rational decision making behaviour on the part of the forecasters. © 2004 International Institute of Forecasters.

Such disclosure requirements however create a potential opportunity loss. They may destroy firms' opportunities for implementing an alternative information acquisition and exchange regime - one that would optimize the firms' product market profits. Nevertheless, we show that despite the previous imposition of an opportunity loss, firms may still favor future increased disclosure requirements. Finally, when information cost declines, although firms' welfare may decrease, their desire for increased disclosure requirements always strengthens. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract: This paper explores the applicability of game theory to the modelling of enterprise networks. Although these networks have traditionally been studied by the qualitative methods of industrial management, the utilisation of game theory seems to provide new tools and solution concepts for studying them. The paper reviews earlier game theoretic studies on inter-firm cooperation and presents a general stepwise pattern for game theoretic modelling of network economy. In addition, the paper constructs a game theoretic model for studying possibilities for creating innovative incentives in an enterprise network. Inter-firm cooperation is characterised by the interaction of several decision-makers where, on the one hand, the network companies seek joint gains by networking, but, on the other hand, individual companies have their own objectives which may be in partial conflict with those of other companies. Here, game theory provides tools for the formal analysis of situations where multiple decision-makers may have partially conflicting interests, but cooperation between them is allowed. The determination of innovation incentives in enterprise networks is studied through an application of game theoretic modelling. An example from the boat-building industry is presented to illustrate the relevance of innovation incentives in enterprise networks. Specifically, three different equilibrium concepts are applied to determine innovation incentives under different circumstances. The proposed model helps award innovations that improve the efficiency of the network. In addition, the efficiency-improving arrangements can be implemented so that none of the network companies has to suffer. Consequently, the enterprise network becomes innovative and the network companies need not fear their own losses when the efficiency-improving arrangements are implemented. The model also helps share the surplus utility gained through the innovation among the companies of the network. Copyright © VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland 2004.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Triggered by rather surprising findings that respondents in Asian cultures (e.g., Chinese) are more risk-seeking and more overconfident than respondents in other cultures (e.g., in United States) and that the reciprocal predictions are in total opposition, four experiments were designed to extend previous collective-culture oriented researches. Results revealed that (1) Singapore 21, which is a vision of Singapore in the 21st century and has highlighted the promotion of a collective culture, did not advocate greater risk-seeking but led to weaker overconfidence; (2) the knowledge of 'financial help from social network' did not permit prediction of risk preference but the knowledge of 'the value difference between possible outcomes' did; (3) the social network could be viewed not only as a positive 'cushion' but also as a negative 'burden' in both gain and loss domains of risky choices; (4) the predictions of the risk-as-value, risk-as-feelings and stereotype hypotheses were not consistent with the predicted risk preferences of others but the predictions of the economic-performance hypothesis were consistent with the predicted risk preferences as well as the predicted overconfidence of others. The implications for cross-cultural variations in overconfidence and for cross-cultural variations in risk-taking were discussed. © 2004 Brill Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, the market reacts more positively to downsizing actions when reallocation strategies are used and to large downsizing actions when disengagement incentives are applied.

This research demonstrates that preference for the status quo is a function of goal orientation and, in particular, that it tends to be more pronounced for prevention-focused than for promotion-focused consumers. The preference for the status quo was examined on two dimensions: preference for the status quo alternative and preference for inaction over action. In this context, it is shown that the impact of goal orientation on the preference for the status quo can occur independently of loss aversion - a finding consistent with the notion that goal orientation might impact choice by virtue of motivational factors such as self-regulation of anticipated regret.\u001b[0m :\n",

Study design: Narrative email survey of 70 bereaved parents with quantitative and qualitative analysis. Results: Bereaved parents of multiples find neonatal hospitalization stressful. Not all caregivers acknowledged loss, although most parents would welcome brief loss discussions during survivors' hospitalization. Half of respondents felt social workers could help coordinate support or mental health care. Most participants recalled hospital support for loss, but only 43% recalled support for neonatal hospitalization. Respondents praised peer support and written materials. Parents felt ambivalent about disposition for deceased babies while comultiples were ill; most made prompt arrangements. Attachment to survivors was difficult for half. Breastfeeding and discharge planning were important, and 31% had difficulty coping at home. Conclusions: Caregivers must communicate better with bereaved multiple-birth parents, whose desires for support, loss discussions, disposition, and discharge vary considerably. © 2004 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Consumers of software often face an acquisition-mode decision, namely whether to purchase or pirate that software. In terms of consumer welfare, consumers who pirate software may stand in opposition to those who purchase it. Marketers also face a decision whether to attempt to thwart that piracy or to ignore, if not encourage it as an aid to their software's diffusion, and policymakers face the decision whether to adopt interventionist policies, which are government-centric, or laissez faire policies, which are marketer-centric. Here in order to assess the decision-making of all three of these stakeholders, we focus on the consumer's point-of-view as central and examine it by considering on a comparative basis the ethical dimension versus other dimensions, including economic, legal, and other salient consumer behavior considerations. Based on a survey of 689 software consumers conducted over the Internet, the results indicate that ethics as a factor is embedded in a multidimensional set of determinant factors influencing software piracy, including attitudes, legal aspects, social support, perceptions of economic loss and age.

Five focus groups were conducted with subjects invited from the Geriatric Clinic of an urban tertiary care hospital. Thematic and latent content analyses were used. Five broad themes emerged as reasons behind the acceptance or rejection of a PEG tube, namely: the nature of the illness; the quality of life at the time of the decision; the concern about dependency; experiences; and religion (including issues of death). The issue of proxy also arose and contained three themes: fear of loss of decision-making ability; trust in family or caregivers as proxy even when the proxy choices differed from their own choices; and trust in the doctor and family to respect personal decisions. Use of a qualitative approach enabled potentially sensitive issues to be discussed. Preferences and the reasons behind these preferences may not always be anticipated by clinicians.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Conventional economic models of traffic congestion assume that the relation between traffic flow and speed is a technical one. This paper develops a behavioural model of traffic congestion, in which drivers optimize their speeds by trading off time costs, expected accident costs and fuel costs. Since the presence of other drivers affects the latter two cost components and hence the Nash equilibrium speed, a 'behavioural' speed-flow relationship results for which external congestion costs include expected accident costs and fuel costs, in addition to the time costs considered in the conventional model. It is demonstrated that the latter in fact even cancel in the calculation of optimal congestion tolls. The overall welfare optimum in our model is found to be off the speed-flow function, and off the average and marginal cost functions derived from it in the conventional approach. This full optimum requires tolls to be either accompanied by speed policies, or to be set as a function of speed. Using an empirically calibrated numerical simulation model, we illustrate these qualitative findings, and attempt to assess their potential empirical relevance. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

SUBJECTS: The study included 1289 subjects 18-75 y with a body mass index ≥ 30kg/m 2 and < 50kg/m2 in the absence of comorbidities, or ≥ 27kg/m2 and < 50kg/m2 in the presence of controlled hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia. DURATION: The original study design was for a 6-week, single-blind, placebo run-in phase followed by an 8-week titration phase and 2 y of maintenance at the assigned dose. Sponsor ended study early in order to develop a new controlled-release formulation with the potential to enhance tolerability and simplify dosing in this patient population. Therefore, none of the subjects completed the full 2 y of treatment. Efficacy results are based on subjects who were enrolled early enough to have had an opportunity to complete 1 y at their assigned dose (modified intent-to-treat population, MITT) before learning of the decision to terminate the study. Safety results are based on all subjects who took at least one dose of study medication. RESULTS: The safety population consisted of 1282 subjects, and the MITT efficacy population was 854 subjects. At 60 weeks, subjects in the placebo group lost 1.7% of their baseline body weight, while subjects in the topiramate 96, 192, and 256 mg/day treatment groups lost 7.0, 9.1, and 9.7%, respectively (P < 0.001, MITT, last observation carried forward). Weight loss ≥ 5% of baseline weight was achieved by 18% of subjects in the placebo arm vs 54, 61, and 67% of subjects receiving topiramate 96, 192, and 256 mg/day, respectively; weight loss ≥ 10% was achieved by 6 vs 29, 40, and 44%, respectively (P < 0.001). Weight loss was accompanied by significant improvements in blood pressure (systolic/diastolic changes of + 0.4/ + 1.0, -3.1/-1.3, -5.7/-3.4, and -4.6/-2.4 mmHg were observed for placebo, topiramate 96 mg/day, 192 mg/day, and 256 mg/day, respectively, P < 0.001) and glucose and insulin. The most common adverse events more frequently observed in topiramate-treated subjects occurred mostly during the titration phase and were related to the central or peripheral nervous system and included paresthesia, difficulty with concentration/attention, depression, difficulty with memory, language problems, nervousness, and psychomotor slowing. CONCLUSION: Topiramate treatment of obese subjects over the course of 1 y resulted in clinically significant weight loss. Improvements were also observed in blood pressure and glucose tolerance.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study attempts to compare levels of depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation among elderly males and females, in reference to their living arrangement, i.e., community vs. nursing homes. For many elderly people, old age is characterized by various losses: physiological, functional, social, cognitive, financial, etc. The outcomes of such losses often include, more often than not, environmental isolation, a subjective feeling of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and frequently, loss of motivation to continue living. In light of the rise in life expectancy and the multitude of losses which can be associated with the aging process, it is probable that one out of five elderly persons will spend part of his/her life in a long term care institute. Such living arrangements may have negative effects on the mental health of its residents, because placement is often accompanied by feelings of lack of control over one's own life, and inability to make decisions regarding daily issues. Elderly persons living in the community (227: 78 men, 149 women) and 91 living in nursing homes (33 men, 58 women), in both independent and frail functional status (ADL), participated in the study. Findings show significantly more hopelessness, helplessness, and depression among residents of nursing homes compared to those living in the community, differences between men and women living in both environments, and a correlation between other demographic variables and the three dependent variables of the study. The conclusions of the study indicate a need to pay interdisciplinary attention to the mental health of elderly residents of nursing homes, particularly in the preliminary stages of placement and adjustment. © 2004 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

      "Abstract: Rationale: Chronic marijuana use has been associated with impairments of learning, memory, and executive functions. Little is known, however, about the effects of marijuana use on other cognitive domains, such as decision-making, which are thought to play an important role in addiction and drug abuse. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to determine if long-term heavy marijuana users employ different decision-making strategies than individuals with minimal marijuana exposure. Methods: Volunteers were assigned to a cannabis (n = 10) or control group (n = 10) based upon history of prior marijuana use. Demographic and neuropsychological variables were evaluated, and a decision-making task - the gambling task (GT) was administered. Results: Although few demographic and neuropsychological differences were noted between groups, marijuana users made more decisions that led to larger immediate gains despite more costly losses than controls. Conclusions: These data suggest that long-term heavy marijuana users may have specific deficits in the ability to balance rewards and punishments that may contribute to continued drug-taking behavior. It is unknown, however, whether the basis for such deficits might be attributed directly to marijuana exposure or pre-existing genetic or behavioral differences. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

      "Abstract: Background. Researchers have found that African-American women have concerns about their weight, but are less successful in their weight loss efforts compared to Caucasian women. Reasons for this disparity have not been explored in great detail. Identifying specific attitudes and behaviors that contribute to obesity in these subpopulations will help inform the design of interventions. Methods. This report compares specific attitudes and behaviors related to diet and exercise in two groups who are trying to lose weight: African-American women in Indianapolis (n = 80) and Caucasian women from the rural Midwest (n = 45). Data are from surveys that shared many common measures, but were otherwise not related to one another. The choice of measures was guided by a conceptual framework of self-management processes. Results. Compared to women in the urban study, women in the rural study report greater social support for behavior change, greater self-efficacy, and outcome expectations, and greater use of every strategy measured. Conclusions. While there is room for improvement in both groups, these results contribute to our understanding of subgroup differences and similarities in the complex behavioral issues surrounding successful weight management. Larger studies with more representative samples are needed to confirm these findings and inform future interventions. © 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract: Background: Recent research indicates that currently active or recently detoxified substance abusers make more disadvantageous decisions on a simulated gambling task (SGT). This study expands on the current literature by using the SGT to examine decision making in long-term abstinent alcoholics (mean of 6.6 years' abstinence) who do not have antisocial personality disorder or a history of conduct disorder. Methods: A total of 102 subjects (58 controls and 44 abstinent alcoholics) were tested on the SGT, in which subjects choose cards from 4 different decks that vary in terms of the magnitude of the immediate win (large or small) and the magnitude of long-term loss (large or small). The association of SGT performance with alcohol use variables, with the number of externalizing symptoms, and with personality measures of social deviance was examined. Results: Compared with controls, long-term abstinent alcohol-dependent subjects had more externalizing symptoms, had personality profiles associated with a proneness to social deviance, and made more disadvantageous decisions on the SGT. The magnitude of disadvantageous decision making was associated with the duration of peak alcohol use but was associated with only one measure (low socialization) of socially deviant personality traits. Conclusions: The results suggest that alcoholics can achieve long-term abstinence despite persistent deficits in decision making and abnormal personality profiles. The decision-making deficits either may be the result of long-term alcoholism or may reflect a factor predisposing to alcoholism that persists with abstinence. The possibility is raised that alcoholics who cannot achieve long-term abstinence are even more impaired on their decision making and have more abnormal personality profiles than the abstinent alcoholics studied here.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: For Caribbean women who leave their children behind to migrate to the United States, the decision-making process is filled with pain and fraught with ambivalence. In response to open-ended questions about their migratory journey, immigrant women who migrated to New York City describe the process-from initial thoughts about leaving their home country, through the actual move, to their early days in the United States. This case study examines the painful and difficult experiences of undocumented women as they balance feelings of freedom and exhilaration with the challenges of economic survival, leaving their loved ones behind, parenting children from a distance, loneliness, and adjusting to a new environment while supporting themselves and family members at home. This exploratory study identifies the significant milestones in Caribbean women's migratory journey-points at which they access internal and external resources. Practitioners will understand the process, and resources these women call upon. Both the process and the accompanying resources are vital to future work with immigrant women and their families, as well as those women considering migrating and leaving their children behind. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The economic success of preventive health programs is typically assessed by the net health-related utility gain or loss to society relative to the cost. Issues relating to the positive or negative utility associated with participating in a preventive health program are often ignored. However, it is likely that calls for informed consumer choice and respect for patient autonomy will provide an impetus to examine utility associated with the process and outcomes of preventive health programs. In this paper, we outline the nature of the ex ante and ex post perspective in evaluing benefits and the presence of process utility and the utility of gambling in individual's utility function for preventive health care. The implications of including process attributes and psychological states when assessing benefits to society are discussed in relation to an empirical study on the value of external hip protectors for the prevention of hip fractures. We demonstrate that wearing hip protectors and the psychological outcomes of being a participant in the program can have a significant impact on individual's assessment of the benefits. Furthermore, point of reference plays a crucial role in their valuation. Individuals who did not consent to participate in a trial of hip protectors valued all states significantly lower than those who did participate in the trial. We argue that the utility associated with adherence to the intervention is an important issue for preventive health policy. From the viewpoint of applied welfare economics, evaluation of preventive health programs should allow for both process and outcome utility when assessing benefits. In this context, success might be viewed as maximising the opportunity for individuals to make an informed choice. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Conditions are derived for which the expected value of perfect information increases when mean and standard deviation are both linear functions of an exogenous variable.

      "Abstract: In a two-player proactive response game the level of proactive activity and the choice of terrorist target is endogenized. The targeted government first chooses its measures to weaken the terrorists, and the terrorists then choose the type of event - normal or spectacular. Unlike previous analyses, proactive policy has a downside by increasing grievances and, consequently, terrorist recruitment. If the government responds too harshly, its actions can empower the terrorists by providing a larger constituency. Aggressive antiterrorist actions, encouraged by a high perceived loss from terrorism and low marginal proactive costs, may result in spectacular events with dire consequences. If spectaculars are transferred abroad to soft targets, then proactive operations may be excessive from a global viewpoint as external costs are ignored. The analysis explains why some target nations engage in a modest level of offense but a prime target chooses a large level. © 2004 Sage Publications.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The purpose of this study was to compare the prevalence rate estimates and congruence in classification status derived from two popular measures of adolescent gambling (SOGS-RA and MAGS-7). Adolescents from three states (Alabama, Mississippi, and Oregon) completed an anonymous questionnaire (n=1846 high school students total). Results indicate that the prevalence of probable adolescent pathological gambling varied both as a function of instrument and cut-off point utilized for classification (range 1.7%-8.2%). Classification groups (non-problem, at-risk, and problem gamblers) generated by both instruments were found to be associated with reports of gambling frequency, amount of money lost in one gambling occasion, and parental gambling problems. However, concern was raised because the MAGS-7 and the SOGS-RA had little congruence in their three-group classification decisions for specific individuals (e.g., only 20.5% agreement for problem gamblers). To improve clinical utility, an empirical case was made for using the SOGS-RA to generate a fourth group of adolescent gamblers, which we labeled \"probable pathological gamblers\" (SOGS-RA ≥ 6). This group was differentiated from the remaining gambling groups on all the validity indices. The implications and limitations of these findings, as well as future directions, are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

We find that it is often optimal to underinvest in the arbitrage by taking a smaller position than collateral constraints allow. Even when the optimal policy is followed, the arbitrage portfolio typically experiences losses before the final convergence date. In fact, its initial performance may be indistinguishable from that of a conventional portfolio with a poor track record.

      "Abstract: The optimal design of offshore structures is formulated as a decision theoretical problem. The objective is to maximize the expected net present value of the life cycle benefit. The general optimization problem is simplified by taking into account the cost impacts of a possible reconstruction of the structure. The analytical solution to this problem has been derived for the case, where failure events follow a stationary Poisson process. The life cycle benefit is formulated in terms of the production profile, the design and construction costs, failure costs and reconstruction costs. In order to assess the effect of potential loss of lives, the costs of fatalities are included applying the concept of the Implied Costs of Averting a Fatality (ICAF). The suggested approach to optimal design, which can be applied for any type of offshore structure, is exemplified considering the special case of steel structures. Here, it is standard to represent the ultimate structural capacity in terms of the Reserve Strength Ratio (RSR). For the purpose of illustration, the relation between material usage and RSR, which is valid for monopod structures, is applied. Optimal RSR's and corresponding annual failure rates are assessed for both manned and unmanned structures covering a wide range of different realistic ratios between the potential revenues and costs for construction, failure and reconstruction. © 2004 by ASME.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The standard gamble (SG) method and the time tradeoff (TTO) method are commonly used to measure utilities. However, they are distorted by biases due to loss aversion, scale compatibility, utility curvature for life duration, and probability weighting. This article applies corrections for these biases and provides new data on these biases and their corrections. The SG and TTO utilities of 6 rheumatoid arthritis health states were assessed for 45 healthy respondents. Various corrections of utilities were considered. The uncorrected TTO scores and the corrected (for utility curvature) TTO scores provided similar results. This article provides arguments suggesting that the TTO scores are biased upward rather than having balanced biases. The only downward bias in TTO scores was small and probably cannot offset the upward biases. The TTO scores are higher than the theoretically most preferred correction of the SG, the mixed correction. These findings suggest that uncorrected SG scores, which are higher than TTO scores, are too high.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this paper is to understand why some men decide to have a testicular prosthesis while others reject the idea and to explore the extent to which the option of a testicular prosthesis is adequately presented. Forty-five men with testicular cancer were interviewed about all aspects of their illness. Some men decided against a prosthesis for a number of reasons; they thought that the loss of a testicle was not visibly obvious, did not affect self-image, was not a long-term threat to masculinity, and that living with one testicle was comfortable. Some did not want additional surgery and others were concerned about safety issues. The men who decided to have a prosthesis were concerned about self-image and a threat to masculinity. They had a desire to look 'normal' and a wish to keep the orchidectomy secret. Some men felt that the decision had been rushed. Others wished that they had had information about the possibility of implants before the orchidectomy or they considered the information presented inadequate. We conclude that it is important to counsel men with testicular cancer about the advantages and disadvantages of having a testicular prosthesis and to give them time to consider issues such as cosmetic appearance, self-image, comfort, possible short term complications and long-term safety.

      "Abstract: A recent study has reported the observation in humans of an event-related brain potential component that is sensitive to the value of outcomes in a gambling task. This component, labeled medial frontal negativity (MFN), was most pronounced following monetary losses as opposed to monetary gains. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the MFN and the error-related negativity (ERN), a component elicited by feedback indicating incorrect choice performance. We argue that the two components can be understood in terms of a recently proposed theory that predicts the occurrence of such scalp negativities following stimuli that indicate that ongoing events are worse than expected. The results from two experiments using a gambling task demonstrate that the sensitivity of the MFN/ERN to the utilitarian and performance aspect of the feedback depends on which aspect is most salient. The results are consistent with the view that the two components are manifestations of the same underlying cognitive and neural process.\u001b[0m :\n",

These models fail to generate unstable decision dynamics, a phenomenon that can be observed in collective decision-making. To capture instability, we assume that decision-makers raise their level of salience to reduce expected losses from decision-outcomes. Our model generates persistently unstable outcome patterns under conditions related to the social network and to intolerance for expected losses, A 6-actor example reveals stable out-comes for low intolerance, complex oscillations for intermediate levels of intolerance, and simple and regular oscillation for high intolerance. We discuss implications for the predictability of collective decision-making.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The current study examined the pattern of heart rate and skin conductance changes preceding risky choices and following outcome for bad, moderate, and good performers on an analogue of the Iowa gambling task (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994). The task required a choice between four options; two options were followed by a high reward and, unpredictably, an even higher loss (disadvantageous options) and two other options were followed by a small reward but the unpredictable loss was also small (advantageous options). Anticipatory heart rate slowing and skin conductance level were higher preceding disadvantageous relative to advantageous options, but only for good performers. In contrast, heart rate slowed and skin conductance level increased following loss relative to reward outcomes, and these changes were similar for all performance groups. These findings were interpreted to suggest that decision-making impairments in bad performers arise from a weak somatic response generated by secondary inducers (i.e., somatic markers), rather than a weak somatic response generated by primary inducers of reward and punishment.\u001b[0m :\n",

With evidence of increased safety and more women (many aged 40 years or more) asking for counseling about reduction to a singleton, we reviewed our prior reasoning. METHODS: We compared outcomes of 52 first-trimester twin-to-singleton for multifetal pregnancy reduction cases performed by a single operator to twin and singleton data from recent national register studies. RESULTS: Twin-to-singleton reductions represent less than 3% of all cases. Forty of 52 patients were aged 35 years or more, 19 were aged more than 40 years, and 2 were aged more than 50 years (age range 32-54years). Since 1999, 23 of 28 had chorionic villus sampling before multifetal pregnancy reduction. Fifty-one of 52 reached viability with mean gestational age at delivery of 37.2 weeks. One of 52 patients miscarried (1.9°). Compared with multiple sources of data for twins, the loss rate is lower in twins reduced to a singleton. CONCLUSION: Until recently, multifetal pregnancy reductions to a singleton were rare. Physicians were concerned about the unknown risks of multifetal pregnancy reduction in this situation. They also had moral doubts about the justification to go \"below twins.\" However, physicians know that spontaneous twin pregnancy losses average 8-10%. Also, with experience, multifetal pregnancy reduction has become very safe in our hands. Our data suggest that the likelihood of taking home a baby is higher after reduction than remaining with twins. We propose that twin-to-singleton reductions might be considered with appropriate constraints and safeguards. © 2004 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present study examines the combination of economic theory, structure of the econometric model, and estimation techniques to extract the maximum possible information about the behavior of economic agents from observed decisions. The analysis is set in the framework of micro economic behavior and industrial organization. The relevant theoretical structures generally assume optimization behavior of economic agents. However, optimization models do not have a unique structure and are generally difficult to identify. Consequently, a variety of second best specification and estimation methods emerged. But they entail loss of information. Hence, greater efforts devoted to the identification of optimization models will enrich our understanding of economic behavior. Progress in this direction will eventually render a vast majority of existing econometric techniques obsolete. © 2004, The Indian Econometric Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

The economic losses are chosen as the optimization index. As an illustration of the proposed approach, three scenarios of possible accidents and a limited number of measures to lessen their consequences are examined.

      "Abstract: It has been suggested that inhibitory executive control of behavior is directed by the frontal lobes. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain regions that are involved in the inhibition of habitual manual responses. Fifteen right-handed subjects performed the rock-scissors-paper game against computer-simulated pictures of hands during the scanning procedure. The subjects were required to win, lose, or draw against the presented picture in a separate block. We considered that the situation in which subjects intentionally lost the game required the suppression of habitual behavior, because it is natural behavior for people to attempt to win the game. Compared with the WIN and DRAW conditions, the left premotor and sensorimotor areas were activated for both hand sessions with a positive correlation with error rates. Importantly, the LOSE condition in the case of the right hand yielded brain activation exclusively in the anterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus, the activity which showed a negative correlation with error rates. Overall brain activations were predominant in the left hemisphere, irrespective of the hand used for the response. The results suggest that the anterior part of the left inferior frontal gyrus plays a critical role in the inhibition of habitual manual behavior, and that the left hemisphere is dominant for the selection of well-learned manual behavior.\u001b[0m :\n",

Consistent with this hypothesis, we show that (a) investors are differentially sensitive to gains and losses and differentially risk seeking depending on the financial products being considered and (b) that these phenomena occur because of strong associations between financial products and promotion versus prevention. Therefore, investors' goals may be determined by the investment opportunities under evaluation rather than being independent of these opportunities, as is assumed in standard finance theory.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Traditional sensitivity analysis in linear programming usually focuses on variations of one coefficient or term at a time. The tolerance approach was proposed to provide a decision maker with an effective and easy-to-use method to summarize the effects of simultaneous and independent changes in selected parameters. In particular, for variations of the objective function coefficients, the approach gives a maximum-tolerance percentage within which selected coefficients may vary from their estimated values (within a priori limits) while still retaining the same optimal basic feasible solution. Although an optimal solution may cease being optimal for variations beyond the maximum-tolerance percentage, it may still be close to optimal. Herein we characterize the potential loss of optimality for variations beyond the maximum-tolerance percentage as a maximum-regret function. We consider theoretical properties of this function and propose a method to compute a relevant portion of it.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A study was undertaken to describe the treatment preferences and choices of patients with breast cancer, and to identify predictors of undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) or mastectomy (MT). Consecutive patients with stage I/II breast cancer were eligible. Information about predictor variables, including socio-demographics, quality of life, patients' concerns, decision style, decisional conflict and perceived preference of the surgeon was collected at baseline, before decision making and surgery. Patients received standard information (n = 88) or a decision aid (n = 92) as a supplement to support decision making. A total of 180 patients participated in the study. In all, 72% decided to have BCT (n = 123); 28% chose MT (n = 49). Multivariate analysis showed that what patients perceived to be their surgeons' preference and the patients' concerns regarding breast loss and local tumour recurrence were the strongest predictors of treatment preference. Treatment preferences in itself were highly predictive of the treatment decision. The decision aid did not influence treatment choice. The results of this study demonstrate that patients' concerns and their perceptions of the treatment preferences of the physicians are important factors in patients' decision making. Adequate information and communication are essential to base treatment decisions on realistic concerns, and the treatment preferences of patients. © 2004 Cancer Research UK.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Patients with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, when performing gambling tasks modeling real-life decision-making, opt for choices that yield high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. Under the hypothesis that the prefrontal cortex is the last brain region to mature, it was examined whether young children would show a similar preference for immediate prospects. In Experiment 1, 4 age groups (6-9, 10-12, 13-15 and 18-25 years olds) performed 2 versions of a computerized variant of the original Iowa gambling task under 3 different feedback conditions (no feedback, global feedback, and option-specific feedback) and completed the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices as an index of inductive reasoning ability. In Experiment 2, 3 age groups (7-8, 11-12, and 15-16 year olds) performed both task versions in addition to a working memory task ('Digit Span Backwards'). Results showed a developmental increase in the sensitivity to future consequences, positive or negative, that could not be explained by developmental changes in working memory capacity or inductive reasoning.

      "Abstract: Previous research has shown that two components of the event-related brain potential, the P300 and feedback negativity, are sensitive to information about rewards and penalties. The present study investigated the properties of these components in a simple gambling game that required participants to choose between cards that were unpredictably associated with monetary gains and losses of variable magnitude. The aim was to determine the sensitivity of each component to two critical features of reward stimuli: magnitude (small or large) and valence (win or loss). A double dissociation was observed, with the P300 sensitive to reward magnitude but insensitive to reward valence and the feedback negativity showing the opposite pattern, suggesting that these two fundamental features of rewarding stimuli are evaluated rapidly and separately in the human brain. Subsequent analyses provided additional evidence of functional dissociations between the feedback negativity and P300. First, the P300 (but not the feedback negativity) showed sensitivity to the reward value of alternative, nonselected stimuli. Second, individual differences in the amplitude of the feedback negativity correlated with individual differences in risk-taking behavior observed after monetary losses, whereas individual differences in P300 amplitude were related to behavioral adjustments observed in response to alternative, unchosen outcomes.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study examined the contribution of cognitive and emotion-based factors in predicting school-age children's risk-taking decisions when the social-situational context did, and did not, pressure for risk-taking. Using drawings of play situations that depicted three possible paths of travel that varied in injury risk and pitted convenience (length of path) against level of risk (e.g., shortest path was most risky), we explored children's appraisals of danger and injury severity (i.e., cognitive measures) and anticipated fear and excitement (i.e., emotion measures) for each possible path of travel. Children also indicated which path they would take and gave a justification for this decision. Subsequently, they were informed of information that threatened loss of a desired goal unless one of the more convenient (faster), risky paths was selected. Children then repeated their path selections and the cognitive and emotion appraisals. When the situation pressured for greater risk-taking to attain a desired goal, children endorsed greater risk-taking the majority of the time, with convenience being the most frequently cited reason for this decision. Regression analyses indicated that both cognitive and emotion-based measures contributed to predict risk-taking decisions in both social-situational contexts. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Three experiments with undergraduate samples were conducted in an effort to clarify the advantages and limitations of prospect theory as adapted to explain political behavior. The first experiment tested hypotheses regarding the impact of prospect framing on group polarization, but these were only weakly supported. The second and third experiments examined alternative adaptations of the concept of framing; the results suggest that the political science expansion of the concept of framing may, under certain conditions, produce clear and robust preference reversals.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decision making behaviour has often been shown to vary following changes in the way in which choice problems are described (or 'framed'). Moreover, a number of researchers have demonstrated that the standard gamble is prone to internal inconsistency, and loss aversion has been proposed as an explanation for this observed bias. This study attempts to alter the influence of loss aversion by framing the treatment arm of the standard gamble in terms of success (where we may expect the influence of loss aversion to be relatively weak) and in terms of failure (where we may expect the influence of loss aversion to be relatively strong). The objectives of the study are (1) to test whether standard gamble values vary when structurally identical gambles are differentially framed, and (2) to test whether the standard gamble is equally prone to internal inconsistency across the two frames. The results show that compared to framing in terms of treatment success, significantly higher values were inferred when the gamble was framed in terms of treatment failure. However, there was no difference in the quite marked levels of internal inconsistency observed in both frames. It is possible that the essential construct of the standard gamble induces substantial and/or widespread loss aversion irrespective of the way in which the gamble is framed, which offers a fundamental challenge to the usefulness of this value elicitation instrument. It is therefore recommended that further tests are undertaken on more sophisticated corrective procedures designed to limit the influence of loss aversion. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

But research suggests that people are remarkably good at avoiding self-blame, and hence they may be better at avoiding regret than they realize. Four studies measured people's anticipations and experiences of regret and self-blame. In Study 1, students overestimated how much more regret they would feel when they \"nearly won\" than when they \"clearly lost\" a contest. In Studies 2, 3a, and 36, subway riders overestimated how much more regret and self-blame they would feel if they \"nearly caught\" their trains than if they \"clearly missed\" their trains. These results suggest that people are less susceptible to regret than they imagine, and that decision makers who pay to avoid future regrets may be buying emotional insurance that they do not actually need.\u001b[0m :\n",

The researchers adapted questionnaires employed in studies with ordinary citizen jurors to look at the magistrates judges' decision-making process and discover if common errors (cognitive illusions) undermine their decisions. To test the magistrate's inclination to base their decisions on anchoring, some of the magistrates were given a case scenario in which a hypothetical plaintiff suffered serious, permanent injuries requiring long-term hospitalization, and a significant loss of wages. The judges in this group were not given an anchor. In a second version, additional information was introduced on the hypothetical scenario. The second panel was told the defendant asked the court to dismiss the case on the grounds that the value of the case did not meet the federal courts' US$75,000 jurisdictional threshold for cases like this.

Current data confirm previous evidence of convex utility functions and inverse-S-shaped weighting functions.

      "Abstract: Rationale: Converging evidence from studies with neurological patients and brain imaging studies with healthy volunteers suggests that the capacity to make choices between actions associated with probabilistic rewards and punishments depends upon a network of cortico-limbic systems including the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala and striatum. The involvement of such structures highlights the emotional aspects of decision-making and suggests that decision-making may be sensitive to manipulations of the catecholamine systems that innervate these structures. In this study, we investigated the possible role of noradrenaline (NA). Objective: We examined the effects of a single oral 80 mg dose of the beta-adrenoceptor blocker, propranolol, on the decision-making of healthy volunteers in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, between-subjects design. Methods: Seventeen volunteers ingested a placebo while 15 volunteers ingested propranolol. Visual analogue scales, and self-reported positive and negative ratings, were used to assess subjective changes and mood. Vital signs were also monitored. Seventy-five minutes after treatment, volunteers were asked to make a series of choices between two simultaneously presented gambles, differing in the magnitude of possible gains (i.e. reward), the magnitude of possible losses (i.e. punishment), and the probabilities with which these outcomes were delivered. Volunteers also chose between gambles probing identified non-cognitive biases in human decision-making, namely, risk-aversion when choosing between gains and risk-seeking when choosing between losses. Results: Propranolol treatment did not result in gross changes in subjective state or mood in comparison to placebo, but did slow heart rate significantly. Propranolol produced a selective change in volunteers' decision-making; namely, it significantly reduced the discrimination between large and small possible losses when the probability of winning was relatively low and the probability of losing was high. Conclusions: These results suggest that NA modulates the processing of punishment signals when choosing between probabilistic rewards and punishments under conditions of increased arousal.\u001b[0m :\n",

A questionnaire was sent to all 1438 consultants over this age in the UK. Results. A total of 848 questionnaires were returned, an adjusted response rate of 59%. The mean age at which consultants intended to retire in this sample was 60 years (s.d. 4.16), suggesting a potential loss of 5725 consultant years. Reasons for early retirement are complex: factors encouraging retirement include too much bureaucracy, lack of free time and heavy case-loads; those discouraging retirement include enjoyment of work, having a good team and money. Mental Health Officer status is an important determinant in the decision to retire early. Clinical Implications. With numerous vacancies in consultant psychiatrist posts throughout the UK, premature retirement is a cause for concern, possibly contributing to an overall reduction in consultant numbers of 5%. Addressing factors that influence consultants' decisions to leave the health service early should form an important part of an overall strategy to increase consultant numbers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Long-term employment contracts have typically been modeled as mechanisms whereby workers reduce the risk of lost income with a guaranteed long-term wage that is less than the expected spot wage. Examination of contract length among major league baseball players shows that long-term contracts for marginal players, those for whom it would seem most logical to desire this insurance, are rarely observed. Star players, whose income levels should enable them to purchase this sort of insurance from other sources, represent the majority of long-term contract holders. This paper presents a theoretical model showing that firms, when facing both market uncertainty and uncertainty about an employee's future productivity, have an incentive to reallocate risk with long-term labor contracts. In such cases, a long-term contract may be observed without a risk premium paid by the worker. The labor markets of professional sports represent this combination of market and productive uncertainty. Empirical results from major league baseball using a binary choice probit model, which corrects for sample selection bias, support the hypothesis that factors, which increase market uncertainty and reduce productive uncertainty, are consistent with the observation of long-term contracts.

      "Abstract: Background: dignity is a complex concept and there is little empirical research to show how older people view dignity. This study, using qualitative methods, explored the concept of dignity from the older person's perspective. Methods: 15 focus groups and two individual interviews were conducted in 12 different settings, with a total of 72 participants. Participants were purposively sampled to ensure a mix of socio-economic status, ethnicity, gender, age (65+) and level of fitness. Focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed. The method of constant comparison was used to analyse the data. Results: there was strong evidence to suggest that dignity was salient to the concerns of older people. Dignity was seen as a multi-faceted concept: (i) dignity of identity (self-respect/esteem, integrity, trust); (ii) human rights (equality, choice); and (iii) autonomy (independence, control). Examples of dignity being jeopardised rather than being enhanced were given. A loss of self-esteem arose from being patronised, excluded from decision-making, and being treated as an 'object'. Lack of integrity in society meant that there was an inability to trust others and an increased vulnerability. Equality was an important issue but many felt that government policies did not support their rights. Conclusions: this work identifies the different ways dignity is conceptualised by older people. The evidence showed that person centred care for older people needs to be specifically related to communication, privacy, personal identity and feelings of vulnerability. It provides evidence for policy makers and professionals to tailor policies and practices to the needs of the older person. © British Geriatrics Society 2004; all rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Results In the decision phase, choices involving large gains were associated with increased BOLD responses in the pregenual ACC, paracingulate, and right posterior orbitolateral cortex compared with choices involving small gains. In the outcome phase, good outcomes were associated with increased BOLD responses in the posterior orbitomedial cortex, subcallosal ACC, and ventral striatum compared with negative outcomes. There was only limited overlap between reward-related activity in ACC and orbitofrontal cortex during the decision and outcome phases. Conclusions Neural activity within the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortex, pregenual ACC, and striatum mediate distinct representations of reward-related information that are deployed at different stages during a decision-making episode.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the interference between postural control and cognitive processing in patients with surgically confirmed unilateral vestibular lesions. These patients were well-compensated for vestibular lesions with no symptoms of dizziness or definable postural deficit. We hypothesized that attentional processes would play a greater role in postural control of these patients compared to healthy age-matched controls suggesting that successful compensation for a vestibular impairment involves ongoing increased attentional resources, and is not an automatic process. To explore this hypothesis, we used a dual-task paradigm that combined postural challenges with concurrently performed cognitive tasks. The postural conditions were seated, standing on a fixed floor, standing on a sway-referenced floor, and standing on a translating floor. Cognitive tasks were simple, inhibitory, and forced choice reaction time (RT) tasks. Patients had slower RTs compared to the controls under all conditions, including the seated condition. This effect was particularly large for the choice and inhibitory tasks. Both groups had increased RTs as the postural task became more challenging. Postural sway increased similarly in the patients and controls when performing the RT tasks for all postural conditions. These results suggest that patients with vestibular lesions that are well-compensated require increased attention compared to healthy controls; however, this increased demand on attention extends beyond postural control. The site of action may be at the sensory integration level resolving multiple sensory signals for spatial orientation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The death of a child with a disability presents unique challenges for individual family members. Whereas parents have received much attention in terms of their needs and challenges, siblings have received less attention. Growing up with a child with a disability who subsequently dies has a profound impact. This paper used in-depth interviews to illuminate the experiences and perceptions of siblings in one family in which a child with cerebral palsy died. The 5 siblings were interviewed about their experiences of family life and their methods of coping during the terminal phases of illness and after their sister's death. Their views on friendships, growing up, vocational choices, their sister's contribution to their lives, and their adjustment to her death are illustrated. Implications for health professionals working with siblings and families are drawn in terms of adult siblings' coping responses and their need for mutual support.\u001b[0m :\n",

The second aim of the study was to examine prospect theory propositions that people are risk aversive for gains and risk seeking for losses. A total of 220 students were administered scenarios that described outcomes of their stock investments (gains or losses). In addition, they were provided with information about their close friends' outcomes investing in similar stocks. Generally, the hypothesis regarding the influence of others' outcomes on framing was confirmed. However, results showed that, in contradiction to prospect theory, gain framing rather than loss framing was related to risk seeking behavior. Specifically, in the gain framing situation, the readiness to take risks was highest when the others' outcomes were equal to those of the participants.

      "Abstract: We examined the possible role of autonomic activity in Huntington's disease (HD) during a risky decision making task. Skin conductance responses (SCRs) of 15 HD participants and 16 healthy controls were measured while they performed a computerized version of the Simulated Gambling Task (SGT). The results replicated our previous finding of a performance decrement in HD, and showed that HD was associated with an altered pattern of SCRs during the risky decision task. Specifically, the healthy controls produced increased SCRs following selections from the disadvantageous decks and following losing selections. In contrast, the SCRs of the HD group did not differentiate between wins and losses. These findings indicate a reduced impact of loss on decision-making processes under risky conditions in HD.

We consider a (boundedly rational) decision maker who does not find her new optimal consumption bundle with certainty when she is faced with a new income level.

The paper provides evidence that the implementation of SSAP No. 20 has improved the financial accounting measures of firms, such as profitability and leverage. The effects of the standard tended to be more substantial for adopters that exhibited larger size and higher leverage measures. In the absence of a clear regulatory framework, prior to SSAP No. 20, the financial reporting of translation gains and losses displayed significant variation and inconsistencies. Overall, firms anticipated the issue of SSAP No. 20 and tended to recognise the translation differences in the balance sheet. © 2004 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

It provides an economic analysis of society’s responses to crime and a strategy intended to improve cost-effectiveness in the criminal justice system, while maintaining public confidence. The recommendation for a National Offender Management Service was accepted without further consultation and the new body is to be established from 1st June 2004. This decision signals the end of the probation service as a separate entity. It will create a market to ‘ensure the end-to-end management of offenders, regardless of whether they were given a custodial or community sentence’ (Home Office, 2004, p. 14). The author examines Carter’s likely impact on the prison population and sets the review alongside the social policy analysis provided by the Social Exclusion Unit (2002). He identifies risks that must be accounted for in the development and implementation of this ambitious plan.

      "Abstract: Declining populations in rural and regional areas have become a high political priority in Australia. Calls for measures to support rural communities have been prompted by substantial population declines in some country areas. In Europe and the USA, similar political pressures to halt population losses in rural and regional areas are also apparent; often as a component of the multifunctionality of agriculture. The question addressed in the present paper is whether or not the Australian tax-paying public would be willing to pay to avoid losses of people from rural and regional areas that may result from environmental protection measures. As an integral component of two recent non-market, environmental valuation exercises using Choice Modelling, the value of the benefits associated with the maintenance of rural populations has been estimated. The results demonstrate that a positive existence value is held primarily by urban dwellers for rural population levels. © Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this article, we analyze the financial risk propensity of business founders using a unique, representative dataset of nascent entrepreneurs in the United States. We deploy two models of entrepreneurial behavior: a strategic model of risk tolerance, based on investment choices; and a non-strategic model of risk tolerance, based on information bias about business success. For both models, our empirical results consistently show that nascent entrepreneurs are more risk-averse than non-entrepreneurs. To reconcile the financial risk aversion of entrepreneurs with the high risk of financial loss among startups, we suggest that many of the motivations that individuals have for founding business ventures are non-pecuniary in nature. © 2004, Sage Publications.

The subjects provided nearly five hours of care daily to a cognitively impaired parent and composed an average of 5.21 plans for caregiving in the coming two weeks. Subjects reflecting a hands-on, personal approach to caregiver planning reported significantly lower ratings for emotional arousal and perceived risk for loss of health than other subjects. Subjects reflecting an instrumental approach to planning, in addition, composed significantly more abstract plans directed to concerns about personal or relational sense of security. Subjects composing plans reflective of their grief provided significantly fewer hours of parental care and composed fewer plans for parental care than other subjects.

The research revealed issues of lack of control and information for children after a parental death. Forty-seven per cent of those in the study attended the funeral of their parent. There was correlation between the age of children and attendance at the funeral. Of the fifty-three per cent of children not attending, twenty-four per cent of them were forbidden to attend, whilst eleven per cent of them were distracted from attending the funeral, such as being sent to school or a neighbours and being unaware that it was taking place. None of the children attending the funeral reported any negative experiences, and two thirds of them reported it as a positive or helpful event. In contrast, over three-quarters of those not attending later wished that they had. Over a third had feelings of regret, others feeling that they had been excluded from the family at the time of the death, and felt anger, hurt, and frustration. The conclusion was that the best strategy is to give children informed choice about whether or not to attend. If children do attend a negative outcome seems unlikely, but it would be prudent to prepare them as to what to expect at the ceremony. © NAPCE 2004.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Rationale: Despite a well-established relationship between alcohol and risky behavior in the natural environment, laboratory investigations have not reliably shown acute alcohol effects on human risk-taking. Objectives: The present study was designed to demonstrate a dose-response relationship between acute alcohol administration and human risk taking. Further, this investigation sought to delineate behavioral mechanisms that may be involved in alcohol-induced changes in the probability of risky behavior. Methods: Using a laboratory measure of risk taking designed to address acute drug effects, 16 adults were administered placebo, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 g/kg alcohol in a within-subject repeated measures experimental design. The risk-taking task presented subjects with a choice between two response options operationally defined as risky and non-risky. Data analyses examined: breath alcohol level (BAL), subjective effects, response rates, distribution of choices between the risky and non-risky option, and trial-by-trial probabilities of making losing and winning risky responses. Results: The alcohol administration produced the expected changes in BAL, subjective effects, and response rate. Alcohol dose-dependently increased selection of the risky response option, and at the 0.8 g/kg dose, increased the probability of making consecutive losing risky responses following a gain on the risky response option. Conclusions: Acute alcohol administration can produce measurable changes in human risk-taking under laboratory conditions. Shifts in trial-by-trial response probabilities suggest insensitivity to past rewards and more recent losses when intoxicated, an outcome consistent with previous studies. This shift in sensitivity to consequences is a possible mechanism in alcohol-induced changes in risk taking.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although the theoretical importance of expectations in decision-making is well known to economists, only a few empirical papers investigate the impact of individual subjective expectations on economic outcomes. This paper examines the link between expectations of future job losses and the subsequent impact that these expectations have on household consumption behavior. The first part of the paper documents the empirical relationship between job loss expectations and subsequent job losses. Subjective job loss expectations have significant predictive power in explaining future job losses even when standard demographic information known to be associated with the prevalence of job displacement is included in the analysis. Furthermore, higher subjective job loss probabilities are correlated with an increased expectation of future earnings declines. Overall, these results indicate that the variable for subjective job loss expectations is a meaningful predictor of subsequent displacement. Since a job displacement results in large and persistent earnings losses, job loss expectations should have an important impact on household consumption smoothing following a job loss. The second part of the paper finds that although a job loss significantly reduces household consumption, there is little evidence that the degree to which households anticipate job losses reduces the impact of displacement on consumption. Alternative models of interpreting responses to expectations questions and of household consumption behavior that may explain these results are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: During fiscal year 1997 the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport of Japan introduced a system for evaluating road investment projects that considers reduction of road accidents as well as savings in time and running costs. However, the unit cost to calculate the benefit of reducing road accidents was not based on willingness to pay. In this study, we estimated the weight of road injuries against fatalities based on Japanese people’s preferences by a standard gamble approach. In the primary investigation, we estimated the weight of serious injuries based on social preference as well as usual private preference; no obvious differences were observed. Our results were slightly larger than those in the United Kingdom. In the secondary investigation, we estimated the weight of slight injuries and serious injuries using standard gambles. We prepared two questionnaires to assess whether differences in choices affect the results. There was no conclusive proof either way. Finally, we expressed the loss of road injuries in monetary terms by multiplying the weight of injuries to the value of a statistical life and derived a much higher estimate of total costs due to accidents than did the Japanese government. © 2004, Springer Japan.\u001b[0m :\n",

The estimated parameters and the measures of risk aversion indicate some spatial variation.

In developing the spatial model of fishing behavior, the work incorporates ideas of congestion and information effects, and we show a modification of standard welfare measures that accounts for these spillover effects. Using this methodology, these effects are traced through to the policy simulations, where we demonstrate how these welfare and predicted shares need to be modified to account for spillover effects from fleet activity.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background. This study was performed to assess renal transplant patient preferences with respect to the acceptance of an additional mortality risk induced by immunosuppressive therapy in order to prevent graft loss in case of acute rejection. Methods. The two decision analysis tools standard gamble and time trade-off were used to interview 155 patients with a functioning renal graft, and 11 on dialysis awaiting transplantation. Results. Defining the best possible outcome as being alive with a functioning graft (utility value = 1), and the worst outcome as dying (utility value = 0), median utility values of 0.68 (0.59 ± 0.32, mean ± SD) with standard gamble and of 0.65 (0.57 ± 0.32) with time trade-off were obtained for the intermediate outcome (i.e., staying alive but returning to dialysis). Thirteen percent of the patients attributed a utility value of 0 to this intermediate outcome (i.e., they would rather die than return to dialysis), and 8% a utility value of 1 (i.e., they would take absolutely no risk from additional antirejection therapy). Individual utility values for returning to dialysis correlated with time on dialysis before transplantation (R = 0.76, P < 0.005), but no relationship was found between utility values and age, sex, religion, previous methods of dialysis, time with a functioning graft, number of transplantations, or time on the transplantation waiting list. Conclusion. The large interindividual variability of utility values precludes a prediction about the acceptance of a new therapeutic regimen by an individual patient. The assessment of the utility enables, however, a more objective judgment of the general acceptance of any possible risk/benefit ratio induced by a new immunosuppressive regimen in our patient population.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Laboratory research studying behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game is consistent with the commonplace perception that social exchange is risky. Although they often do cooperate, people also often defect. Thus, the decision to enter a PD game with a stranger, about whom one has no good basis for predicting behavior, is a bet on cooperation. Many investigators have explored a range of cognitive processes and individual differences putatively bearing on the choice to enter such games, but few have asked how people perceive, assess, and respond to social risk in general. That is what we ask here. From the well known finding that people are risk-averse in the domain of gains and risk-tolerant in the domain of losses, we predict that, with game incentives constant, people will be more willing to enter social relationships when game payoffs are framed as losses than when they are framed as gains. We tested this prediction in a student population playing PD games. Results strongly supported the prediction, suggesting that human sociality may have evolved more as a defensive response to the possibility of loss than as an opportunistic attempt to capture gain.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: C. Wright Mills called for a truly sociological analysis of actors' \"motive talk,\" which decouples the commonsense link between the reasons actors give for their actions and their mental state prior to those actions. Subsequent theoretical and empirical work has focused almost entirely on actors' retrospective accounting for untoward conduct that has already taken place. The other aspect of Mills's program, the reasons actors give for potentially untoward future conduct and in particular the empirical investigation of the link between the availability of an acceptable vocabulary of motives for anticipated conduct and the eventual enactment of that conduct, has been largely ignored. This article seeks to rehabilitate these lost dimensions using data from a longitudinal study of mothers' infant feeding choices and practices. It examines how mothers account, in advance, for the possibility that they may eventually feed their babies in ways they consider suboptimal. Thirty of the thirty-six women interviewed indicated that they intended to breastfeed, emphasizing the benefits of this practice to their babies. However, seventeen of these women also anticipated that they might abandon breastfeeding and presented elaborate accounts of the motives that could lead them to do so. The findings support Mills's claim that the availability of an acceptable vocabulary of motives for untoward conduct increases the probability that one will engage in such conduct. Mothers who had offered elaborate anticipatory accounts for abandoning breastfeeding were much more likely to do so than those who did not.\u001b[0m :\n",

The question asked in this work is whether a threat of disappearance changes the way people value such options. In four experiments using \"door games,\" we demonstrate that options that threaten to disappear cause decision makers to invest more effort and money in keeping these options open, even when the options themselves seem to be of little interest. This general tendency is shown to be resilient to information about the outcomes, to increased experience, and to the saliency of the cost. The last experiment provides initial evidence that the mechanism underlying the tendency to keep doors open is a type of aversion to loss rather than a desire for flexibility.\u001b[0m :\n",

Why do individuals, many of whom are aware of the possible grave consequences of low-level insecure behaviors such as failure to backup work and disclosing passwords, continue to engage in unsafe computing practices? In this article we propose a conceptual model of this behavior as the outcome of a boundedly-rational choice process. We explore this model in a survey of undergraduate students (N = 167) at two large public universities. We asked about the frequency with which they engaged in five commonplace but unsafe computing practices, and probed their decision processes with regard to these practices. Although our respondents saw themselves as knowledgeable, competent users, and were broadly aware that serious consequences were quite likely to result, they reported frequent unsafe computing behaviors. We discuss the implications of these findings both for further research on risky computing practices and for training and enforcement policies that will be needed in the organizations these students will shortly be entering.\u001b[0m :\n",

We explore the impact of consumers' relationship perceptions, the nature of benefits offered by marketers in exchange for requested information, and the type of information requested on consumers' disclosure willingness, focusing on consumers' forecasts of 2 types of potential disclosure-related loss (i.e., loss of privacy and loss of face), which are shown to mediate this decision. The results of an experiment revealed that although participants with relatively deep relationship perceptions were more likely to reveal \" privacy-related\" personal information, they were more reluctant to reveal embarrassing information. The findings also suggest that although loyal customers found the exchange of privacy-related personal information for customized benefit offerings (relative to noncustomized offerings) attractive, the reverse was true for embarrassing information; these participants seemed to find the exchange of customized offerings for this latter type of information unattractive. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the findings for consumer researchers and relationship-seeking marketing practitioners.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Promotional and marketing strategies can be effective tools for raising and maintaining the profile of occupational health and safety (OHS) within an organization. It is important to maximize the impact of health and safety promotions, and to ensure a consistent, desired message is conveyed. When developing OHS promotional campaigns, consideration should be given to identifying the target audience and the objective of the campaign. The aim is to keep employees focused in a positive and proactive way. Effective communication brings together people, processes, and systems. The challenge is to promote health and safety throughout all levels of the organization, and to find effective strategies such as published materials, displays, media, training and the Internet, to gain management commitment and employee involvement in the decision-making and problem-solving processes which are essential for achieving a positive safety culture. The benefits can go beyond lowering the lost time injury rate, and can include economic and social gains. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although neoclassical economic theory predicts that fixed cost magnitude and fixed cost reporting format will not influence short-term pricing decisions, these factors systematically affected pricing decisions in a duopoly experiment. Increasing fixed cost magnitude (a pure sunk cost in this study) across experimental conditions caused participants to first lower, then raise, competitive prices. Consistent with the psychological phenomenon of loss aversion, this change in pricing behavior reduced the frequency of reported losses. This study further reveals that the accounting format for reporting fixed costs influenced pricing behavior. Specifically, participants receiving capacity costing feedback reports established increasingly lower selling prices relative to the prices established by participants receiving contribution margin feedback reports. Given that a very simple cosmetic reporting manipulation produced increasingly significant competitive pricing differences in a market setting, this study provides evidence that functional fixation is not necessarily eliminated by market forces.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Development of affective decision-making was studied in 48 children at two ages (3 and 4 years) using a simplified version of the Iowa Gambling Task (Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994). On each of 50 trials, children chose from 1 of 2 decks of cards that, when turned, displayed happy and sad faces, corresponding to rewards (candies) won and lost, respectively. Cards in 1 deck offered more rewards per trial, but were disadvantageous across trials due to occasional large losses; cards in the other deck offered fewer rewards per trial, but were advantageous overall. On later trials, 4-year-olds made more advantageous choices than 3-year-olds, and 4-year-olds made more advantageous choices than would be expected by chance, whereas 3-year-olds made more disadvantageous choices than would be expected by chance. These findings, which were especially pronounced for girls, indicate that affective decision-making develops rapidly during the preschool period, possibly reflecting the growth of neural systems involving orbitofrontal cortex. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 people attending a commercial slimming organization in South Yorkshire. The study revealed weight loss decisions to be complex and fragile. The experiences reported mirror the 'stages of change' model described by Prochaska and DiClemente (1992). Triggers to action occurred cumulatively and decisions were reached gradually. The triggers included embarrassment and humiliation, health, fear, critical events and image. Disincentives to action were denial, previous bad experiences, previous failure and money. Decisions were linked to low self-esteem and confidence, making people vulnerable at the point they take action.

      "Abstract: A high percentage of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients show cognitive impairments in addition to the cardinal motor symptoms. These deficits primarily concern executive functions most probably linked to dysfunctions in prefrontal regions due to decreased dopaminergic transmission in fronto-striatal loops. To investigate possible associations between decision-making and executive functions in PD, we examined 20 non-demented PD patients and 20 healthy control subjects with a neuropsychological test battery and the Game of Dice Task. In this computerised decision-making task, the rules for gains and losses and the winning probabilities are obvious and stable. Thus, strategic components besides feedback processing might influence decision-making in this task. We found that PD patients were impaired in the Game of Dice task performance and that the frequency of disadvantageous choices correlated with both executive functions and feedback processing. We suggest that decision-making deficits of PD patients in explicit gambling situations might be associated with dysfunctions in two different fronto-striatal loops: the limbic-orbitofrontal-striatal loop, involved in feedback processing, and the dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal loop, involved in executive functions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risk management decisions often demand the allocation of scarce resources in mitigation of different hazards. A quantitative basis for decision-making can be provided by a detailed risk assessment, in which the current risk and those that obtain under proposed projects can be evaluated. The average annual loss, or expected value, is not a useful measure of extreme risk. The conditional expected value, calculated for a series of probability ranges, provides measures of the risk that can be assembled into a decision table so that informed decisions can be made. The conditional expected value can be calculated even when the losses are only available in terms of a cumulative probability function.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In strategic decision situations, as modeled in games, the outcome depends on all decision-makers involved. In such situations, people make different decisions when they move simultaneously as compared to when they move sequentially without knowledge of prior moves. This is called the timing effect, which is not predicted by classic game theory. We hypothesize that pseudo-sequential game structures activate concepts of social interactions, which in turn increase individual's interpersonal trust and decreases cautiousness in situations of interdependence. Simultaneous game structures are more likely to activate concepts of games of chances, as a consequence of which the possibility of an actual total loss is more salient. In four experiments, participants played a coordination game either simultaneously or pseudo-sequentially. We manipulated processing time (Experiment 1), assessed participants' perception of game features (Experiment 2), manipulated activation of concepts such as social interaction (Experiment 3), and asked participants what decision they make being in a social interaction or a game of a chance (Experiment 4). The results support our hypothesis that different cognitive processes, which either intensify or diminish the focus on the other person, mediate the timing effect. In Experiment 5 we reversed the timing effect by embedding the game in a competitive context. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study examines self-reported reactions and performance when facing risks and dangers on peacekeeping observer missions. The sample consisted of 154 military observers. A self-made questionnaire, including the General Health Questionnaire and the Sense of Coherence (SOC) scale, was used. We found that feelings of invulnerability were common in relation to mission risks. In a specific danger incident, most participants subjectively performed well, although partial loss of cognitive functioning was reported in half of the cases and severely dysfunctional reactions in about one tenth. Cluster analysis showed that self-reported cognitive limitations in danger incidents were related to 2 factors: complicating situational factors, such as high levels of threat, complex decision demands, and minor control possibilities; and individual vulnerability factors, such as general worry and anger, low SOC, anxiety, and psychosomatic symptoms.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Behavioral studies of individual traders' decisions indicate that the \"disposition effect\" - the propensity of traders to ride losses yet realize gains - is motivated by psychological rather than rational economic considerations. Consistent with previous studies by Heisler [Rev. Futures Markets 13 (1994) 793], Odean [J. Finance 53 (1998) 1775] and Locke and Mann [Do professional traders exhibit loss realization aversion? Working Paper, George Washington University, 2000], we find evidence of a disposition effect for both on-floor professional futures traders (\"locals\") and a matched sample of non-local traders. After controlling for potential differences in trader characteristics, comparisons reveal a stronger disposition effect among locals than non-local traders. Given that locals must trade profitably to survive, it is improbable that they are more irrational in their loss riding than non-locals. To the contrary, evidence is provided that paper losses for local traders are more likely than for non-locals to become either realized or paper gains by the time of the next transaction. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that locals, by their presence on the trading floor, have privileged albeit short-lived information on order flow that allows them to form relatively accurate probability predictions of the direction and strength of short-term market price shifts. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In Study 1, narcissism predicted overconfidence. This was attributable to narcissists' greater confidence despite no greater accuracy. In Study 2, participants were offered fair bets on their answers. Narcissists lost significantly more points in this betting task than non-narcissists, due both to their greater overconfidence and greater willingness to bet. Finally, in Study 3, narcissists' predictions of future performance were based on performance expectations rather than actual performance.

      "Abstract: This study examined whether individuals with substance dependence (ISDs) show impairments in working memory and whether there is a relationship between their impairments in decision making as measured by the gambling task (GT) paradigm and working memory as measured by a delayed nonmatching to sample (DNMS) task. Using the GT, 11% of healthy control participants and 61% of ISDs opted for choices with high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. For the ISDs and controls with equal GT impairments, the ISDs performed significantly lower than controls on the DNMS task. The nonimpaired ISDs on the GT also performed significantly worse than matched controls on the DNMS task. The DNMS task deficit in ISDs was across all delay times, suggesting the deficit may lie in the \"executive\" process of working memory, which supports earlier findings (E. M. Martin et al., 2003). The authors suggest that the prefrontal cortex hosts multiple distinct mechanisms of decision making and inhibitory control and that ISDs may be affected in any one or combination of them.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper highlights some unpleasant macroeconomic effects that could occur during this interval. The problem is cast as a two-stage sequential game between private agents and the government of the applicant country. The policy-maker decides whether to devaluate the domestic currency or not at two distinct dates; it makes a last choice just before accession to the monetary union. Under an assumption of incomplete information of private agents about the government's priorities on inflation and economic activity, the game presents a hybrid perfect Bayesian equilibrium. In the pooling configuration, an initial policy of zero devaluation does not signal the final devaluation decision. As private agents cannot completely rule out the risk of a 'last devaluation', a premium adds to interest rates and entails a systematic output loss.\u001b[0m :\n",

Camerer (1995) and Rabin (1998) provide excellent reviews of the relevant literature. These results clearly display the gap between normative theories of ideal behavior and descriptive theories of observed behavior. The most prominent result is loss aversion - the observation that a loss is given greater value than a gain of an equal size - and the resulting S-shaped utility function. Rabin puts the key point as follows: \"Researchers have identified a pervasive feature of reference dependence: In a wide variety of domains, people are significantly more averse to losses than they are attracted to same size gains\" (Rabin 1998, 13-14). In what follows, I will show that the \"wide variety of domains\" is wide indeed. In particular, I will review the effects of the S-shaped utility function on the resolution of the decision to commit a crime, to decision to violate professional ethics, and the decision to participate in a rebellion. © 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

They also respond to probabilities in a non-linear manner.

Using longitudinal data for a cohort of recent immigrants to Australia, it examines whether migrants' permanent settlement intention reported soon after arrival is related to their family sponsorship patterns and intention to sponsor, and whether family sponsorship patterns and intention in turn have an effect on immigrants' permanent settlement/return migration decision. The results show that a significant relation exists between sponsorship of close family members for migration and immigrants' permanent settlement intention and that the relation is particularly strong among skilled migrants. The study demonstrates the importance of kinship ties in permanent settlement and return migration decisions and suggests that liberal policies on family reunion migration may minimize settle loss, especially among skilled immigrants.\u001b[0m :\n",

The detection and management of sensory loss in the elderly plays a key role in the Australian Government's Healthy Ageing Strategy. Age-related macular degeneration is currently the leading cause of blindness in elderly Australians. Although a large proportion of AMD cases remain untreatable, the introduction of photodynamic therapy provides a relatively expensive and possibly cost-effective innovation for others. Antioxidant therapy has also been proven effective in reducing progression of early to late disease. The discipline of economics can contribute to an understanding of AMD prevention and treatment through: (i) describing the current burden of disease; (ii) predicting the changes in the burden of disease overtime, and (iii) evaluating the efficiency of different interventions. Cost-of-illness studies have been performed in many fields of medicine. Little work, however, has been done on describing the economic impact from AMD. A number of different economic evaluation methods can be used in judging the efficiency of possible interventions to reduce the disease burden of AMD. Although complementary in nature, each has specific uses and limitations.

It was hypothesized that after terrorists' attacks people would make more conservative and less risky decisions, as a way of compensating for the feelings of insecurity caused by the disaster. Prospect Theory is used as theoretical framework. This theory has successfully accounted for decision making under normal circumstances. To verify whether and how the terrorists' attack against the USA influenced individual decision making processes, two samples of Italian university students were tested, one month and six months after the disaster. The results show the emergence of two tendencies, which are absent during 'normal' historical periods: a strong, long-term lasting search for security when the outcome of a decision is perceived as a gain, and a medium-term risk avoiding behavior in the loss domain.

      "Abstract: Pest management decisions of Asian rice farmers are often based on biased heuristics. They generally overestimate losses from pest attack and thus make unnecessary insecticide sprays - a loss aversion behavior. A participatory exercise to facilitate the computation of yield loss from white head symptoms of rice stem borers was found to effectively help rice farmers make adjustments to their biases. After participating in the exercise, farmers reduced their insecticide sprays for stem borer control by 22% and their intended insecticide expenditures by 45%. The control farmers on the other hand did not reduce their sprays and reduced their intended expenditures by only 14%. Farmers who had done the exercise reduced their estimated loss from white head by 27%, while there was no reduction in control farmers. Similarly, farmers also reduced their control expenditures and perceptions of loss by 43% and 54%, respectively, while control farmers' reductions were lower, 22% and 31%, respectively. Compared to the control farmers, higher reductions in beliefs were also found in farmers exposed to this exercise. This participatory exercise has the potential of being implemented in extension, training and mass communication programs to motivate rice farmers to manage stem borers more efficiently. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Living kidney donor programs, based on willingness among family members and close relatives to donate, have made it possible to perform a satisfactory number of kidney transplantations. Early graft loss in the recipient may occur and it is not known if such an event will result mainly in acute, rather transient, emotional reactions or if long-lasting reactions may be evoked in the living kidney donor. The aim of the present study was to assess and describe the remaining experiences of donors (n = 10) more than 3 yr after early recipient graft loss or death of the recipient. A phenomenographic, interview-based research approach was used. Five different fields or domains were identified: (i) the decision to donate; (ii) the information provided; (iii) care received at the time of donation; (iv) responses at graft failure; and (v) concerns remaining at the time of the interview. All donors expressed that they had volunteered to donate and that no stress had been put on them. The information given prior to and in connection with the donation procedure was deemed insufficient but all donors were satisfied with the medical care provided in connection with the nephrectomy and in the immediate post-operative period. Graft failure was immediately accepted on the intellectual level by nine of 10 donors but still evoked emotional reactions and responses included a wish that continuing contact with the transplant staff had been provided. The present interview-based study shows that it is of importance that the donor is thoroughly informed about all donor as well as recipient-related factors including the potential risk of recipient graft failure. In case of graft failure, or the death of the recipient, the transplant unit staff members should offer contact for discussions of medical matters as well as for psychosocial support. In individual cases it may be necessary to maintain such a supportive contact channel for a prolonged period of time.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Supporters of direct uninvited solicitation activities argue that clients can make more informed choices of auditors when auditors are allowed to solicit prospective clients. In banned markets, auditors are allowed to submit bids to provide audit services only when invited by the client. This study provides theoretical models that examine the efficiency of client-auditor alignments in the banned and allowed market. We identify conditions under which realignment differences between the two markets occur and derive client losses in the banned market as compared to the allowed market. We also identify conditions under which independence may be impaired in the allowed market, consistent with the claims of solicitation opponents. However, we believe that, in view of the potential positive effects related to audit pricing and client-auditor alignment, restrictions on advertising or direct uninvited solicitation are not necessarily indicated. Instead, regulators or market mechanisms should insure that the independence (truth-telling) condition is so readily satisfied as to be virtually irrelevant. This can happen in one of two ways: (a) increased scrutiny, leading to an increased likelihood of discovery, or (b) increased penalties when an audit failure is discovered, leading to increased costs of an audit failure, or both. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract: Between 1997 and 2000, the United Nations Compensation Commission delivered US$4000 apiece to roughly 87,000 Sri Lankan citizens who suffered displacement and loss of employment due to Iraq's military actions in Kuwait during the Gulf War. Using qualitative ethnographic data, this essay examines 11 case studies of Kuwait returnees in the village of Naeaegama, in southern Sri Lanka. Like the majority of Sri Lankans caught in the Gulf War, these returnees are women from poor rural families who worked as domestic servants in Kuwait. The paper compares how the 11 households have spent compensation money and migrants' remittances. Spending choices reveal a clear hierarchy of priorities: buying land and building a house, providing a dowry for unmarried women, and starting a viable business. These goals reflect family-based considerations, and use of the money illustrates the family's role as an economic as well as a social unit. The paper also explores the role of family in facilitating migration and depressing women's wages on the global market. Data reveal the local values, motives, and cultural contexts that shape individual and family decision-making on matters of finance and migration. Family choices are products of and adaptations to globalised contexts. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Methods: Self-selected enrollees completed questionnaires, including QOL scales, at 3-month intervals. Repeated measures multiple regression analysis was used to examine the association between the QOL scales and comorbidities, adverse effects, and compliance measures, controlling for other factors. Results: We included 569 participants in the analysis, with a mean time since transplantation of 8.6 years. Cross-sectional results showed that the number of comorbidities, treatment non-compliance, and several adverse effects were associated with low QOL. In longitudinal results, waiting to take medications and taking less medication because of lifestyle restrictions were associated with decreases in QOL over time. Hair loss, changes in face shape, and decreased sexual interest or ability also had the largest adverse effects on changes in QOL. Conclusions: These findings provide new opportunities for interventions to address factors related to decreases in QOL. Clinicians should actively solicit information about compliance with medication regimens. In addition, information about the adverse effects of medications should be considered when making therapeutic decisions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The design, refurbishment and future decommissioning of nuclear reactors are crucially concerned with reducing the risk of radiation exposure that can result in adverse health effects and potential loss of life. To address this concern, large financial investments have been made to ensure safety of operating nuclear power plants worldwide. The efficacy of the expenditures incurred to provide safety must be judged against the safety benefit to be gained from such investments. We have developed an approach that provides a defendable basis for making that judgement. If the costs of risk reduction are disproportionate to the safety benefits derived, then the expenditures are not optimal; in essence the societal resources are being diverted away from other critical areas such as health care, education and social services that also enhance the quality of life. Thus, the allocation of society's resources devoted to nuclear safety must be continually appraised in light of competing needs, because there is a limit on the resources that any society can devote to extend life. The purpose of the paper is to present a simple and methodical approach to assessing the benefits of nuclear safety programs and regulations. The paper presents the Life-Quality Index (LQI) as a tool for the assessment of risk reduction initiatives that would support the public interest and enhance both safety and the quality of life. The LQI is formulated as a utility function consistent with the principles of rational decision analysis. The LQI is applied to quantify the societal willingness-to-pay (SWTP) for safety measures enacted to reduce of the risk of potential exposures to ionising radiation. The proposed approach provides essential support to help improve the cost-benefit analysis of engineering safety programs and safety regulations. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: The reflection effect (D. Kahneman & A. Tversky, 1979) was investigated using the stochastic model of choice developed by C. González-Vallejo (2002). The model assumes that individuals make trade-offs among attribute values by relying on a difference variable. The model also specifies a threshold representing individual proclivities to reach to attribute differences. Two experiments demonstrated that changes in risk attitudes, from a gain to a loss situation, depended on the stimuli as well as on individuals' thresholds. Thresholds were generally lower in losses than in gains, indicating a risk-taking tendency. Thresholds were also lower when participants were endowed with greater savings. Model testing revealed better fits for the stochastic model than cumulative prospect theory (A. Tversky & D. Kahneman, 1992).\u001b[0m :\n",

It turns out that, by choosing the game which gives the highest average earnings at each step, one ends up with systematic losses, whereas a periodic or random sequence of choices yields a steadily increase of the capital. An explanation of this behavior is given by noting that the short-range maximization of the returns is \"killing the goose that laid the golden eggs\".

      "Abstract: Objective: The characteristics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) include abnormalities in reward responsivity that may interfere with decision making. The study examined reward responsivity in ADHD by comparing the neural correlates of decision making in adults with childhood-onset ADHD and in healthy adults. Method: The neural correlates of performance on a decision-making task and a control task were compared in 10 adults with ADHD and 12 age-matched healthy volunteers by using [15O]H2O positron emission tomography. The decision-making task tested the ability to weigh short-term rewards against long-term losses. The control task matched all components of the decision-making task except for the decision-making process and related contingency. Results: The ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the insula were activated during performance of the decision-making task in both the ADHD and healthy groups; however, activation in the ADHD group was less extended and did not involve other regions, such as anterior cingulate and hippocampus, that subserve emotion/memory processes. Direct comparison of data from the ADHD subjects and the healthy volunteers suggested that the healthy subjects engaged the hippocampal and insular regions more than did the ADHD subjects and that the ADHD subjects recruited the caudal part of the right anterior cingulate more than did the healthy subjects. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the neural circuits engaged during decision making differ in subjects with ADHD and healthy comparison subjects. This difference may explain observed deficits in motivated behaviors in ADHD. A better understanding of the nature of these deficits could ultimately be applied to refine treatment strategies for ADHD.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Do individuals make rational, well-planned retirement age decisions? Evidence is not conclusive; some decisions seem to be quite reasonable, while others, including the long-term trends generated by these decisions, seem irrational. In order to be able to predict and influence these important decisions, the process leading up to making them needs to be better understood. The process an individual uses to make a retirement decision may be influenced by a rational allocation of money, time, and effort, as suggested by a utility-maximizing Household Production approach. Alternately, the decision process may be strongly influenced by an anchor, defined by the retirement ages chosen by friends, neighbors, relatives, and colleagues, as suggested by Anchoring and Prospect Theory. Studies investigating anchoring and risk-seeking or risk-aversion behavior, which results when a target is seen as a loss or a gain from the anchor, have found that individuals make irrational decisions under many different circumstances. A set of retirement decision propositions, which hypothesize that the heuristic of Anchoring and the resulting cognitive biases described by Prospect Theory will influence the chosen retirement age, are developed in this paper. Retirement information provided by the employer is a possible moderator that may reduce the influence of the anchor on the retirement decision; a set of moderator hypotheses are also developed in this paper. Propositions strongly supported by existing research predict that, unless sufficient information regarding retirement issues is used by an individual, he or she is likely to choose an inappropriate retirement age. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

A roaring wildfire was consuming thousands of acres of pristine forests, and tourism activities and expenditures were evaporating as the fire and smoke spread. Chief Executive Officer Allen Harper found himself caught between a rock and a hard place as the fire danger increased. Continuing to run the coal-fired trains in the isolated tinder dry mountains could cause additional fires, and firefighting resources were already stretched.

      "Abstract: Children permanently separated from their birth families have to manage life-long issues of attachment, identity and loss. This article focuses on the issue of post-placement contact and discusses the qualities of foster carers and adopters that can best help children negotiate such issues when contact occurs. Two linked research studies provide data on young adopted children, and children in middle childhood placed in long-term foster care. Almost all foster children were found to be having frequent face-to-face contact, compared with only a small minority of adopted children. However, face-to-face contact was found to be more straightforward in the adoptive families, largely because such young children had less complex relationships with their birth relatives and easier relationships with their new parents. Adopters were centrally involved in contact meetings and able to act autonomously, whereas the experience of foster carers was much more varied, with some feeling excluded from decision-making. In both placement types, sensitive and empathic thinking and accepting values of foster carers and adopters were vital in helping children use contact meetings to make sense of their membership of two families. When such parental attributes were present, a wide range of contact arrangements could be successful.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Cocaine abusers demonstrate faulty decision-making as manifested by their inability to discontinue self-destructive drug-seeking behaviors. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays an important role in decision-making. In this preliminary study we tested whether 25-day-abstinent cocaine abusers show alterations in normalized cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the OFC using PET with 15O during the Iowa Gambling Task (a decision-making task). This task measures the ability to weigh short-term rewards against long-term losses. A control task matched the sensorimotor aspects of the task but did not require decision-making. Cocaine abusers (N = 13) showed greater activation during performance of the Iowa Gambling Task in the right OFC and less activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and left medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) compared to a control group (N = 13). Better Iowa Gambling Task performance was associated with greater activation in the right OFC in both groups. Also, the amount of cocaine used (grams/week) prior to the 25 days of enforced abstinence was negatively correlated with activation in the left OFC. Greater activation in the OFC in cocaine abusers compared to a control group may reflect differences in the anticipation of reward while less activation in the DLPFC and MPFC may reflect differences in planning and working memory. These findings suggest that cocaine abusers show persistent functional abnormalities in prefrontal neural networks involved in decision-making and these effects are related to cocaine abuse. Compromised decision-making could contribute to the development of addiction and undermine attempts at abstinence. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) ought to be good news for employees; it gives them the freedom to retire early with a substantial sum of money, tax free, as compensation. But, in many Indian companies, VRS is retrenchment through the backdoor. Employees identified as redundant or undesirable are pressured to leave. That they have been ‘selected’ for VRS can be devastating news for them especially when finding alternative jobs with similar remuneration and social status is difficult. This paper explores the communication strategies that employers can adopt to deliver well the bad news of job loss. Researchers have been studying the role of communication in softening the blow of job termination. Their discussions tend to be around micro communication strategies that depend largely on the verbal component of the complex communication process. This paper illustrates and recommends a macro communication strategy that would: Ø actively deploy several mutually reinforcing non-verbal as well as verbal moves, especially a range of management actions that work down employee expectations Ø help employees perceive as fair both the company’s decision to downsize and the manner of downsizing. A review of several studies of perceived fairness prompts one to conclude that perception of distributive, procedural, and interactional justice helps people accept a variety of unpleasant experiences without anger. If they perceive procedural and interactional justice, they may even overlook low distributive justice. This paper identifies employee expectations that have to be met or worked down by organizations to facilitate the perception of fairness in their job termination. These include: Ø absence of viable alternatives to downsizing Ø adequacy of notice of termination Ø objectivity and transparency in selecting employees to be terminated Ø humaneness in the way the downsizees are treated. As culture and tradition largely determine the scope of some of these and similar expectations, this paper touches upon what Indian employees expect in the event of downsizing. This analysis is followed by a brief discussion of the way three Indian companies of different sizes – Pennar Industries Limited, Pennar Investor Services Private Limited, and Everest Limited – downsized. In the first two cases there was no litigation, violence or strike although the compensation paid was well below the employees’ original demand. In the third case there was litigation although an attractive compensation was offered to employees opting for VRS. The first two used a macro communication strategy that conveyed convincingly to the survivors and downsizees alike that Ø the decision to downsize was unavoidable Ø the low compensation offered was fair under the given circumstances Ø the company was treating the downsizees humanely. The third company relied largely on a micro communication strategy driven by logic and data; it did achieve its target of personnel reduction but failed to convince the employees of its fairness. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

      "Abstract: In this paper we are interested in the decision problem faced by an agent when requesting bids for collections of tasks with complex time constraints and interdependencies. In particular, we study the problem of specifying an appropriate schedule for the tasks in the request for bids. We expect bids to require resource commitments, so we expect different settings of time windows to solicit different bids and different costs. The agent is interested in soliciting \"desirable\" bids, where desirable means bids that can be feasibly combined in a low-cost combination that covers the entire collection of tasks. Since the request for bids has to be issued before the agent can see any bids, in this decision process there is a probability of loss as well as a probability of gain. This requires the decision process to deal with the risk posture of the person or organization on whose behalf the agent is acting. We describe a model based on Expected Utility Theory and show how an agent can attempt to maximize its profits while managing its financial risk exposure. We illustrate the operation and properties of the model and discuss what assumptions are required for its successful integration in multiagent contracting applications.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: To study the feelings of parents during and after termination of pregnancy (TOP) for fetal anomalies. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted before TOP, after six weeks and six months after TOP. The study group consisted of 89 couples, treated at our institution between 1994 and 1998, who terminated their pregnancy in the second and third trimester. Eighty-six of them participated in at least one of the three interviews. Results: Most parents were able to cope with the decisions they had to make, although a struggle between reason and emotion often occurred. Seeing the dead baby and saying farewell gave all parents a good feeling afterward. Feelings such as doubt, guilt, failure, shame, anger, anxiety and relief were experienced during the period of TOP and the following weeks but practically disappeared after six months; these feelings were more prevalent in women. Most of the couples mentioned that their relationship grew closer as a result of the loss and the grief. Relatives offered good support to most parents in the first weeks after delivery, but parents felt that this support lasted too short a time. Conclusions: Seeing the child and saying farewell and the medical and psychosocial support received from professional caregivers were of great value for the interviewees. Parents found the interviews helpful in the grieving process. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Common sense suggests that consumers make more satisfying decisions as they consider their options more closely. Yet we argue that such close consideration can have undesirable consequences because it may induce attachment to the options - a sense of prefactual ownership of the choice options. When consumers then select one option, they effectively lose this prefactual possession of the other, nonchosen options. This yields a feeling of discomfort (\"choosing feels like losing\") and an increase in the attractiveness of the forgone option, compared to its appeal before the choice. A series of nine experiments provides evidence of this phenomenon and support for our explanation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper is partly tutorial by presenting well known classical decision theory in a slightly untraditional form, but it does also present thinking and results that have not been published in the engineering literature before. The paper introduces the mathematical modeling basis for rational formulation of decision criteria and public acceptance criteria connected to risk analysis of technical operations that may endanger human life and property. Public restrictions on the decisions concerning the design, construction and managing of the technical operation have in the past been imposed on the basis of the frequency and severity of experienced adverse events. No clear rationale to decide how restrictive the public should be in setting a boundary for allowable risk seems to have been applied. To clarify this problem, focus is on the difficulty of simultaneously having two decision makers, the owner that tries to optimize the net gain of the operation, and the public that has somewhat different preferences than the owner, but also strong interests in the success of the owner. The principles of rational decision are needed for appreciation of the problem. Recognizing that there is an insurance compensation value of a human life and a public money equivalent of a human life, where the last value usually is considerably larger than the first value, it is possible from the decision analysis to determine an upper limit that the public should impose on the ratio of the owner's expected loss rate to the expected gain rate. The public money equivalent of a human life is assessed by use of a recently in (Nathwani JS, Lind NC, Pandey MD. Affordable safety by choice: the life quality method. Waterloo, Ontario, Canada: Institute for risk Research, University of Waterloo, 1997) suggested Life Quality Index (LQI) that combines wealth in terms of Gross Domestic Product per person, life expectancy at birth, and yearly work time into a single number. The philosophy behind the published evaluations is that the prevention of a loss of a life is counteracted by a cost such that the LQI remains unchanged (Skjong R, Ronold K.

The research question is reflected in two sets of hypotheses that experimentally examine the relationship between valenced (was the outcome good or bad) attributions (why did the outcome happen) and changes in the riskiness (chance and size of loss) of managers' new-product introduction decisions. Three-way interactions are found that support the study's attribution-based framework and address predictive differences among the four risk perspectives.

Ninety-nine students made 28 choices which affected outcomes (points to be converted into money) for themselves and another (unknown) person. About half of them started out with nothing but they could allocate positive outcomes (gains) to themselves and/or the other. The other half were told that they themselves and another person would start out with some outcomes but they could lose outcomes depending on the choices. For about half the participants it was certain that their choices would result in outcomes while for the other half outcomes would be likely rather than certain. The expected utility of the outcomes was the same in the four conditions. In accordance with prospect theory, it was expected and found that participants would be more individualistic in the conditions with losses than in the conditions with gains. In accordance with social comparison theory, it was expected and found that participants would be more competitive in the conditions with probable outcomes than in the conditions with certain outcomes.

      "Abstract: On-the-job training of new employees is often realised through the help of experienced workers. Considering the lack of verifiability of the human capital transmission process and the loss of insiders' bargaining power deriving from it, we examine some firms' hiring policies, based on family relationships, aimed to elicit the incumbent workforce's cooperation in training. We proceed by introducing the assumption that individuals are moved by intra-family altruism and maximise a family utility function rather than an individual one. The implications of this assumption in an insider-outsider framework are explored: the family ties between insiders and outsiders can modify the insiders' convenience in following a non-cooperative behaviour aimed at obtaining a higher wage. The insiders might try to influence firms' hiring decisions by offering to cooperate in the training process of outsiders belonging to their own family. This could explain the evidence showing that many firms in depressed labour markets hire members of the same family. © 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The study performs a joint estimation of the values for three important attributes of forest ecosystem management - biodiversity, aesthetics, and rural employment impacts using a choice-based, stated preference approach. It develops the marginal willingness-to-pay schedule for the three attributes for timber rural, other rural, and urban communities in Washington State. In contrast to the conventional wisdom in neoclassical economics, the public perceives job losses as losses of social welfare in this study. There are differences as well as similarities among the preferences of the three communities for the attributes of ecosystem management. The results show that the overall preferences of the timber rural and urban communities towards ecosystem management are substantially different, while the preferences of other rural community are not statistically significantly different from the other two communities. The estimated environmental and social values make it possible for policy makers and resource managers to compare and assess the trade-offs of different management plans. For example, with the biodiversity index level at 60, where an index of 50 relates current conditions, and rural forest-related job losses at 5,000, each household in urban communities in Washington State is willing to pay $31.44 annually for an additional unit of improvement of biodiversity, and $45.97 annually for avoiding an additional 1,000 rural job losses. The trade-off relationship for the given biodiversity and job loss levels suggests each household in urban communities each year is willing to trade 684 additional rural forest-related job losses with one unit of biodiversity improvement, ceteris paribus. Similar trade-off relationships for households in timber and other rural communities suggest each is willing to trade 598 and 388 additional rural forest-related job losses, respectively, with one unit of biodiversity improvement, ceteris paribus. The trade-off between aesthetics and job losses are 1,229, 452, and 686 additional jobs with one unit of aesthetics improvement for urban, timber, and other rural households, respectively. The trade-off relationships provide important information for improving the efficiency and equity of forest ecosystem management.\u001b[0m :\n",

Two time points were considered, after the event (short term), and a year later (long term). In Study 1, participants responded to scenarios depicting losses varying in degree of severity. As hypothesized, protagonists in the heavy loss cases were attributed with more regrets of omission (inaction) both in the short and in the long term. In the less severe loss scenarios, action regrets decreased significantly in the long term. In Study 2, one of the severe loss scenarios from Study 1 was presented with a less severe outcome. As expected, participants generated more inaction regrets in the severe loss version.

Using decision analysis we simulated a trial comparing diet and exercise therapy to laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery to determine which approach resulted in longer life expectancy. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision analysis model was constructed to evaluate survival after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery compared with a diet and exercise program for a 45-year-old woman with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 kg/m2. Baseline mortality data were derived from published tables of vital statistics, and the relative risks of death associated with obesity (relative to normal weight) were taken from epidemiologic studies. We assumed that successful surgery resulted in a reduction of BMI to 30 kg/m2. The baseline assumptions were: an operative mortality of 0.4%; a probability of weight loss after surgery of 80%; a rate of weight loss on a diet and exercise program, 20% at two years; a rate of regain of lost weight, 95% at two years; a relative risk of death for a BMI of 40 kg/m2, 2.70; and a relative risk of death for a BMI of 30 kg/m2, 1.51. RESULTS: The undiscounted life expectancy after surgery was 69.7 years compared with 67.3 years for a diet and exercise program (an absolute increase in life expectancy of 2.4 years, a relative increase in life expectancy of 10.8%). Sensitivity analyses assumed discounting at 5%/y, and showed that surgery was associated with a longer expectation of life when the risk of operative mortality was less than 10%, and when the probability of weight loss after surgery was greater than 4%. CONCLUSIONS: In a decision analysis model, laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity was associated with a substantially longer survival than diet and exercise therapy. © 2003 by the American College of Surgeons.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article analyzes the risk perception of traffic participants by making use of Prospect Theory. This methodology makes a conceptual distinction between the perception of risk and the perception of the outcome of an uncertain event. In the field of transport safety such a distinction is desirable, because risks are typically very low and thus sensitive to misperception by traffic participants. Taking into account such misperception will significantly improve estimates of the valuation of transport safety. The first empirical results show that the valuation of losses is well represented by a utility function that is concave in shape. Secondly, our preliminary results show that individuals base their choice mainly on the possible outcomes and not so much on probabilities whenever there are very small probabilities (say ≤1/100) and \"bad outcomes\" involved. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      "Abstract: In this study we examine how the introduction of a reference lottery with nonrandom outcomes alters the way in which choices among pairs of lotteries are made, even if it does not alter the choices. We use different domains (some of the lotteries produce gains, other losses) and different contexts (one member of the pair, the reference lottery, may be either risky or certain). In our experiment, the change from gain to loss domain affects choices: subjects are risk averse in the gain domain, but not in the loss domain. On the contrary, the context effect of the certain lottery does not affect choices. However, the introduction of the certainty reference lottery affects two behavioral variables, response time and brain activation, in a dramatic way. This result suggests that the certainty lottery promotes a different process through which preferences are revealed, even if the differences among lotteries may not be large enough to induce different choices.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Breast cancer patients' perception of illness could influence preferences in decision-making. According to Lipowsky, the meaning of illness might influence coping abilities and he suggests eight categories of meaning as prevalent in our culture: 'challenge', 'enemy', 'punishment', 'weakness', 'irreparable loss', 'relief', 'strategy' and 'value'. In this study 187 Swedish breast cancer patients chose one of these eight categories as their meaning of breast cancer. 'Challenge' was chosen most often, by 33% of all patients and by 40% of patients in middle life (51-65 years). Older patients (≥ 66 years) chose 'challenge' less frequently (17%) but chose 'relief', 'strategy' or 'value' more often than younger patients. The few patients with metastatic disease chose 'enemy', 'punishment', 'weakness' and 'irreparable loss' more often than patients in the earlier stages of disease. There were differences in perception of illness depending on patients' age and stage of disease but not depending on their preferences in decision-making.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives. To identify in women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer who had just undergone surgery the extent to which they (1) perceived that they had treatment options, (2) understood the treatment related risks and benefits, and (3) preferred to participate in the treatment decision-making process. Methods. This qualitative study included women who underwent initial surgery for stage 3 or 4 ovarian cancer and who had received less than two cycles of chemotherapy. In depth semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 patients between June 1999 and February 2001. The interviews were content analyzed according to the themes that arose in the interview. Results. Five themes were identified. (1) Knowledge of treatment benefits and risks. Women understood that the treatment had both survival and quality of life benefits. Women could clearly articulate the risks of chemotherapy. (2) Readiness to make a decision. When making treatment decisions, women described being overwhelmed by the effects of concurrent drugs like analgesics, the severity of the illness, unexpected diagnosis of cancer and grief, and feeling pressured into a decision. (3) Perception of a treatment choice. Most women felt that they made their treatment decision; however, most women did not perceive that they had a treatment choice. Thus, treatment decision making is really a process of coming to terms with the disease and the recommended treatment. (4) Physician-patient relationship. All women suggest that their doctor knew the right treatment for them and they felt confident in their cancer physician. (5) Social supports. Women described supports through decision-making processes that included individuals who advocated for them, faith, and past experience with the cancer system. Hindrances to decision making included people who were negative, the cancer label, and employers. Conclusions. Women with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer did not describe the treatment decision-making process as shared; rather they described an interaction that was directed largely by the physician. These women attribute this form of decision-making to their advanced age, severity of illness, immediate ramification of treatment choices, and lack of advocacy for a different model of interaction. Thus, the onus is on the physician to ensure that there is an environment for shared decision-making in the event that the patient is interested in such an interaction. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

By modelling bet size, the favourite-longshot bias observed in many pari-mutuel betting markets is shown to be consistent with both: (i) a representative bettor taking decisions, according to prospect theory, based on standard shaped value and weighting functions, and (ii) the bettor simply being risk loving for gains and risk averse for losses. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: Ovarian cancer may be particularly challenging for women, both physically and psychologically, because of the advanced nature of the disease at the time of diagnosis, the side effects of the disease, the repetitive cycles of aggressive therapy, and the perceived loss of femininity from the removal of reproductive organs. In addition, women with this disease rarely have an opportunity for cure. Most will face the very real possibility of dying. This qualitative study examined the perspectives of women living with ovarian cancer. Eighteen women participated in interviews, in which they described their experiences living with the disease. Women reported the myriad day-to-day changes in their lives, the major challenges they had to face, and the sources to which they turned for support. Implications for the practice of oncology nurses involve assessment, an understanding of the profound impact that this illness has on both the woman and her family, and the need to access a variety of supportive care programs.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Fisheries organisations in Scotland have repeatedly called for culls of common and grey seals, despite their conservation status and no supporting scientific evidence. This current study investigated the opinion of tourists in West Scotland as to whether seal populations should be reduced to manage their increasing numbers. The study also looks at whether such a cull would influence tourist behaviour. In total 735 interviews were conducted. There were regional differences in levels of opinion but, on average, 60% of respondents believed that seals should not be regulated and 17% stated that the instigation of a cull would affect their decision to visit Scotland on holiday. In the Highlands of Scotland alone this could represent over £100 million in lost tourism income. A boycott by tourists to the Highlands, as the result of introducing seal culls, could equate to a financial loss equivalent to a third of the total value of Scottish fisheries. Tourism is Scotland's main industry and is particularly important for the economy of rural areas. Any further proposals for seal culls should seriously consider the negative and indirect impacts these culls could have, such as reductions in tourist numbers and tourism income to a region. © 2003 E.C.M.

      "Abstract: This investigation compared the predictions of two models describing the integration of reinforcement and punishment effects in operant choice. Deluty's (1976) competitive-suppression model (conceptually related to two-factor punishment theories) and de Villiers' (1980) direct-suppression model (conceptually related to one-factor punishment theories) have been tested previously in non-humans but not at the individual level in humans. Mouse clicking by college students was maintained in a two-alternative concurrent schedule of variable-interval money reinforcement. Punishment consisted of variable-interval money losses. Experiment 1 verified that money loss was an effective punisher in this context. Experiment 2 consisted of qualitative model comparisons similar to those used in previous studies involving nonhumans. Following a no-punishment baseline, punishment was superimposed upon both response alternatives. Under schedule values for which the direct-suppression model, but not the competitive-suppression model, predicted distinct shifts from baseline performance, or vice versa, 12 of 14 individual-subject functions, generated by 7 subjects, supported the direct-suppression model. When the punishment models were converted to the form of the generalized matching law, least-squares linear regression fits for a direct-suppression model were superior to those of a competitive-suppression model for 6 of 7 subjects. In Experiment 3, a more thorough quantitative test of the modified models, fits for a direct-suppression model were superior in 11 of 13 cases. These results correspond well to those of investigations conducted with nonhumans and provide the first individual-subject evidence that a direct-suppression model, evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively, describes human punishment better than a competitive-suppression model. We discuss implications for developing better punishment models and future investigations of punishment in human choice.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Along with the dispersion of the internet, it is a common hypothesis that market transparency will improve on account of the huge amount of easily accessible information. This hypothesis neglects problems of information quality. Under certain circumstances, there are incentives for suppliers to provide false information about their products on the internet, in order to differentiate from the competitors and to increase their sales. In this paper, the theory of economics of information is applied to analyse the specific characteristics of the internet as an information medium. In particular, the authors identify three variables determining the quality of information provided on the internet: (1) the suppliers’ competitive positions, (2) the disclosure probability of false information, and (3) the customers’ loss of confidence. Subsequently, the authors use a game theoretic approach to analyse the impact of the three variables on information quality to derive insights on market transparency. © 2003 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

People who evaluate themselves as victims are expected to show a risk-seeking preference (context of innocence). People who evaluate themselves as guilty are expected to show a risk-averse preference (context of guilt). Responses of 232 participants to a decision problem were compared in four different conditions involving two-story formats (innocence/guilt) and two-question-options formats (gain/loss). Regardless of the format of the question options, the story format appears to be an important determinant of individuals' preferences.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We consider estimation of loss for generalized Bayes or pseudo-Bayes estimators of a multivariate normal mean vector, θ. In 3 and higher dimensions, the MLE X is UMVUE and minimax but is inadmissible. It is dominated by the James-Stein estimator and by many others. Johnstone (1988, On inadmissibility of some unbiased estimates of loss, Statistical Decision Theory and Related Topics, IV (eds. S. S. Gupta and J. O. Berger), Vol. 1, 361-379, Springer, New York) considered the estimation of loss for the usual estimator X and the James-Stein estimator. He found improvements over the Stein unbiased estimator of risk. In this paper, for a generalized Bayes point estimator of θ, we compare generalized Bayes estimators to unbiased estimators of loss. We find, somewhat surprisingly, that the unbiased estimator often dominates the corresponding generalized Bayes estimator of loss for priors which give minimax estimators in the original point estimation problem. In particular, we give a class of priors for which the generalized Bayes estimator of θ is admissible and minimax but for which the unbiased estimator of loss dominates the generalized Bayes estimator of loss. We also give a general inadmissibility result for a generalized Bayes estimator of loss.\u001b[0m :\n",

The statistical model is developed like as a small software version for policy-makers to evaluate critical decisions. The statistical decision making theory is used in seeking solutions to optimise the choice of governmental decisions. The functions of losses or gains are defined on the basis of statistical data in two levels - macroeconomic level and microeconomic level.

      "Abstract: The attempt to recover gambling losses by continuing to gamble ('chasing') has featured prominently in accounts of excessive gambling. This research represents the first attempt to operationalize and measure chasing in terms of its cognitive (behavioral intention), emotive (urges) and behavioral components, and to investigate the role of chasing in relation to impaired control over gambling. Two survey samples of 84 male off-course (betting shop) race gamblers (mean age 41, SD = 15) and 137 gaming machine players (73 females, mean age 48, SD = 15 and 64 males, mean age 43, SD = 16) were recruited at gambling venues. Respondents completed a structured questionnaire that investigated retrospective report of chasing and an impaired control scale (\"The Scale of Gambling Choices\"). It was found that the various components of chasing formed a composite measure with high internal reliability that was strongly related to indicators of excessive gambling (e.g. time spent gambling, expenditure as a proportion of income) and to impaired control scores. Reacting to large wins by further betting was almost as strongly related to impaired control as was persistence after losing. Those who returned later to chase had significantly higher impaired control scores than those who only chased within a session. Alcohol-related chasing was associated with impaired control over gambling. Chasing of losses and impaired control appear to be generic processes in evidence across both forms of gambling and gender (most format and sex differences were of minor significance).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Downsizing has been a recurrent theme in corporate life for the last 20 years. Literature in this area has evolved sporadically and covers many aspects of it. Although this has resulted in rich data, there is a lack of robust research that integrates the strategic and operational elements of downsizing. Furthermore, downsizing results in negative outcomes such as loss of skills, learning and innovation. It can also result in negative emotions including anger, frustration and guilt. However, there is insufficient data about the specific conditions or contextual factors that influence survivors reactions. This article presents the findings of a study conducted in four large organisations in the UK that have undergone downsizing. It proposes a theoretical model encapsulating the organisational context, and argues that the two key factors that determine the context are frequency of downsizing and the degree of control that the organisation exercises in making the decision to downsize. A broad set of propositions is presented as to the likely reactions of ‘survivors’ in the various organisational contexts of downsizing. © 2003 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Results of these investigations show that the form of exchange studied - negotiated or reciprocal - affects many of the processes and assumptions underlying contemporary theories of exchange. Three such effects are discussed here. First, the form of exchange affects the causal mechanisms underlying power use and the relation between network structure and power. Second, whether exchange is negotiated or reciprocal affects the relative emphasis on learning or rational-choice models and the breadth of motivations assumed for \"self-interested\" actors, including reward maximization, loss avoidance, and reciprocity. Third, the form of exchange affects the salience of the cooperative and competitive \"faces\" of exchange, influencing actors' subjective experiences with exchange. These results show the limitations of theories based on any single form of exchange and the need for greater understanding of the full range of exchange forms that characterize social life.\u001b[0m :\n",

We measure the effects of information about Pfiesteria on three related decision processes of the consumer: risk perceptions, seafood demand, and willingness to pay for a mandatory seafood inspection program. Using responses to a survey on seafood consumption and hypothetical Pfiesteria-related fish kills, we find that announcement of a fish kill increases the perceived risks of seafood and decreases the demand for seafood. Information policies that assure the safety of seafood have little effect in restoring consumer confidence in seafood. Perceived negative information tends to decrease welfare by more than the counter effects of perceived positive information.

      "Abstract: Economists have always argued that only when people bear true economic costs of using natural resources, such as mangroves, that they will have appropriate incentives to use them efficiently and minimize their degradation and losses. More recently, non-economists, too, have started to call for the use of economic valuation information to argue for conservation of mangroves. This paper briefly examines the role economic valuation information can play, at least theoretically, in encouraging conservation of mangroves and increasing efficiency in resource use. In practice, the paper argues that a number of difficulties are likely to be encountered when determining true economic value of mangroves, particularly when small areas of mangroves are involved. A total reliance on economic valuation-based decision-making is questioned, particularly in the light of minimal ecological information often available in small island nations in the Pacific. An alternative decision-making process is proposed in which the relevance of economic valuation-based decision-making is recognized but at a second tier level. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract: New methods were developed for studying risky decision making in children as young as age five. Each child was given a block of 'gain' trials, for example, a choice between a sure gain of one prize and a 50:50 chance of gaining either two prizes or no prize, and a block of 'loss' trials, for example, a choice between a sure Loss of one prize and a 50:50 chance of losing either two prizes or no prize. We were thus able to compare risky choice for gains and losses at the level of the individual child. In each of two experiments a variety of individual difference variables were measured, including in Experiment 2, the child's parent's scores on the same task. Across experiments, the preponderance of choices was of the risky option. However, most children and adults made more risky choices in the domain of losses than in the domain of gains. Predictors of individual differences in children included shyness, impulsivity, and the risk taking of the child's parent. We suggest that methods are now in place to encourage further studies of decision processes in young children. © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe the concerns of family caregivers of patients undergoing palliative surgeries for advanced malignancies. DESIGN: Descriptive study with repeated measures. SETTING: A National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the western United States. SAMPLE: Family caregivers (N = 45) of patients with cancer. METHODS: Family caregivers were assessed prior to planned palliative surgery and at two weeks and six weeks postsurgery. Quantitative assessment of caregiver quality of life (QOL) occurred at each interval. A subset of nine caregivers also participated in a structured interview presurgery and at two weeks postsurgery. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Caregiver concerns, QOL, decision making. FINDINGS: Family caregivers have important QOL concerns and needs for support before and after surgery for advanced disease. Psychological issues were most pronounced, and common concerns included uncertainty, fears regarding the future, and loss. Family caregivers have concerns about surgical risks and care after surgery and voiced recognition of the declining status of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is an important component of palliative care and profoundly impacts family caregivers of patients with cancer. The needs of family caregivers are multiple and complex, requiring ongoing assessment to provide interventions that help them cope and ultimately improve their QOL. This important topic requires further research and clinical attention. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Findings suggest that family caregivers experience their own trajectory during the course of their loved ones' cancer, with surgery being a part of the course. This includes their profound emotions that may swing like a pendulum from one minute to the next. Nurses need to assess family caregivers in addition to patients to provide support and resources that will help increase caregivers' QOL.\u001b[0m :\n",

We argue that MBUC responses convey subjective probabilities. We examine the decision process of the researcher faced with estimating population parameters from MBUC sample responses. We develop her optimal decision rule based on a specified loss function. The resulting estimator accommodates uncertainty on the part of the respondent and the researcher. We illustrate the proposed estimation method using MBUC responses from the first field application of this elicitation format. The resulting framework produces stable estimates and nests alternative methods of modeling MBUC responses.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present paper explores situations in which the information available to decision makers is limited to feedback concerning the outcomes of their previous decisions. The results reveal that experience in these situations can lead to deviations from maximization in the opposite direction of the deviations observed when the decisions are made based on a description of the choice problem. Experience was found to lead to a reversed common ratio/certainty effect, more risk seeking in the gain than in the loss domain, and to an underweighting of small probabilities. Only one of the examined properties of description-based decisions, loss aversion, seems to emerge robustly in these 'feedback-based' decisions. These results are summarized with a simple model that illustrates that all the unique properties of feedback-based decisions can be a product of a tendency to rely on recent outcomes.

      "Abstract: We investigated how situational (gain-loss), informational (opportunity-threat framing) and dispositional (achievement motive and avoidance motive) variables affected opportunity-threat perception and risky choice in managerial decision-making contexts. In Study 1, the risk preference of the participants showed a reflection effect due to situational differences (gain or loss) and a partial framing effect caused by presenting the same choice information in terms of either opportunities or threats. However, both effects were in the opposite direction of predictions from prospect theory. Gains and positive framing enhanced risk-seeking preference whereas losses and negative framing augmented risk-averse preference. Risk-seeking choices were mediated by opportunity perception whereas risk-averse choices were mediated by threat perception. In Study 2, the participants high in achievement motive perceived greater opportunities in a negative situation, and the participants high in avoidance motive perceived greater threats in a positive situation, suggesting that ambition (achievement motive) operates more significantly in the face of adversities whereas cautiousness (avoidance motive) functions more significantly in prosperity.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper examines the effects of mood on the behavior of traders or decision makers in financial markets. Based on a review of the psychological theories and empirical findings which relate mood to decision making and information processing, we derive hypotheses with respect to the impact of good, neutral, and bad moods on the behavior of traders. Two experiments (N = 66 and 72) were conducted on an Internet platform which simulated foreign exchange trading based on historical market data. The first experiment manipulated mood using feedback and music whereas the second one asked subjects to read mood-laden statements. It was found that traders in a good mood had an inferior trading performance (losing money) compared to those in a neutral or bad mood (making profit). This is because traders in a good mood made less accurate decisions than those in neutral or bad moods. Those in a bad mood were the most accurate in their decisions but behaved conservatively in their trading. Subjects in a good mood tended to make less accurate decisions though they spent on average at least the same time as the other subjects on information processing and decision-making. They also were over-confident taking unwarranted risks. The studies concluded with insights concerning the effects of mood on choice of trading strategies. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

      "Abstract: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are the most common utility measure in medical decision analysis and economic evaluations of health care. This paper presents an axiomatization of QALYs under cumulative prospect theory (CPT), currently the most influential model for decision under uncertainty. Because the set of health states need not be endowed with a natural topology that is connected, we first show how existing CPT characterizations can be extended to a class of outcome sets for which no connected natural topology is given. We then characterize QALY models with linear, power, and exponential utility for duration. Finally, we define loss aversion for multiattribute utility theory and characterize the QALY models under general and constant loss aversion. The measurement of QALYs belongs to the general field of multiattribute utility theory. Hence, our results can be generalized to other multiattribute decision contexts and they thereby contribute to the development of multiattribute utility theory under cumulative prospect theory.\u001b[0m :\n",

Many decisions, including nominating buying or selling prices, involve uncertainty, and we assert that people experience negative psychological reactions to uncertainty. These reactions can affect a person's valuation of the various options, biasing the person's actions towards the status quo, thus producing the endowment effect. Our model also proposes positive or negative reactions to unlikely prospects, which are able to explain commonly observed behaviour in the presence of ambiguity.\u001b[0m :\n",

A risk-assessment instrument consisting of systematically varied business scenarios was used to measure managerial perceptions of the risk dimensions of uncertainty, gains/losses, framing and personal involvement. Findings suggest that positive affect (high PA) managers viewed risk-related uncertainly and personal involvement more optimistically, but were not more willing to seek risk.

      "Abstract: Objectives. We investigate the association between an extensive set of location-specific factors and the propensity of retirement-age individuals to remain in, or relocate to, those locations. In particular we investigate whether state and local fiscal factors influence the migration decisions of retirees, and we study the relative importance of fiscal and other factors in these decisions. Methods. We place decisions regarding whether to move and where to locate in a single discrete-choice framework. We estimate an individual-level location-choice model by using a combination of place-characteristics data and Census county-to-county migration data for the period 1985-1990. Results. We find that levels of tax burdens and public services can affect location decisions. Of the fiscal variables, income taxes have the largest relative effects. However, other factors, including climate, economic conditions, and population characteristics, appear to play much larger roles in migration and location decisions. Discussion. Although income tax reductions might influence the location decisions of recent retirees, whether or not the economic benefits associated with these population gains outweigh the accompanying revenue losses is an important area for further research. A more cost-effective strategy may be for states to focus on marketing their amenities rather than using fiscal policy to recruit retirees.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Internet security is a pervasive concern for all companies. However, developing the business case to support investments in IT security has been particularly challenging because of difficulties in precisely quantifying the economic impact of a breach. Previous studies have attempted to quantify the magnitude of losses resulting from a breach in IT security, but reliance on self reported company data has resulted in widely varying estimates of limited credibility. Employing an event study methodology, this study offers an alternative approach and more rigorous evaluation of breaches in IT security. This attempt has revealed several new perspectives concerning the market reaction to IT security breaches. A final component of the study is the extension of the analysis to incorporate eSecurity vendors and a fuller exploration of market reactions before and after the denial of service attacks of February 2000. The key takeaway for corporate IT decision makers is that IT security breaches are extremely costly, and that the stock market has already factored in some level of optimal IT security investment by companies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We present a novel approach to the modeling of motor responses based on statistical decision theory. We begin with the hypothesis that subjects are ideal motion planners who choose movement trajectories to minimize expected loss. We derive predictions of the hypothesis for movement in environments where contact with specified regions carries rewards or penalties. The model predicts shifts in a subject's aiming point in response to changes in the reward and penalty structure of the environment and with changes in the subject's uncertainty in carrying out planned movements. We tested some of these predictions in an experiment where subjects were rewarded if they succeeded in touching a target region on a computer screen within a specified time limit. Near the target was a penalty region which, if touched, resulted in a penalty. We varied distance between the penalty region and the target and the cost of hitting the penalty region. Subjects shift their mean points of contact with the computer screen in response to changes in penalties and location of the penalty region relative to the target region in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the hypothesis. Thus, movement planning takes into account extrinsic costs and the subject's own motor uncertainty.\u001b[0m :\n",

The author develops a pricing model for the firm's cost of expropriation risk that includes the positions of both government and firm. The government's decision to expropriate is modeled as an American-style call option. The cost of expropriation risk is modeled as the value of an insurance policy that pays off all losses resulting from expropriation. The firm's cost of expropriation risk is determined by the government acting to optimize the value of its option to expropriate. The author identifies the parameters that link the government's option to expropriate to the firm's cost of expropriation risk, and shows how the model can be used in capital budgeting decisions and the ongoing management of expropriation risk.\u001b[0m :\n",

The participants maintained strong bonds with the deceased through the conscious decision to remember their unique qualities and through parenting their children, a tradition rooted in the history of the African American family.

      "Abstract: By one recent account, only 26% of software development projects are completed on schedule, within budget, and with the promised functionality. The remaining 74% are troubled in some way: they are either cancelled before the development cycle is completed (28%) or are delivered late, over budget, and with reduced functionality (46%), In many cases, the most cost-effective solution would be to abort the troubled project early in the cycle, but senior managers are often unaware of the project's problems. Anecdotal evidence and at least one recent study suggest that losses are sometimes increased by the reluctance of organizational members to transmit negative information concerning a project and its status. Thus, although evidence of a failing course of action may exist in the lower ranks of an organization, this information sometimes fails to be communicated up the hierarchy or is substantially distorted in the process. The result is that decision-makers with the authority to change the direction of the project are unaware of its true status. By modelling this reluctance to transmit negative project status information and improving our understanding of the phenomenon, we believe that prescriptions can be developed eventually to reduce the losses from troubled development projects. In this theory development paper, we examine the reluctance to transmit negative information and develop a theoretical model that explains this phenomenon within a software project context. The model we develop draws on literature from the fields of organizational behaviour and communications, ethics, economics, information systems and psychology, and points the direction for future research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper emphazises the adverse event categorization principle in risk acceptance analysis, and suggests the use of a standard type risk profile of lognormal type for each category of adverse events. The risk profile for a specified category of adverse events and corresponding to a given operation time is defined as the complementary probability distribution function for the accumulated loss during the operation time. The suggestion of the lognormal standard risk profile is based on the following modeling: The sequence of rare adverse events in time is mathematically modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process. It is shown that there is a specific mathematical form of the risk profiles which is robust with respect to variation of distributional assumptions for the losses associated to the single adverse events. The effect of capitalization of the future losses to present time is that the risk profile asymptotically approaches a limit risk profile as the operation time increases. This asymptotic profile is well approximated by the lognormal profile as is the profile for shorter operation time if the single losses are assumed to have lognormal distribution. The risk profile modeling is exemplified by a study of oil spills due to simulated tanker collisions in the Danish straits. It is found that the distribution of the oil spill volume per spill is well represented by an exponential distribution both in Øresund and in Great Belt. When applied in the Poisson model, a risk profile reasonably close to the standard lognormal profile is obtained. Moreover, based on data pairs (volume, cost) for world wide oil spills it is inferred that the condi-tional distribution of the costs given the spill volume is well modeled by a lognormal distribution. By unconditioning by the exponential distribution of the single oil, spill, a risk profile for the costs is obtained that is indistinguishable from the standard lognormal risk profile. Finally the question of formulating a public risk acceptance criterion is addressed following Ditlevsen, and it is argued that a Nature Preservation Willingness Index can be defined in a similar way as the so-called Life Quality Index defined by Nathwani et al. [Nathwani JS, Lind NC, Pandey MD. Affordable safety by choice: the life quality method. Institute for Risk Research, University of Waterloo; Waterloo (Ontario, Canada): 1997], and can be used to quantify the risk acceptance criterion for the pollution of the environment.

      "Abstract: People are generally reluctant to accept risk. In particular, people overvalue sure gains, relative to outcomes which are merely probable. At the same time, people are also more willing to accept bets when payoffs involve losses rather than gains. I consider how far adaptive learning can go in explaining these phenomena. I report simulations in which adaptive learners of the kind studied in Roth Erev (1995, 1998) and Borgers Sarin (1997, 2000) deal with a problem of repeated choice under risk where alternatives differ by a mean preserving spread. The simulations show that adaptive learning induces (on average) risk averse choices. This learning bias is stronger for gains than for losses. Also, risk averse choices are much more likely when one of the alternatives is a certain prospect. The implications of a learning interpretation of risk taking are explored.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many large companies operate some form of occupational health service (OHS). More companies now require specific evaluative information to justify the continued provision of an in-house OHS. This is in the face of increased pressure to control costs, combined with an awareness that the service itself can induce activity (supplier-induced demand) and could be substituted with health care provided or even funded outside the company. The lack of routinely collected data and the conceptual difficulty in defining and measuring the outcomes of an OHS provide challenges for economic evaluation. A purely human capital approach, where people are valued by their wage rates, is likely to be insufficient, since OHSs have multiple objectives. These objectives include fulfilling statutory obligations, contributing to the creation of a culture of partnership, reduction of potential costs to the company (sickness benefit, production loss, poor performance, litigation, insurance) and providing a suitable environment for the cost-effective reduction of the social and health service costs of illness at work. Evidence is needed to quantify some of these arguments and demonstrate to decision makers the value generated by OHSs. The aim of this paper is to consider the practicality of different economic evaluation methodologies, specifically cost models, contingent valuation (willingness-to-pay) and development of OHS-specific outcome measures. In considering different approaches, we present the results of our research in two UK companies.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper uses experimental methods to investigate the effort and reporting decisions of an individual subject to the risk of a monetary loss. We find that the decision to over-report the loss suffered is sensitive to the probability of obtaining compensation, as intuition suggests.

      "Abstract: Decision making in uncertain environments is a daily challenge faced by adults of all ages. Framing decision options as either gains or losses is a common method of altering decision-making behavior. In the experiment reported here, bench-mark decision-making data collected in the 1970s by Tversky and Kahneman (1981, 1988) were compared with data collected from current samples of young and older adults to determine whether behavior was consistent across time. Although differences did emerge between the benchmark and the present samples, the effect of framing on decision behavior was relatively stable. The present findings suggest that adults of all ages are susceptible to framing effects. Results also indicated that apparent age differences might be better explained by an analysis of cohort and time-of-testing effects. Actual or potential applications of this research include an understanding of how framing might influence the decision-making behavior of people of all ages in a number of applied contexts, such as product warning interactions and medical decision scenarios.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this paper we propose a logic of desires with a utilitarian semantics, in which we study nonmonotonic reasoning about desires and preferences based on the idea that desires can be understood in terms of utility losses (penalties for violations) and utility gains (rewards for fulfillments). Our logic allows for a systematic study and classification of desires, for example by distinguishing subtly different ways to add up these utility losses and gains, We propose an explicit construction of the agent's preference relation from a set of desires together with different kinds of knowledge. A set of desires extended with knowledge induces a set of 'distinguished' utility functions by adding up the utility losses and gains of the individual desires, and these distinguished utility functions induce the preference relation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: To show how epidemiological data can be presented and analysed in frequency based and risk based formats and how risk based information can simplify management decisions on injury prevention strategies in professional football. Methods: The club physiotherapists at four English professional football clubs prospectively recorded players' injuries over the period November 1994 to May 1997. The nature, location, and mechanism of each injury and the specific numbers of days that players were unavailable to train or play as a result of injuries were recorded. The rates of injury were evaluated on a risk matrix using the number of days and the estimated costs of absence as measures of injury consequences. Results: There was a significant difference in the time lost through injury as a function of injury severity (p<0.001). Slight and minor injuries accounted for 51% of all injuries but represented only 17% of the risk from injury, whereas major injuries accounted for only 12% of the number of injuries and 47% of the risk. Player to player contact injuries accounted for 39% of the risk of injury, and football specific activities accounted for 47% of the risk. The risks of acute injury in professional football were three orders of magnitude greater than those in the constructian, manufacturing, and service sectors of industry. Conclusions: The risks associated with minor, moderate, and major acute injuries and osteoarthritis in lower limb joints of professional footballers were found to be unacceptable when evaluated against work based risk criteria used by the Health and Safety Executive. All stakeholders within professional football were shown to have an important contribution to make in reducing the overall level of risk to players through the provision of risk prevention strategies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study extends previous research in ethical decision-making in marketing. Using Hunt and Vitell's [J Macromark 6 (1986) 5] model, perceived risk is operationalized as the result of insufficient time and information for decision-making where substantial magnitude and probability for loss is present. Results from a national study of sales managers indicate that risk perceptions affect the relative balance of nonconsequential and consequential evaluations in forming ethical judgments and intentions. For all subjects, nonconsequential evaluations contribute more to ethical judgments than consequential evaluations. However, structural analyses of the Hunt and Vitell model reveal that under higher risk, managers attach greater importance to nonconsequential evaluations than managers who felt less risk. Lower risk is related to greater use of consequential evaluations in the formation of ethical judgments and intentions. Finally, subjects in the high-risk treatment group exhibited significantly harsher ethical judgments and less intention to perform the ethically questionable behavior. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

A loss-framed telephonic message based on prospect theory was evaluated for the effects on mammography utilization among medically un- and under-insured women living in demographically similar rural counties in Florida. The sample consisted mostly of White women (≈89%) 50-64 years old. Experimental group participants received the loss-framed message telephonically and those in the comparison group received the \"usual telephone procedure.\" Logistic regression analyses revealed that women who received the loss-framed message were six times more likely to obtain a mammogram (OR = 6.6, P < 0.0001). The impact of the loss-framed message persisted even after adjustment for initial versus re-screen mammogram effects. This in-reach, loss-framed, minimal intervention seems to have viability and may serve as an alternative or adjunct program for encouraging women to receive mammograms. © 2002 International Society for Preventive Oncology.

      "Abstract: Based on an enquiry, risk perception among non-industrial private forest owners is described in relation to climate change and forestry hazards. Of the respondents, 11% took action to remedy the effects of climate change. Out of a given set, hazards were ranked according to each respondent's experience of recent substantial financial loss to the estate and in relation to his or her willingness to make investments aimed at risk reduction. For each hazard, the respondent assessed the risk in four classes ranging from very high to negligible risk. Six hazards were considered most problematic in all three aspects: browsing damage, falling timber prices, damage by wind, spruce bark beetle, root rot and pine weevil. A majority of the respondents claimed to take action to reduce the risk associated with at least one hazard, while 35% did not know whether they did. Excluding climate change, the need for decision support was the largest in relation to damage by wind owing to a combination of perceived high risk and a high level of ignorance in relation to whether risk-reducing measures were taken.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Banks attitude towards speculative lending is typically regarded as the result of trading-off the short-term gains from risk-taking against the risk of loss of charter value. We study the trade-off between stability and competition in a dynamic setting where charter value depends on future market competition. Promoting the takeover of failed banks by solvent institutions results in greater market concentration and larger rents for the surviving incumbents. This converts banks' speculative lending decisions into strategic substitutes, granting an additional incentive to remain solvent. Entry policy may subsequently serve to fine-tune the trade-off between competition and stability. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This research investigates the sunk-cost effect or escalation defined as the irrational tendency to choose to continue to invest money, time, or effort following unsuccessful investments. Building on previous research demonstrating a loss-sensitivity principle in sequential decision making, the hypothesis was proposed that a loss-minimization goal would lead to stronger effects of sunk outcomes (prior gains and losses) than would a gain-maximizing goal. The hypothesis was investigated in three experiments with undergraduates responding to investment decision scenarios. Although the tendency to continue investments was always larger for gain-maximizing than for loss-minimizing goal instructions, the sunk-outcome effect was stronger in the former case. However, when the decisions were personal and concerned lower stakes rather than business investments involving large amounts of money, the expected stronger effect of sunk outcomes was found for loss-minimizing goal instructions. Another finding was that the expected value was never ignored, thus suggesting that future research should focus on the joint effects of the expected value and sunk outcomes. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: In comparison between choice alternatives, judgments of \"How much better is a preferred option?\" and \"How much worse is a less preferred option?\" may differ in their magnitudes. Such discrepancies are called \"valence effects\". Previously, Yamagishi and Miyamoto (1996) observed systematic positive valence effects (\"Better\" exceeding \"Worse\") in the domain of gains and systematic negative valence effects (\"Worse\" exceeding \"Better\") in the domain of losses. The current experiments used the directions of valence effects as a tool to assess decision-maker's interpretation of choice tasks under \"framing effects\" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1986). Preferences under the framing effect switch from certain options in the domain of gains to uncertain options in the domain of losses. Two experiments showed that preferences for certain options were associated with positive valence effects, whereas preferences for uncertain options were associated with negative valence effects. Moreover, conditions wherein the framing manipulations lose the effectiveness were examined. Valence effects showed that framing effects ceased to occur when decision-makers maintained consistent domain perceptions as pertaining to gains or to losses, across the domains of gains and losses. Implications are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

The authors created, tested, and administered two forms (patient; family) of a 35-question interview to 33 participants in a longitudinal TBI study (14 women, 19 men) and 33 associated family members. Men associated ratings of QoL with numerous variables, while women's responses revealed no significant relationships shared by QoL and other variables. Women reported a poorer QoL than did men. Older patients reported a better QoL than did younger patients. Families emphasized the family relationship, emotional control, and ability to concentrate when considering overall QoL. Patients did not. The majority of patients and families expressed satisfaction with decisions made about acute treatment. QoL research is essential to illuminate best practice models.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: According to prospect theory, individuals are risk averse regarding gains but risk seeking regarding losses, implying an S-shaped value function. The S-shaped value function hypothesis is based on experiments in which subjects are asked to choose separately between alternatives with either only positive or only negative outcomes, alternatives which rarely exist in the capital market. In addition, the S-shaped findings may be biased by the \"certainty effect\" and by probability distortion. In this paper we employ the recently developed prospect stochastic dominance criterion to test the prospect theory S-shaped value function hypothesis with mixed outcomes and with no \"certainty effect.\" Assuming that subjects do not distort moderate probabilities, we strongly reject the prospect theory S-shaped value function, with at least 76-86% of the choices being inconsistent with such preferences. When possible subjective probability distortions are taken into account, we find that at least 50-66% of the choices are inconsistent with an S-shaped value function. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

      "Abstract: We formulate a multi-attribute decision model for preventive replacement of a \"magnetic sealing head\" in a soft-drink producing factory in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In case of failure of this part, the opportunity cost (for production losses) is very important, as the entire production line will be idle. We determine in a first case the replacement policy that minimizes the total expected unit cost of replacement (preventive and corrective). Next, we determine the optimal policy that maximizes the expected multi-attribute utility of the decision-maker in the factory. Four attributes are considered in the replacement problem, namely cost, quality, labor productivity, and cash flow availability. The optimal policy in each case outperforms by far the one applied in the plant, which turns out to be costly and inefficient with respect to the utility of the decision-maker.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper addresses the general issue of whether the practice of investigating human decision making in hypothetical choice situations is at all warranted, or under what conditions. A particularly relevant factor that affects the match between real decisions and hypothetical decisions is the importance of a decision's consequences. In the literature experimental gambles tend to confound the reality of the decision situation with the size of the payoffs: hypothetical decisions tend to offer large payoffs, and real decisions tend to offer only small payoffs. Using the well-known framing effect (a tendency of risk-aversion for gains and of risk-seeking for losses) we find that the framing effect depends on payoff size but hypothetical choices match real choices for small as well as large payoffs. These results appear paradoxical unless size of incentive is clearly distinguished from the reality status of decision (real versus hypothetical). Since the field lacks a general theory of when hypothetical decisions match real decisions, the discussion presents an outline for developing such a theory. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

      "Abstract: Issue: Multiple limb amputations involving at least one upper extremity are very uncommon. The amputation of both an upper and lower limb is even more uncommon. Due to the rarity of these amputations therapists are uncertain regarding the most appropriate treatment methods. While the majority of the protocols used for single limb amputations are appropriate for these multiple limb amputees, there are differences. Loss of multiple limbs creates a problem of overheating for the individual. Loss of an arm and leg results in difficulty donning the prostheses and difficulty using crutches and parallel bars during mobilization. Method: A review is given of 16 multiple limb amputees seen in our rehabilitation centre in the last 15 years. Return to work was seen in one third and was not related to the number of the amputations. A higher proportion of these multiple limb amputations occur through alcoholism or attempted suicide behaviour than occurs with either single upper limb amputations or lower limb amputations. This existing behaviour can create a management problem for the rehabilitation team during rehabilitation. Conclusion: Guidelines as to appropriate prosthetic and pre-prosthetic care are provided to assist the practitioner who has the acute and long term care of these patients. All multiple limb amputees should be referred to a specialized rehabilitation centre to discuss prosthetic options and long term rehabilitation requirements. This paper does not discuss bilateral lower limb amputations when not combined with an upper limb amputation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Most empirical studies assume only monotonic preferences for households. Behavioral research, however, provides substantial evidence that preferences for wealth are measured relative to a reference point. In this paper we introduce and solve a two-period consumption and savings model for a loss-averse agent who measures utility from consumption relative to a benchmark level. The solution is given as a parametric decision rule with one unknown parameter that depends on the distribution of the return on saving. We find non-linearity in the fraction of wealth saved, where the specific saving pattern depends on the sign of the real return on savings. The amount of saving is nondecreasing in initial wealth and the riskiness of the return distribution. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents a suggested alternative to simplistic majority voting schemes based on the value of uncertain information. It uses satellite antennae deployment as an illustrative example. Control software is used in satellites to activate system functions like, e.g. antenna deployment. The software receives observations from sensors built into satellites and uses this information to trigger required functions. Often, inadvertent activation and delayed response can have severe consequences. Hence the way in which sensor information is processed strongly influences the system performance. We discuss an approach that models various 'design' options in detail so that the software control flow can be optimised via decision theory. We give some mathematical background and an example based on the CLUSTER satellite system that was spun off a design problem at European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC). Our example considers the decision of when to deploy a satellite antenna. The control software must decide when to inspect sensors and when to deploy the antenna. We show how to optimise both the inspection time and the time to deploy the antenna given the results of the inspection. For our example it is important that the consequences of the control software decisions are analysed and measured in monetary loss associated with failure. This allows us to measure the risk in expected loss of money. Given control software designs A and B one can compare them by obtaining the value of information. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      "Abstract: Pain in the elderly is often unrecognized and undertreated. Ineffective pain management can have a significant impact on the quality of life of older adults, leading to depression, social isolation, and a loss of function. Proper assessment of older adults requires the physician to regularly ask about the presence of pain and be skillful in assessment strategies to evaluate the frequency and intensity of pain. Assessment of pain in older adults with dementia and communication disorders is especially challenging. Effective pain management in elderly patients should include both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies. Pharmacologic strategies call for administration of nonopioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and adjuvant medication. Polypharmacy, drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, age-associated changes in drug metabolism, and the high frequency of adverse drug reactions need to be carefully considered in using medications in this population. Nonpharmacologic approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, education, osteopathic manipulative treatment, and exercise should be applied in addition to pharmacologic therapy. Using a team approach and incorporating principles of pain management can effectively provide good analgesia for older adults.\u001b[0m :\n",

It argues that being poor is not the only reason why certain sectors are more vulnerable to floods or any environmental hazards - spatial isolation and lack of participation in decision making intensify their present and future vulnerability, as well. Archival research, interviews, focused group discussion, participant observation and surveys of populations at risk are employed to delineate the flood experiences and coping strategies of street children and residents of poor urban settlements and wealthy neighborhoods in Metro Manila at the household and community levels. The concept of entitlement, the Contextual Hazards Model, and the Access Model are used in the data analysis and interpretation. Several policy recommendations on hazard management and disaster mitigation are identified to reduce flood losses in Metro Manila.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper develops a model of differentiated consumers to examine the consumption effects of genetic modification (GM) under alternative labelling regimes and segregation enforcement scenarios. Analytical results show that if consumers perceive GM products as being different than their traditional counterparts, GM affects consumer welfare and, thus, consumption decisions. When the existence of market imperfections in one or more stages of the supply chain prevents the transmission of cost savings associated with the new technology to consumers, GM results in welfare losses for consumers. The analysis shows that the relative welfare ranking of the 'no labelling' and 'mandatory labelling' regimes depends on: (i) the level of consumer aversion to GM products; (ii) the size of marketing and segregation costs under mandatory labelling; (iii) the share of the GM product in total production; and (iv) the extent to which GM products are incorrectly labelled as non-GM products. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: This paper gives a new explanation for the systematic disparity between standard gamble (SG) utilities and time trade-off (TTO) utilities. The common explanation, which is based on expected utility, is that the disparity is caused by curvature of the utility function for duration. This explanation is, however, incomplete. People violate expected utility and these violations lead to biases in SG and TTO utilities. The paper analyzes the impact on SG and TTO utilities of three main reasons why people violate expected utility: probability weighting, loss aversion, and scale compatibility. In the SG, the combined effect of utility curvature, probability weighting, loss aversion, and scale compatibility is an upward bias. In the TTO these factors lead both to upward and to downward biases. This analysis can also explain the tentative empirical finding that the TTO better describes people's preferences for health than the SG. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Glaucoma is a major cause of preventable sight loss. As there are no obvious symptoms in the early stages, when it is most beneficial to start treatment, the key to reducing undiagnosed glaucoma in the community is better case finding among those at higher risk. This qualitative study aimed to identify triggers to self-referral for glaucoma symptoms in a sample from Britain, and to explore the meaning of symptoms for people living with moderate to severe glaucoma. Participants (N = 28) reported low levels of awareness of glaucoma prior to their diagnosis, and had assumed that symptoms were the 'normal' deterioration of eyesight expected with other morbidity or advancing age. As symptoms have a gradual onset, participants had learnt to cope with diminishing sight ability. However, many reported that such coping was 'at a cost', and that managing in a world designed for the well sighted caused problems for activities of everyday living, work and family life. The salience of these problems was shaped primarily by social factors, which framed both the practical consequences of sight loss and their meaning for respondents. Findings from this study suggest health promotion is a priority to increase public awareness of the existence and symptoms of glaucoma among those at high risk, and that more attention could be given to reducing the environmental and social causes of disability. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Method: A total of 67 randomly selected residents of a high-density area of Harare participated in the study. Participants were asked \"person-trade-off\" questions to determine their preferences in terms of the numbers of people of various ages who would be saved from death and from suffering a year of ill-health relative to the number of 30-year-olds who would be saved from these eventualities. Findings: The responses indicate that the value of averting year of ill-health was judged greatest for 15-year-olds and was equal for people aged 1, 30, and 45 years. The value of averting a death primarily reflected the expected-years of life lost, but the influence of age-weighting was evident in that 15 years was the most highly valued age. Conclusion: Although the age-weighting curves did not correspond exactly with the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) age-weights, Zimbabweans showed a preference for saving the lives of young adults.

      "Abstract: Objective: The authors' goal was to assess healthy individuals' attitudes toward five of the most prominent proposed safeguards regarding the consent process for research with adults unable to consent. Method: Telephone interviews were conducted with 246 individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's disease who had participated in clinical research. Results: The majority of respondents said that they were willing to participate in research if they lost the ability to consent. Few completed a research advance directive. Many had discussed their preferences with their families, and the majority would allow their families to make research decisions for them. Conclusions: Enrolling individuals who are unable to consent in research that offers no potential for medical benefit is consistent with the preferences of at least some individuals. This suggests that such research should not be prohibited, provided there is sufficient evidence that it is consistent with the preferences of individual subjects. Requiring that such evidence be provided in a formal research advance directive may be unnecessarily restrictive.

Until now the extensive research on framing effects has been characterized by static contexts, explicit probabilities, and hypothetical gambles. In contrast we simulated a more realistic decision making environment in which individuals chose more or less risky goals in a complex dynamic task that featured uncertain outcomes and meaningful consequences. Decision makers chose a series of performance goals under conditions of either potential losses or gains and also received feedback about their goal attainment. Our results failed to replicate Prospect Theory predictions about initial gain vs. loss framing typically found in static decision making contexts. In addition, we tested competing hypotheses derived from Prospect Theory and Quasi-Hedonic Editing (QHE) Theory about the effects of performance outcome feedback on subsequent decisions. Consistent with QHE Theory, decision makers who had failed to reach their goals set lower, less risky goals in subsequent decisions. Our findings illustrate the need for further risk taking research in environments that more closely resemble managerial decision making. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

      "Abstract: Animals are predominantly risk prone toward reward delays and risk averse toward reward amounts. Humans in turn tend to be risk-seeking for losses and risk averse for gains. To explain the human results, Prospect Theory postulates a convex utility for losses and concave utility for gains. In contrast, Scalar Utility Theory (SUT) explains the animal data by postulating that the cognitive representation of outcomes follows Weber's Law, namely that the spread of the distribution of expected outcomes is proportional to its mean. SUT also would explain human results if utility (even if it is linear on expected outcome) followed Weber's Law. We present an experiment that simulates losses and gains in a bird, the European Starling, to test the implication of SUT that risk proneness/aversion should extend to any aversive/desirable dimension other than time and amount of reward. Losses and gains were simulated by offering choices of fixed vs. variable outcomes with lower or higher outcomes than what the birds expected. The subjects were significantly more risk prone for losses than for gains but, against expectations, they were not significantly risk averse toward gains. The results are thus, in part, consistent with Prospect Theory and SUT and show that risk attitude in humans and birds may obey a common fundamental principle.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We report the observation of neural processing that occurs within 265 milliseconds after outcome stimuli that inform human participants about gains and losses in a gambling task. A negative-polarity event-related brain potential, probably generated by a medial-frontal region in or near the anterior cingulate cortex, was greater in amplitude when a participant's choice between two alternatives resulted in a loss than when it resulted in a gain. The sensitivity to losses was not simply a reflection of detecting an error; gains did not elicit the medial-frontal activity when the alternative choice would have yielded a greater gain, and losses elicited the activity even when the alternative choice would have yielded a greater loss. Choices made after losses were riskier and were associated with greater loss-related activity than choices made after gains. It follows that medial-frontal computations may contribute to mental states that participate in higher level decisions, including economic choices.\u001b[0m :\n",

Twenty healthy adults performed a risk-taking task during positron emission tomography with 15O-labeled water. The task, a computerized card game, tests the ability to weigh short-term rewards against long-term losses. A control task matched all components of the risk-taking task except for decision-making and the difference between responses to contingent and non-contingent reward and punishment. Decision-making (2 runs of the active task minus 2 runs of the control task) activated orbital and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, insula, inferior parietal cortex and thalamus predominantly on the right side, and cerebellum predominantly on the left side. In an exploratory analysis, guessing (run 1 minus run 2 of the active task) accompanied activation of sensory-motor associative areas, and amygdala on the left side, whereas informed decision-making (run 2 minus run 1) activated areas that subserve memory (hippocampus, posterior cingulate) and motor control (striatum, cerebellum).

The article concludes that the remedy was specifically devised for Blake’s case and will have extremely limited application. © 2002 Accounting Foundation, University of Sydney.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background. Presentation of information using survival or mortality (i.e., incidence) curves offers a potentially powerful method of communication because such curves provide information about risk over time in a relatively simple graphic format. However, the effect of framing as survival versus mortality on understanding and treatment choice is not known. Methods. In this study, 451 individuals awaiting jury duty at the Philadelphia City Courthouse were randomized to receive 1 of 3 questionnaires: (1) survival curves, (2) mortality curves, or (3) both survival and mortality curves. Each questionnaire included a brief description of a hypothetical treatment decision, survival curve graphs and/or mortality curve graphs presenting the outcome of the treatment, and questions measuring understanding of the information contained in the graphs and preference for undergoing treatment. After completing a brief practice exercise, participants were asked to answer questions assessing their ability to interpret single points on a curve and the difference between curves, and then to decide whether they would choose to undergo preventive surgery for 3 different scenarios in which the benefit of surgery varied. Results. Participants who received only survival curves or who received both survival and mortality curves were significantly more accurate in answering questions about the information than participants who received only mortality curves (P < 0.05). For 2 of the 3 treatment presentations, participants who received only mortality curves were significantly less likely to prefer preventive surgery than participants who received survival curves only or both survival and mortality curves (P < 0.05). The effect of framing on understanding was greatest among participants with less than a college education and among non-Caucasian participants. Conclusion. Framing graphic risk information as chance of death over time results in lower levels of understanding and less interest in preventive surgery than framing as chance of survival over time.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Using a sample of seventy-two firms that adopted fresh start reporting upon their emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, I test whether management estimates of fresh start equity values are misstated and whether such misstatements are related to characteristics of individual firms' bankruptcy process. I predict that the reported fresh start value reflects a tension between managerial incentives to promote the acceptance of the plan of reorganization, and incentives to enhance future reported performance. I test whether the tendency to overstate the fresh start equity value is increasing in factors affecting the acceptance of the reorganization plan (i.e., bankruptcy claimants' relative bargaining power) and decreasing in factors affecting postbankruptcy reported performance (i.e., the probability of future losses). I find that, relative to the market value of equity immediately after emergence from Chapter 11, the fresh start equity value is, on average, understated by about 4%. The difference between the fresh start equity value and market value also exhibits significant cross-sectional variation (an average absolute error of 11 %). Consistent with my first prediction, the misstatement is increasing in the relative bargaining power of junior claimants. In contrast to my second prediction, the misstatement is also increasing in the likelihood of future reported losses. This result suggests that firms that are more likely to experience postbankruptcy financial distress are more concerned with obtaining acceptance for their plan than with the effects of the fresh start equity value on postbankruptcy performance. Finally, I document that the misstatement in the fresh start equity value is negatively related to whether firms have undergone prepackaged bankruptcies, and positively related to replacement of a prebankruptcy CEO. © 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper is about the relationship between management decisions and accounting information. Management decisions have consequences in different functional areas, departments, and different companies along the value chain. Accounting information regarding decisions aims to translate as many as possible of the diverse consequences of a decision alternative into a single financial unit of measure. This makes such information both powerful and weak: various sources of information are integrated to allow trade-offs, but operational richness gets lost in the translation. The research is based on case studies and identifies situations in which managers find accounting information useful to support decision-making: (1) when they must make a significant, new or rarely taken decision, (2) when they must take new considerations into account, and (3) when operational knowledge is distributed across various people from different parts of the organization. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      "Abstract: This reading applies rational choice theory to model aspects of persuasion in the book of Revelation. The apocalypse of John attempts to modify behavioural incentives such that Christian believers rationally choose faithful witness to God over compromise with pagan religion, despite the possible suffering that faithfulness may entail. This is achieved by attempting to persuade the congregations that the sum of the present costs and the expected eschatological losses from idolatry outweigh the current consumption benefits. Four incentive mechanisms are identified which operate on (1) preferences for idolatry and its psychological payoff; (2) the expected costs of faithfulness; (3) beliefs regarding the eschatological risks of idol worship; and (4) the discount rate applied to eschatological outcomes. © 2002, The Continuum Publishing Group Ltd.

      "Abstract: In economics, normative utility theories of decision-making under risk use a single number (expected value) to index subjective utility at the cost of losing information about risk distribution. This paper examines how people make use of risk distributions (that is, variations in expected payoffs) to maximize the probability of reaching a goal and to minimize the likelihood of falling below a minimum requirement (MR). The author proposes and tests a Bounded Risk Distribution model using both hypothetical life-death problems and real reproductive and parental decision problems. Study 1 demonstrated that a given degree of increase in expected number of saved lives had a significant effect on the respondents' risk preference when the increase was likely to cross the average MR of the respondents (in a small group context), but the same increase in expected value had little effect when the change was within a range below the average MR (in a kinship context) or above the MR (in a large group context). Study 2 examined alternative hypotheses for hypothetical risk acceptance with respect to kinship groups and found that whether the decision-maker was responsible or not had little effect on the setting of the MR and risk preference. The MR setting was mainly determined by the kinship context itself and was further fine-tuned by the framing of the choice outcomes. Study 3 was conducted in four rural villages in northwest China, and assessed real reproductive decisions. Interbirth intervals but not breast-feeding duration varied with a family's wealth, the sex of a child, and the perceived resemblance of a child to a parent. These results are interpreted in terms of the same Bounded Risk Distribution model that was applied in the hypothetical scenario studies. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVES - Obesity is a common condition in type 2 diabetic patients. Treating obesity may enhance hypoglycemic treatment and contribute to the reduction of long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications. Orlistat reduces cardiovascular risk factors in obese type 2 diabetic patients. The objectives of this study were to estimate the long-term clinical consequences of this weight loss and the resulting cost-effectiveness of treating obese type 2 diabetic patients with orlistat. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A Markov model was developed to predict, over a 10-year period, the complication rates and mortality with and without a 2-year orlistat treatment, assuming a 5-year catch-up period after treatment. A stepwise approach was used to obtain the clinical data. First, the impact of weight loss with orlistat on HbA 1c, blood pressure, and cholesterol was assessed; then, the impact on mortality and micro- and macrovascular complications of decreasing these risk factors was applied. Four subgroups were studied based on the presence of risk factors. RESULTS - Cost-effectiveness varies between 3,462 Euro/life-year gained (LYG) for obese diabetic patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and 19,986 Euro/LYG for obese diabetic patients without other risk factors. The latter result is not robust according to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS - Our results suggest that orlistat is cost-effective in the management of obese type 2 diabetic patients, especially in those with the presence of hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertension. Evidence on longer-term benefits of orlistat (>2 years) will be of importance for future decision-making.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Theory predicts that auditor reporting behaviour may be influenced by the perceived consequences of disclosing going-concern uncertainty in the audit report (DeAngelo 1981, Watts and Zimmerman 1986). Krishnan and Krishnan (1996) and Louwers (1998) have addressed this issue empirically in a US context. The results of Krishnan and Krishnan (1996) suggested that one of the important factors in the auditor's opinion decision is the risk of litigation. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between auditor economic incentives and the propensity to issue going-concern opinions in a limited litigious business environment, Belgium. In spite of the low risk of litigation and the fact that most Belgian companies are privately held, various regulations have been put into effect to safeguard audit quality in Belgium. However, the results suggest that the auditor's going-concern opinion decision in Belgium is associated with factors relating to the perceived consequences of disclosing a going-concern opinion. Specifically, the results suggest that auditors in Belgium are significantly less likely to issue going-concern opinions to clients that pay higher audit fees, and when the audit firm has lost a relatively high proportion of its clients in the preceding year. The auditor's going-concem opinion does not appear to be significantly influenced by the length of the auditor-client relationship, year of the auditor engagement period, and auditor type. The results of this study are to some extent different from the study by Louwers (1998), in which none of the incentive variables related to the auditor's loss function was significant.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper purports to estimate the characteristics of women who had experiences of abortion in 1991 based on an economic model of fertility. The study makes use of a national survey on the knowledge of, attitude towards, and practice of family planning and reproductive health among married women in Taiwan. The results show that older women with higher family income and who live in urban areas were more likely to have the pregnancy terminated. In addition, the decision to have an abortion was negatively correlated with prior pregnancy loss, but positively associated with the number of previous live births. On the other hand, the availability of abortion services as measured by the number of legal abortion providers at city and county levels had a negative effect on the demand for abortions. The local female unemployment rate was found to be positively correlated with the woman's decision to have an abortion.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Women who are at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer because of their family history are encouraged to make decisions about the medical management of their cancer risk. Using data collected during interviews with 49 high-risk premenopausal women, this article looks at some of the influences on women's risk-management choices. When describing their attitudes about preventative ovarian surgery, high-risk women draw upon discourses of control. Prophylactic surgery is constructed as both providing women with the means to gain control over their bodies, and as leading to a loss of control. More specifically, women perceive the removal of at-risk organs as both securing and undermining their present and future self-identities. Thus, it is argued that women's willingness to undergo prophylactic ovarian surgery is dependent upon them negotiating various competing risks to self and body that are associated with this risk-management option.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the significant progress in multiagent teamwork, existing research does not address the optimality of its prescriptions nor the complexity of the teamwork problem. Without a characterization of the optimality-complexity tradeoffs, it is impossible to determine whether the assumptions and approximations made by a particular theory gain enough efficiency to justify the losses in overall performance. To provide a tool for use by multiagent researchers in evaluating this tradeoff, we present a unified framework, the COMmunicative Multiagent Team Decision Problem (COM-MTDP). The COM-MTDP model combines and extends existing multiagent theories, such as decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes and economic team theory. In addition to their generality of representation, COM-MTDPs also support the analysis of both the optimality of team performance and the computational complexity of the agents' decision problem. In analyzing complexity, we present a breakdown of the computational complexity of constructing optimal teams under various classes of problem domains, along the dimensions of observability and communication cost. In analyzing optimality, we exploit the COM-MTDP's ability to encode existing teamwork theories and models to encode two instantiations of joint intentions theory taken from the literature. Furthermore, the COM-MTDP model provides a basis for the development of novel team coordination algorithms. We derive a domain-independent criterion for optimal communication and provide a comparative analysis of the two joint intentions instantiations with respect to this optimal policy. We have implemented a reusable, domain-independent software package based on COM-MTDPs to analyze teamwork coordination strategies, and we demonstrate its use by encoding and evaluating the two joint intentions strategies within an example domain. © 2002 AI Access Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers.

      "Abstract: The time-to-market in the presence of a window of opportunity is analyzed usinga probabilistic model, i.e. a model where the completion time of new product development is a random variable characterized by a gamma distribution. Two cases are considered: the first, a case where the discounted return-on-investment exceeds the return expected from a conservative investment—e.g. investment in bonds—termed ‘the profitable case’; and the second, a case where the discounted return-on-investment just balances the cost of new product development, termed ‘the salvageable case’. The model constructed is focused on the financial aspects of new product development. It allows a decision-maker to monitor, as well as terminate, a project based on its expected value (at any time prior to completion) by computing the mean time-to-market that provides profit, investment salvage, or loss. The mean time-to-market computed by the model may be compared with that estimated by the technology development team for decision-making purposes. Finally, in the presence of a window of opportunity and for the specific cases analyzed, we recommend to always keep the expenditure rate lower than the expected return rate. This will provide the decision-maker a salvageable exit opportunity if project termination is decided. Copyright. © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this study we examine whether managers' affective reactions influence their risk-taking tendencies in capital budgeting decisions. Prior research on risky decision making indicates that decision makers are often risk averse when choosing among alternatives that yield potential gains, and risk taking when the alternatives yield losses. The results reported here indicate that negative or positive affective reactions can change this commonly found risky behavior. Managers were generally risk avoiding (taking) for gains (losses) in the absence of affective reactions, as predicted by prospect theory. However, when affect was present, they tended to reject investment alternatives that elicited negative affect and accept alternatives that elicited positive affect, resulting in risk taking (avoiding) in gain (loss) contexts. The results also indicate that affective reactions can influence managers to choose alternatives with lower economic value, suggesting that managers consider both financial data and affective reactions when evaluating the utility of a decision alternative. These findings point to the importance of considering affective reactions when attempting to understand and predict risky decision making in accounting contexts.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We discuss firstly the problem of military decision, in the context of the more general development of ideas in the representation of decision making. Within this context, we have considered a mathematical model - Bayesian Decision - of decision making and military command. Previous work has been extended, and applied to this problem. A distribution of belief in outcome, given that a decision is made, and a Loss function - a measure of the effect of this outcome relative to a goal - are formed. The Bayes' Decision is the decision which globally minimises the resultant bimodal (or worse) Expected Loss function. The set of all minimising decisions corresponds to the surface to the surface of an elementary Catastrophe. This allows smooth parameter changes to lead to a discontinuous change in the Bayes' decision. In future work this approach will be used to help develop a number of hypotheses concerning command processes and military headquarters structure. It will also be used to help capture such command and control processes in simulation modelling of future defence capability and force structure.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Investors have a proven general reluctance to realize losses. The theory of \"mental accounting\" suggests that losses are easier to accept when mentally integrated with either preceding losses or with compensatory gains. Mental integration is made easier when a failed asset is exchanged against a new, apparently profitable, acqusition. The alternative is to sell the existing asset on the open market before re-investing the proceeds as desired. This is emotionally less appealing than \"rolling over\" a losing investment into a new venture by way of an asset trade. The psychological benefits of exchanging rather than selling a failed asset come at a cost. It is typical of trade-in arrangements, e.g., where one trades an old car against a new one, that the effective sale price of the existing asset is less than current market value. Accepance of this low price adds to the investor's total monetary loss on the existing asset but is essential to an overall package deal apart from which that asset would often remain belatedly unsold.\u001b[0m :\n",

To address one facet of this issue, this paper advances the proposition that decision domain and perceived outcome control interact to impact managers' new-product introduction decisions. Employing a causal method, a nested experimental design and indicators of risk's probability of loss and magnitude of loss elements, the study's results demonstrate that the manager's level of perceived outcome control combines with decision domain to determine subsequent levels of risk taking that are specific to each element of risk. Implications for theory, including prospect theory, and practice, especially firms wanting to pursue today's high-risk new-economy based initiatives, are discussed.

We show that the newsvendor problem with observable lost sales reduces to a sequence of single-period problems, while the newsvendor problem with unobservable lost sales requires a dynamic analysis. Using a Bayesian Markov decision process approach we show that the optimal inventory level in the presence of censored demand is higher than would be determined using a Bayesian myopic policy.

      "Abstract: Economic forces shape the behavior of individuals and institutions. Forces affecting individual behavior are attitudes about payoffs (gains and losses) and beliefs about outcomes (risk and ambiguity). Under risk, the likelihoods of alternative outcomes are fully known. Under ambiguity, these likelihoods are unknown. In our experiment, payoffs and outcomes were manipulated independently during a classical choice task as brain activity was measured with positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we show that attitudes about payoffs and beliefs about the likelihood of outcomes exhibit interaction effects both behaviorally and neurally. Participants are risk averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses; they are ambiguity-seeking in neither gains nor losses. Two neural substrates for choice surfaced in the interaction between attitudes and beliefs: a dorsomedial neocortical system and a ventromedial system. This finding reveals that the brain does not honor a prevalent assumption of economics-the independence of the evaluations of payoffs and outcomes. The demonstration of a relationship between brain activity and observed economic choice attests to the feasibility of a neuroeconomic decision science.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The guessing of answers in multiple choice tests adds random error to the variance of the test scores, lowering their reliability. Formula scoring rules that penalize for wrong guesses are frequently used to solve this problem. This paper uses prospect theory to analyze scoring rules from a decision-making perspective and focuses on the effects of framing on the tendency to guess. In three experiments participants were presented with hypothetical test situations and were asked to indicate the degree of certainty that they thought was required for them to answer a question. In accordance with the framing hypothesis, participants tended to guess more when they anticipated a low grade and therefore considered themselves to be in the loss domain, or when the scoring rule caused the situation to be framed as entailing potential losses. The last experiment replicated these results with a task that resembles an actual test. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Public concern about the alarmingly high rate of biodiversity loss has not been matched by public willingness to bear boundless costs to stem the tide of extinction. Because resources for conservation are limited, setting conservation priorities to use those resources effectively is crucial. To do so in a way that addresses people's most pressing concerns about biodiversity loss, managers and policy makers must understand those concerns. This study investigates preferences for an array of benefits associated with biodiversity and wildlife and the relative importance to people of each. A survey was administered to a sample of the US population to explore public preferences for types of benefits often associated with biodiversity: utilitarian (commodity and recreation), ecological (certain and uncertain), aesthetic, symbolic, and humanistic. Respondents were asked to rank hypothetical species presented in choice sets of three species, each described simply in terms of one type of benefit. A rank-ordered multinomial logit model was estimated to establish a ranking of the benefits and evaluate the sensitivity of the ranking to socio-demographic variables. The means of the sample predictions indicated the relative importance of each type of benefit. Confidence intervals were constructed to evaluate the extent to which the ranks could be distinguished from one another. Ecological functions were most important to survey respondents; commodity-based benefits and human attributes were of moderate importance; and recreation, aesthetics, and symbolic references in literature and art appeared to be least important.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article empirically examines, in a new-product decision context, the relationships among risk propensity, perceived risk, and risky choice decisions, when risk is operationalized as the chance of loss and the size of loss. The results indicate that perceptions of chance of loss directly influence choice among alternatives possessing different chances of loss and gain, whereas risk propensity directly influences choice among alternatives that differ in their size of loss and gain. The findings extend previous research by identifying dimension-specific effects (a) between who the decision maker is and the size of an investment's potential loss, and (b) between what the decision maker sees and the chance that an investment will experience a loss. These results not only contribute to theory, but also provide marketing managers with guidance for their risky choice decisions. The composition of a new product's risk has implications for the decisions marketing managers make, for the placement of managers in risk-sensitive positions, and for the presentation of information to individuals with oversight responsibility for the firm's product strategy decisions. ©2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People are frequently exposed to potentially attractive events that are subsequently and unexpectedly reversed and to potentially painful events, which are also unexpectedly reversed. In the process of being returned to the initial asset position, does the sequence in which the positive and negative events occur matter? This issue of the combined effect of pleasurable and painful stimuli has received scant theoretical or empirical attention. We attempt to fill this lacuna in the literature by studying the retrospective evaluation of surprises that return individuals to their original economic state. Although such surprises do not change an individual's original economic state, we argue that the individual's psychological state changes, and the final affective state is, among other things, a function of the sequence in which the events occur. From a theoretical standpoint, several perspectives can be brought to bear on the issue. For instance, one reading of mental accounting, based on prospect theory's value function, would predict that losses should dominate gains, and therefore, regardless of sequence, people should be unhappy when exposed to two economically equivalent outcomes of different signs. Conversely, the literature on intertemporal choice would suggest that a series that ends on an up note is preferred to a series that ends on a down note, because people like to defer gratification so that they may savor positive outcomes. Similarly, people apparently have a preference for \"happy endings.\" Finally, the extant literature on \"recency effects\" would predict that the last event in a series should have a disproportionate influence on overall affect. Our model relies on a shift in the reference point to explain how a surprising reversal of an event will lead to a nonzero evaluation of the sequence. We suggest that people's reference points shift immediately but imperfectly after a stimulus is presented. Intuitively, this implies that the first stimulus will shift the reference point in its direction, as a result of which the evaluation of a sequence of events in which an initial event is unexpectedly reversed will be more favorable if the first event is a loss than if it is a gain. This model captures the unanticipated nature of the second event (i.e., the surprise element) by allowing the first event to move the reference point. Consequently, by the time the next event occurs the reference point has been updated, as a result of which the zero economic outcome of the sequence yields nonzero utility. We further posit that the magnitude of the reference point shift should be affected by the time elapsed between the two stimuli. Specifically, the reference point shifts gradually with time, until it is fully updated. Consequently, the final affective state of the sequence is also a function of the temporal distance between the two events. The main predictions of the model were empirically supported first in a survey using a mall-intercept sample. Subsequently, we conducted a study of student subjects involving a coin-tossing game in which real money was at stake and in which subjects in one condition experienced the second outcome after a two-day delay. Our results from this second study supported the model's prediction regarding the impact of the elapsed time between the events. The experimental tasks involved surprising reversals of initial outcomes, thus ensuring that \"savoring/dread\" types of explanations (which require that subjects anticipate the second event) could not be operating. Finally, in a series of three follow-up studies, we tested the claim that the magnitude of outcomes would have an impact on observed affect, and consistent with our theory and contrary to recency predictions, we observed similar results across different magnitudes. While theoretically interesting, we should also note that our research is of potential pragmatic significance. People's reactions to a series of events is of considerable interest to marketers desirous of generating enhanced attitude, affect, purchase intention, and the like without offering economic inducements such as rebates, coupons, or other costly discounts. Additionally, public policy officials may be interested in protecting people from being manipulated into purchasing a product simply because of changes in the sequence in which a series of offers is made by the merchant.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: On a decision-making instrument known as the “gambling task” (GT), a subgroup of substance dependent individuals (SDI) opted for choices that yield high immediate gains in spite of higher future losses. This resembles the behavior of patients with ventromedial (VM) prefrontal cortex lesions. In this study, we addressed the possibility that hypersensitivity to reward may account for the “myopia” for the future in this subgroup of SDI. We used a variant version of the GT, in which the good decks yielded high immediate punishment but higher delayed reward. The bad decks yielded low immediate punishment and lower delayed reward. We measured the skin conductance response (SCR) of subjects after receiving reward (reward SCR) and during their pondering from which deck to choose (anticipatory SCR). A subgroup of SDI who was not impaired on the original GT performed normally on the variant GT. The subgroup of SDI who was impaired on the original GT showed two levels of performance on the variant GT. One subgroup (36% of the sample) performed poorly on the variant GT, and showed similar behavioral and physiological impairments to VM patients. The other subgroup of SDI (64% of the sample) performed normally on the variant task, but had abnormally large physiological responses to reward, i.e. large SCR after receiving reward (reward SCR) and large SCR in anticipation of outcomes that yield large reward. Thus, the combined cognitive and physiological approach of assessing decision-making characterizes three sub-populations of SDI. One sub-population is without impairments that can be detected by any measure of the GT paradigm. Another sub-population is similar to VM patients in that they are insensitive to the future, both positive and negative. A third sub-population is hypersensitive to reward, so that the presence or the prospect of receiving, reward dominates their behavior. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      "Abstract: One of the more disturbing yet important findings in the social sciences is the observation that alternative tasks result in different expressed preferences among choice alternatives. We examine this problem not from the perspective of an individual making personal decisions, but from the perspective of an agent trying to follow the known values of a principal. In two studies, we train people to evaluate outcomes described by specific attributes and them examine their ability to express these known values with three common tasks: ratings of individual alternatives, choices among triples of alternatives, and matching pairs of alternatives to indifference. We find that each preference assessment method has distinct strengths and weaknesses. Ratings are quick, robust at following known values, and are perceived as an easy task by respondents. However, because ratings require projection to an imprecise response scale, respondents have difficulty when applying them to more complex preference structures. Further, they place too much weight on negative information, a result that is consistent with reference-dependent loss aversion. Choice is perceived as the most realistic task and the one about which people feel the most confident. However, choices exhibit the most negativity, which, in addition to flowing from the same perceptual bias of ratings, may be exacerbated by a screening strategy that excludes alternatives possessing the lowest level of an attribute. Finally, the matching task takes the most time and is perceived to be the most difficult. It shows minimal biases, except for one glaring flaw, a substantial overweighting of the matching variable. This bias is consistent with a well-known compatibility bias and suggests that agents can learn to use a matching task appropriately for all attributes except the matching variable itself. The article concludes with a discussion of the theoretical mechanisms by which these biases infiltrate different elicitation modes and a summary of managerial implications of these results. © 2001 Elsevier Science.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Both anecdotal evidence and recently reported research suggest that people are risk-averse when faced with waiting time decisions. Four studies investigate whether there is a self-other discrepancy in how people make waiting time decisions themselves and how they predict others will make similar decisions. People are found to believe that others have valuations of time similar to their own. However, when faced with alternatives that involve risk in the duration of the wait, the results point to a self-other discrepancy, in that people report greater risk-aversion themselves than they think others would. Further, when faced with waiting time gains, people are themselves more risk-averse than they think others would be. Conversely, when faced with waiting time losses, people are themselves more risk-seeking than they think others would be. Overall, the results are consistent with the recently proposed risk-as-feelings hypothesis. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: How can firms develop a competitive defense strategy that minimizes both the self-and competitor-inflicted damages of price competition? Before acting to defend market share or initiate price cuts, managers must anticipate the long-term strategic consequences and weigh them against the short-term benefits. A pricing decision should never be made simply to make the next sale or meet some short-term sales objective, but to enhance the firm's long-term ability to operate profitably. Pricing is like playing chess. Those who make moves one at a time-seeking to minimize immediate losses or exploit immediate opportunities-will invariably be beaten by those who envision the game a few moves ahead.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We present results from two experiments on the relative importance of, and subjects' differential sensitivity to, vagueness on both probabilities and outcomes. Subjects in these studies made certainty equivalent (CE) judgments for precise and vague gambles. In the first study subjects responded to gain gambles only; in the second they judged both gain and loss gambles. Model-free analyses of the results indicate (a) a higher concern for the precision of the outcomes than that of the probabilities, (b) vagueness seeking for positive outcomes and (c) vagueness avoidance for negative outcomes and (d) no strong modal attitude toward vagueness on the probability dimension. The greater salience of the outcomes can be explained by the nature of the response mode (CEs). The reflection of attitudes towards outcome vagueness in the two domains can be explained by the distinct goals of the DMs in the two cases, which cause them to focus on the highest (most desirable) possible gain or the largest (most dreaded) conceivable loss. We propose and fit a new model of decision making with vaguely specified attributes that generalize the Prospect Theory model for the precise case. The new generalized model combines the two submodels (preference among precise lotteries and effects of vagueness) and allows estimation of the vagueness parameters. These estimated parameters are consistent with, and confirm, the patterns uncovered by the qualitative analysis. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

The agent will fail to reveal his own information and will follow the actions of his predecessor and, as a result, useful information is lost, which might have highlighted a better choice for later decision-makers. This paper evaluates the strategy of forcing a subset of agents to make their decision early from the perspective of a social planner, and a firm with a valuable or valueless product. Promotional activity by firms can be explained as an attempt to overcome the herd externality and maximize sales.

      "Abstract: Previous research has demonstrated that intuitive perceptions of certainty regarding a focal outcome are sensitive to variations in how evidence supporting nonfocal alternatives is distributed, even when such variations have no bearing on objective probability. We investigated this alternative-outcomes effect in a learning paradigm in which participants made likelihood judgments on the basis of their memory for past observations of relevant outcomes. In Experiment 1, a manipulation of evidence (observed frequencies) across alternative outcomes influenced not only intuitive certainty estimates about a focal outcome but also numeric subjective probabilities. Experiment 2 ruled out the possibility that these effects were attributable to the influence of information loss on frequency estimations. The findings were consistent with the heuristic comparison account, which suggests that the judged likelihood of a focal outcome will be disproportionately influenced by the strength (frequency) of the strongest alternative outcome.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives. This study explored whether previously reported declines in severe cognitive impairment were robust to cumulative effects of potentially confounding survey design issues. Methods. Using the 1993 Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old study (n = 7,443) and 1998 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS; n = 7,624) the proportion of persons ages 70 and older with severe cognitive impairment was calculated under various assumptions about item nonresponse, differential loss to follow-up, and the size and composition of the nursing home population. Impairment was measured for self-respondents using a modified version of the Telephone Interview Cognitive Screen; for proxy respondents ratings of memory and judgment were used. Chi-square tests were adjusted to account for complex survey designs. Results. Ignoring loss to follow-up, excluding nursing home residents, and assigning a low score to those refusing subscales yielded a statistically significant decline in severe cognitive impairment from 5.8% in 1993 to 3.8% in 1998, or an average annual decline of 6.9%. When cumulative effects of survey design issues were considered and design effects incorporated into statistical tests, statistically significant declines persisted, albeit at a reduced average annual rate, ranging from 2.5% to 6.9% per year. Discussion. Previously reported improvements in severe cognitive impairment appear to be robust to a variety of specifications. Replication with future waves of the HRS and other data is warranted.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Information ambiguity is prevalent in organizations and likely influences management decisions. This study examines, given imprecise probabilities and outcomes, how managers make choices when they are provided with single figure benchmarks. Seventy-nine MBA students completed two experiments. We found that, in a decision framed as a decision under certainty involving an ambiguous outcome, the majority of the subjects were ambiguity prone in the loss condition and switched to ambiguity aversion in the gain condition. However, in the presence of probabilistic ambiguity in a decision under risk, this expected switching pattern was shown only when the difference in riskiness between the two choice options (in the loss condition) was perceived to be relatively small. In a companion study, we used a written protocol approach to identify factors that affect decision makers' investment choices when faced with ambiguous outcomes. Protocols frequently mentioned that the ambiguous outcome option was risky, even in the case which was framed as a decision under certainty in the problem statement. In a decision under risk with ambiguous outcomes, the combination of probabilistic risk and outcome ambiguity was seen as even more risky.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: To describe the frequency and circumstances of falls among a community sample of people with stroke and to compare characteristics of fallers and nonfallers. Design: Cross-sectional, observational study. Setting: Community. Participants: Forty-one community-dwelling people with stroke (26 men, 15 women; mean age, 69.7 ± 11.6y), of which 23 had right-hemisphere infarction, 16 left-hemisphere infarction, and 2 had a brainstem lesion. Time since onset of stroke ranged from 3 to 288 months (mean, 50mo). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Standardized tests were used to measure mobility, upper limb function, activities of daily living (ADL ability), and mood. Information about fall events was collected by using a questionnaire. Results: Twenty-one participants (50%) were classed as fallers, of whom 10 had fallen repeatedly. No significant differences were found between fallers and nonfallers on any of the measures used. However, those who had 2 or more falls (n = 10) had significantly reduced arm function (P = .018) and ADL ability (P = .010), compared with those who had not fallen or experienced near falls (n = 5). Loss of balance, misjudgment, and foot dragging during walking, turning, and sit to stand were reported by fallers as the suspected causes and activities leading to falls. Conclusions: The high risk of falling among people with stroke was evident in this community-based sample. Repeat fallers had greater mobility deficits and significantly reduced arm function and ADL ability than those who did not report any instability. © 2002 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.\u001b[0m :\n",

Our findings are based on confidential Internal Revenue Service audit data and financial statement footnotes for 100 large industrial firms from 1987 to 1995. Descriptive statistics indicate that these firms often fail to disclose IRS claims for tax deficiencies that exceed a 5-percent-of-income rule of thumb. We find that the probability of disclosure increases in the relative amount of the claim or the expected loss, although the largest claims drive this result. Our evidence is consistent with firms using a stable measure of size, such as assets or normal income, to gauge materiality, rather than relying only on current period reported income. We also find that the amount accrued for the contingent liability increases in the amount of the expected loss. However, our inferences may not generalize beyond a population of large, frequently audited firms.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: To model the economic impact of introducing an occupational vaccination programme for influenza with an inactivated influenza subunit vaccine (Influvac®) in the UK. Design and setting: Using published sources, a decision tree was constructed which modelled the costs and benefits of introducing an influenza vaccine in a business in the UK from the perspective of an employer. Study participants and interventions: The model considered the implementation of an occupational vaccination programme with Influvac® in a business employing 1000 normal healthy adults earning the national average wage in the UK. The model assumed that 95% of employees would be absent from work after contracting influenza for a mean of 5 days and that the level of productivity would be reduced by 60% for one day by 85% of sick employees returning to work. Main outcome measures and results: The expected probability of an employee being absent from work following an influenza vaccination would be reduced from 5.7 to 1.8% when the incidence of influenza in the community is 6%. Accordingly, if all 1000 employees were vaccinated, a business would be expected to reduce absenteeism from work attributable to an influenza outbreak by 220 days. Moreover, the expected return on every pound invested by an employer would be £1.03, £3.09 and £5.15 (2000 values) when the annual incidence of influenza in the community is 2, 6 and 10%, respectively. Conclusions: Implementation of an occupational vaccination programme with Influvac® would be expected to reduce the incidence of influenza among a workforce leading to less absenteeism from work and averted lost productivity. Even if the incidence of influenza was as low as 2% it may be a worthwhile investment for UK employers to vaccinate their employees with Influvac®.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background The effects of traumatic brain injury on family dynamics and finances have not been extensively studied. We designed a 30-item survey to determine the effects of the injury on the child, parent(s), and siblings, and whether parents were retrospectively content with the decisions related to aggressiveness of care. Methods A questionnaire written on a sixth-grade reading level was mailed to 46 families of children who survived a traumatic brain injury resulting in an initial Glasgow Coma Scale score ≤ 7. This is a descriptive study without statistical analysis. Human Studies Committee review and informed consent were obtained. Results Thirty-two of 46 (69.6%) surveys were completed by mail or telephone. Mean patient age at time of injury was 8.7 years, mean time since injury was 3 years, and mean Glasgow Coma Scale score was 3.7. Approximately one third of children have disabilities related to education, socialization, and/or self-care skills; require multiple health care visits each month; and require prescription medications. Over one third of families were impacted in a moderate to profoundly negative way; 30% of families reported a deterioration in finances or loss of job; and 16% reported a worsening of adult relationships. In 13 of 32 cases, modification of current housing or new housing was required to facilitate home care. Siblings were adversely affected in approximately 16 of 28 families, exhibiting behavioral problems, increased fear, and withdrawal from the injured child. Only 1 of 32 families stated that they would have considered less aggressive treatment, even if it led to the child’s death. Conclusion Traumatic brain injury of a child had a negative impact on family dynamics and/or sibling behavior in more than one third of families. Despite this, most families would not limit or withdraw care if they could reconsider decisions regarding treatment.

      "Abstract: It is well accepted that conventional NPV criterion fails to capture investment flexibility, and the market approach using riskless-arbitrage-pricing is ideally suited to price real options. However, when valuing complex real options, it is difficult to satisfy the restrictive assumptions required for risk-free arbitrage pricing. Using two-action linear payoff analysis, we show that when it is possible to delay and obtain additional information, an irreversible capital investment decision should be valued as an option taking into considering the value of flexibility. This option value is not based on risk-less arbitrage, but on a more fundamental concept in decision theory - the opportunity loss criterion. Our approach relates to the Quasi-Option concept of Arrow and Fisher (1974) and Henry (1974) that considers the value of gaining more information before making irreversible environment decisions. Lund (1991) provides an excellent analysis of the relationship between the Arrow and Fisher's [1] Quasi-Option Value and Black and Schole's Market based Model [4], and suggests using both ideas for valuing real options. Conrad (1980), Fisher and Hanemann (1987) and Hanemann (1989) discuss the relationship between Quasi-Option Value and Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVP!) with respect to environmental decisions. We extend the opportunity loss concept to value real options and analyze its relationship to EVPI. We show that the value of a quasi-real option is equal to value of information. In the special case where a lognormal terminal distribution is assumed, we show that the EVPI is equivalent to the Black and. Scholes model. We demonstrate how EVPI can be used to make investment decisions under uncertainty within an options framework. The suggested approach allows revision of option values sequentially using Bayesian methods at each decision point within the well-known decision theory framework. Financial economists have not considered the intersection between Bayesian decision framework and value of investment flexibility, that allow for a less restrictive set of assumptions.\u001b[0m :\n",

A sample of 137 older women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer between 1994 and 1996 were interviewed within 2 months of diagnosis to determine demographic characteristics, their attitudes about breast cancer treatments, and which surgical treatment their surgeon initially recommended. The treatment preferences of the 35 surgeons treating these women were ascertained by asking them what treatment they would usually recommend to a hypothetical 75-year-old woman with early stage breast cancer. Patients who reported their feelings about losing a breast as 'very important' were less likely to be recommended mastectomy (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.39; 95% (Confidence Interval) CI 0.16, 0.94), while patients who reported fear of dying from breast cancer as 'very important' were more likely to be recommended mastectomy (OR = 4.60; 95% CI 1.94, 11.59), after adjusting for surgeons' age and the surgeons' treatment preference when presented with a hypothetical patient. It is concluded that surgeons integrate patients' attitudes and concerns into their treatment recommendations.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prior research has extensively documented the sunk-cost effect - an irrational attention to irrecoverable past costs while making pending investment or consumption decisions. In a series of experiments, we show that the sunk-cost effect weakens and sometimes disappears when consumers receive a windfall (unexpected) income at the time of making a decision. This unbudgeted income allows consumers to write off their past losses, thereby eliminating the pressure to consume in order to satisfactorily close the account. We further show that the similarity between the nature of the windfall income and the past sunk-cost moderates this relationship. More generally, we argue that mental accounts can be flexible and consumers may have discretion in moving money between different mental accounts.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Local inhabitants' perceptions, preferences, and reactions were investigated in Vikos-Aoos National Park, 25 years after its designation. Knowledge of aims of the park and source of information about them, necessity for infrastructure, reactions to certain policies, and effectiveness of administration and management scheme were studied by means of a questionnaire survey. Personal interviews were performed by systematic sampling, which resulted in 203 cases for analysis. Most respondents said that they had knowledge of the aims of the national park, and this was positively associated with education; protection of flora and fauna was identified by most as the main aim, and the management authority (the Forest Service) ranked first in order as source of information. Tourism development of the area was seen as a positive change, and recreation facilities and improvement in accessibility were considered of high priority for development. The investigation into peoples' reactions to several possible alternative management policies revealed willingness to accept certain restrictions on their agricultural use of the land. A policy of nonintensive agriculture with compensation for loss of income, if the ecosystems of the park were in danger, seems the most acceptable. Long-term leasing of farms by the Forest Service was another policy with a high degree of acceptance, especially for certain occupational groups; those working in the secondary and tertiary sectors of economy would accept such a policy more easily than those working in the primary sector. Finally, a very Large majority of the respondents expressed a preference for a new administration and management scheme with the participation of local communities in the decision-making process.\u001b[0m :\n",

The majority of subjects fail to find the most economical way of choosing between two possible prospects. Many subjects underestimate the value of information and, as a result, make avoidable forecasting errors. Other subjects learn correctly which action is most successful under any given condition but fail to implement this knowledge efficiently. They either accept errors for the sake of economizing on small amounts of information costs or they invest in redundant information. The measured losses are substantial. However, in certain settings the fact that half of the economist-subjects and one-fourth of non-economist-subjects learn to behave optimally may be sufficient for efficient market functioning.

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: This article reviews the relevant literature on treatment-induced alopecia in women with cancer and describes the development of a computer-assisted intervention to reduce distress associated with this side effect. DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM: Alopecia has been cited as the most disturbing anticipated side effect by up to 58% of women preparing for chemotherapy, with 8% being at risk for avoiding treatment. Women with cancer who experience alopecia as a side effect, compared with women with cancer and no alopecia, report lower self-esteem, poorer body image, and lower quality of life. Although physicians' recommendations are the most influential factor on cancer treatment choice, body image and effects on sexuality are the next most influential factors. A study of a computer-imaging intervention, based on concepts related to guided imagery and anticipatory grief, has been launched in an effort to aid women in coping with anticipated treatment-related alopecia. RESULTS: While we are still waiting for final data collection and analysis from the computer intervention study, the feedback thus far has been positive. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The intervention described here may prove to be effective in desensitizing women with cancer to hair loss and facilitating an adjustment to self-acceptance. As such, a higher quality of life during the difficult time of coping may be maintained. The development of a computer-imaging intervention offers an opportunity to integrate a standard psychosocial intervention, personlized for each patient, into the routine patient are in the oncology setting.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Suicide has long been recognized as a major public health problem. Suicide prevention, through the provision of ambulatory crisis therapy which, if successful, eliminates the desire to die, or through protective hospitalization which, first and foremost, eliminates the opportunities, is thus part of society's resource allocation problem. A prerequisite for undertaking either of these measures is that suicide-contemplating individuals apply for help. The present paper addresses the individual's problem of whether to commit suicide or to apply for last-minute help, as well as the mental health practitioner's problem of whether to hospitalize a suicide-threatening individual or to offer him ambulatory crisis therapy. While the individual faces the risk of involuntary hospitalization, the practitioner faces the risk of suicide. Acting as a cost-oriented social welfare agent, the practitioner bases his decision on the likelihood that the suicide threat is genuine, so as to minimize society's expected loss from suicide and suicide-prevention efforts. The paper analyzes the interaction between the suicidal individual and the mental health practitioner within a simple game-theoretic framework, deriving both parties' equilibrium strategies as well as implications for public health policy aimed at enhancing help-seeking behavior. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper first discusses historic differences in the way that personality psychologists and decision-making researchers have studied risk-taking, and then describes a preliminary study that combines elements of the two approaches. Using an Italian sample of varying age levels, this study examined the relations among personality traits (the Big-Five), demographics (age and gender) and risk-taking. Separate measures of risk-taking in a controlled experimental task were derived for trials in which subjects could achieve a gain and for trials in which subjects could avoid a loss. Personality trait effects differed for gains and for losses, and they differed depending on whether demographics were taken into account. Personality factors predicted risk-taking primarily in the domain of gains where high scores on Openness to Experience were associated with greater risk-taking and high scores on Neuroticism were associated with less risk-taking. However, there was a tendency for Neuroticism to have the opposite effect on risk-taking for losses where high scores were associated with greater risk-taking. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

The net effect has been discussed conceptually for many years. This study illustrates an empirical evaluation of it, as well as of gains to tourists. Survey responses to hypothetical ski resort development in Are, Sweden, indicate that some residents gain from such an expansion while others lose; the net effect on the community is negative over the range of slopes evaluated. Tourists gain from expansion, but their gains are not great enough to outweigh the net losses for residents, such that the welfare change for society as a whole is negative. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

      "Abstract: A study is described of the risk management strategies employed by consumers who have made a purchase by credit. Realistic scenarios involving the purchase of consumer durables were used and adults with a variety of occupations and a range of experience of credit participated (N = 96). They were presented with minimal descriptions of alternative credit offers and an option to buy insurance to cover repayment difficulties due to job loss or illness. Participants could request any information required while deciding, and afterwards they summarized how they had reached their decision. Verbal protocols for the repayment insurance decision were generally consistent with a revised version of Huber's (1997) model of risk management. In this two-dimensional threshold model, if a risk exceeds both a loss probability and a loss value threshold, risk defusing operators are activated. Some strategies not consistent with the model were also observed, either involving more complex compensatory thinking, or simply anticipating and bearing the risk. Finally, previous experience and emotional responses were found to be associated with risk management behaviour.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Problem: Commercial fishing is one of the least safe occupations. This study investigates determinants of vessel total losses and number of fatal and nonfatal crew injuries resulting from commercial fishing vessel accidents. Method: An injury and vessel damage accident model is developed. Total vessel loss and crew injury models are estimated using probit and negative binomial regressions, respectively, and a unique micro data set of commercial fishing vessel accidents. Results: Estimation results indicate that the probability of a total loss is the greatest for a capsizing, followed by a sinking accident. Fire/explosions and capsizings are expected to incur the greatest number of crew fatalities - 3.5 and 3.8 for every 100 such accidents. For every 100 collisions, 2.1 nonfatal crew injuries are expected. The probability of a total loss and the expected number of crew fatalities vary inversely with the price of fish catches. Discussion: We discuss relevant issues related to fishing vessel safety management and regulation. Important vessel safety measures are summarized. Summary: Policy implications: (a) policies that reduce capsizings and sinkings will be effective in reducing fishing vessel accident total losses; (b) policies that reduce fire/explosions and capsizings (collisions) will be effective in reducing fatal (nonfatal) injuries. Impact on Industry: Policymakers should find the results of this study useful in developing regulation and enforcement mechanisms for reducing fishing vessel injuries and total losses. © 2001 National Safety Council and Elsevier Science Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Damasio has proposed an influential model of human decision making - the somatic marker hypothesis (Damasio AR. Descates' Error. London: Papermac/Macmillan, 1994), where he argues that somatic feedback to the brain influences decision making in man. It is proposed that when choosing between options that differ in relative risk, a somatic marker (e.g. a 'gut feeling') feeds back to the brain and influences cognitive appraisal. In the present study patients who had suffered a complete tetraplegia at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra were compared with matched healthy control subjects. As the spinal injury group have reduced somatic/peripheral feedback via the spinal cord, it was predicted, based on the somatic marker hypothesis, that they may demonstrate riskier behaviour than controls. All subjects completed the Iowa Gambling Task, a computerised card playing game where the player is instructed to try and win as much money as possible over 100 selections from one of four decks. The rules are not disclosed in advance, and the player gradually 'learns' that two of the decks are 'high risk' and lead to significant financial losses. Healthy individuals have previously been shown to learn to avoid the risky decks, whereas patients with medial frontal lobe damage (Bechara A, Damasio AR, Damasio H, Anderson SW. Insensitivity to future consequences following damage to human prefrontal cortex. Cognition 1994;50:7-15) and those with peripheral neuropathy (Bechara A, Tranel D, Wilson J, Heberlein AS, Ross M, Damasio AR, 1998. Impaired decision-making in peripheral neuropathy. Society for Neuroscience Abstracts 24:1176) select an excessive number from the risky decks, and consequently lose money. In the present study there were no significant differences between the spinal sectioned and healthy control groups in either card selection strategy or net financial outcome. This result suggests that in terms of the somatic marker hypothesis, feedback to the brain from the periphery via the cranial vagus and other nerves and the hormonal route may be equally or more influential than afferent feedback transmitted via the spinal cord.

Today, loss estimation techniques are translated into efficient software applications that are accessible by a large constituency of end-users. These techniques offer a high level of analysis sophistication and enable users to perform various 'if -then scenarios to study the sensitivity of the results, to develop a better understanding of the outcomes and to gain insight in the consequences of the findings and decisions. Functionality of loss estimation models has improved significantly due to advances in information technology such as the introduction of Geographical Information Systems (GIS).

      "Abstract: In qualitative decision-theoretic planning, desires - qualitative abstractions of utility functions - are combined with defaults - qualitative abstractions of probability distributions - to calculate the expected utilities of actions. This paper is inspired from Lang's framework of qualitative decision theory, in which utility functions are constructed from desires. Unfortunately, there is no consensus about the desirable logical properties of desires, in contrast to the case for defaults. To do justice to the wide variety of desires we define parameterized desires in an extension of Lang's framework. We introduce three parameters, which help us to implement different facets of risk. The strength parameter encodes the importance of the desire, the lifting parameter encodes how to determine the utility of a set (proposition) from the utilities of its elements (worlds), and the polarity parameter encodes the relation between gain of utility for rewards and loss of utility for violations. The parameters influence how desires interact, and they thus increase the control on the construction process of utility functions from desires.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article reexamines the assumptions underlying the disease problem used by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) to illustrate gain-loss formulation effects. It is argued that their reported effect may have been due to asymmetries in the ambiguity of the sure and risky prospects and to the entanglement of two distinct types of formulation manipulations: one having to do with the expected outcomes that are made explicit (positive vs negative) and the other having to do with the descriptors used to convey the relevant expected outcomes (lives saved/not saved vs lives lost/not lost). Two experiments using a formally equivalent problem in which these confounds were eliminated revealed no significant predictive effect of either descriptor or outcomes frames on choice, although a marginally significant framing effect was obtained in Experiment 1 when the signs of the two framing manipulations were congruent.

      "Abstract: This paper examines the gulf between the perceptions of risk and risk management of twelve New Zealand outdoor instructors and the definitions and managerial practices surrounding risk and risk management. This gulf is supported by the discursive practices of risk and risk management which privileges objective and rational models of thinking, denying the subjective experience of both the instructor and the student. Broadening the definitions of risk to recognize the opportunities as well as the loss inherent within risk, better reflects the complexity of this phenomenon. This may open the way for discussion about risk as a social process, rather than just a process of rational decision-making. Refocusing the risk debate on the opportunities it provides may allow the discussion to move away from risk being dominated by its management, to focusing on the learning goals and objectives of adventure education. © 2001, © 2001 Association of Experiential Education.\u001b[0m :\n",

Practicing sales managers and human resource managers evaluated a simulated hiring scenario for an open sales position and indicated their preferences between two job candidates with different levels of risk and performance potential. Experimental conditions were level of decision impact (sales manager or HR manager), decision frame (loss or gain), and time of valuation (outcome of the decision known soon or in the more distant future). The results provide evidence to support the findings of prior research in that an interaction occurred between decision frame and time of valuation such that the higher risk/higher performance potential candidate was preferred when managers framed the decision from a loss domain and the decision outcome occurred in the future. In addition, the higher risk/higher performance potential candidate was more preferred by sales managers than by HR managers.

      "Abstract: In this study, which examines the dynamics involved in setting advertising budgets, the social dilemma theory was applied in an attempt to understand the interdependency problems of advertisers in their investment decisions. In an experiment, a budget decision was made for a company after a period in which the company's market shares had either increased, decreased, or remained stable. Subjects were pre-screened with regard to their social value orientation (cooperative vs competitive). Half of the subjects were informed of the threat of social dilemmas and of the possible negative consequences; the other half were not informed. Budget decisions can be predicted on the basis of subjects' social value orientations and the awareness of the threat of social dilemmas. Subjects with a relatively strong competitive orientation are more zealous in setting their budgets. However, the awareness variable shows the strongest effects, especially in conditions when subjects experience a declining market share. It was concluded that knowledge about the dynamics of social dilemmas may prevent advertisers from a competitive reaction to the loss of share and may thus prevent them from becoming trapped in a competitive (social) dilemma. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: We assess valuation effects on creditors holding the private debt of client firms that file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and disaggregate the results by type of private creditor, form of bankruptcy resolution, and subsequent control bid activity. Among private creditors holding unsecured claims, losses are consistently more severe for trade creditors than for bank creditors. These losses are mitigated for cases in which petitioning firms subsequently reorganize and become targets of control bids during the Chapter 11 process. Banks holding secured claims sustain zero excess returns regardless of the type of bankruptcy resolution or subsequent control activity. Our results support the view that bank loans are effectively senior debt and that banks have a key role in continuation/liquidation decisions. Moreover, we find that control bids for firms in Chapter 11 are common and generate significant gains to equityholders of firms in Chapter 11 and to bidders, so that corporate control activity is an important element in the bankruptcy process. © 2001.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This research is an investigation of the hedonic intensities of elation and disappointment following the outcomes of risky gambles using two principles: disappointment aversion and the principle of limited emotion processing. Disappointment aversion implies a stronger impact of disappointment compared with elation; the principle of limited emotion processing predicts a smaller impact of elation if it occurs with a real gain, and a smaller impact of disappointment if it occurs with a real loss. Both principles support each other in the gain domain but operate against each other in the loss domain. It was predicted that disappointment would outweigh elation in the gain domain. For the loss domain, this question was left open to empirical scrutiny. Participants were provided with hypothetical gambles and were required to imagine having won, not won, lost, or not lost, money. Results supported the prediction for the gain domain; mixed results emerged for the loss domain.

      "Abstract: Decision theory is the study of models of judgement involved in, and leading to, deliberate and (usually) rational choice. In real estate investment, there are models for the pricing and allocation of assets. These asset allocation models suggest an optimum allocation between the respective asset classes based on retrospective judgements of performance and risk. The representation and role of real estate in a multi-asset portfolio has, historically, been viewed in the context of portfolio theory. Real estate is selected, as other assets, on the basis of some criteria, e.g. commonly, its marginal contribution to the production of a mean-variance efficient multi-asset portfolio, subject to the investor's objectives and capital rationing constraints. However, decisions are made relative to current expectations and current business constraints. Whilst a decision-maker may believe in the required optimum exposure levels, as dictated by an asset allocation model, the final decision may/will be influenced by factors outside the parameters of the mathematical model. The focus of decision theory is on the mathematical models. These may be probability based, loss functions, or other forms of statistical representations of judgements. Yet, much of decision theory does not lie entirely within any one discipline: it draws upon psychology, economics, mathematics, statistics, social sciences and many other areas of study. This paper discusses investors' perceptions and attitudes towards real estate, and highlights the important difference between theoretical exposure levels and pragmatic business considerations. The lynchpin in the decision-making process is how investors perceive risk. The concept of risk plays a central role in various kinds of decision problems under uncertainty. It is possible that the definition of risk within an asset allocation model, where risk is equated with the uncertainty of achieving a specific required return, sits uncomfortably with the definition of risk used by the decision-maker, where risk may equate to the consequence of not matching the performance of the competitors. In this paper, the author discusses the behavioural aspects of the decision-making process for UK pension funds in their asset allocation role, and relates the various decision-making models to the that process. Whilst the apparent question being asked is ‘how much should they invest in real estate?’, the answer achieved must be viewed in the context of what is pragmatically possible, or institutionally acceptable, with the constraints of business risk considerations. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Challenges the assumption that using accounting discretion to manipulate contracting variables will only result in a redistribution of wealth. Develops a mathematical model based on Feltham and Ohlson (1995) and uses it to explore the bank manager’s optimal investment in risky assets, the constraint on investment choice produced by minimum regulatory capital requirements and how accounting discretion can reduce this. Shows that regulatory requirements do constrain a bank’s IOS but that discretion (e.g. over loan loss provisions) can only mitigate this if dividend and financing policies depend on the discretionary components. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Issues and risks for pastoral care and counseling from the perspective of old age (here, ages 75 to 100) include identification of old age as a \"problem\" and its association with death in a death-denying culture. Two elements are fundamental: existential experiential deficits between the old and their younger caregivers (e.g., age cohort experiences, health status, gender, culture, privilege, etc.); and boundary issues that push the old, and pastoral care, to the edge of experience, where choices must be made between creativity and negativity (e.g., moving to dependent living, disability, etc.). Loss of doing (versus being) as a viable option is a major edge experience. The resulting sense of \"emptiness\" carries with it the potential for a sacramental awareness in which absence of doing becomes an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. © 2001 Human Sciences Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study uses an experiment to examine the separate and combined effects of managers' loss aversion and their causal attributions about their divisions' performance on tendencies to make goal-incongruent capital budget recommendations. We find that managers' recommendations are biased by their loss aversion. In particular, managers of high-performing divisions are more likely than managers of low-performing divisions to propose investments that maximize their division's short-term profits at the expense of the firm's long-term value. We also find that managers' recommendations are biased by their causal attributions. In particular, managers are more likely to propose investments that maximize their division's short-term profits at the expense of the firm's long-term value when they attribute their division's performance to external causes (e.g., task difficulty or luck) rather than to internal causes (e.g., managerial ability or effort). Further, the effects of causal attributions are greater for managers of high-performing divisions than for managers of low-performing divisions. The study's findings are important because loss aversion and causal attributions are often manifested in firms.

      "Abstract: This study examines bank managers' three major motivations for discretionary behavior with respect to loan loss provisions: signaling, income smoothing, and capital management. To do so, it utilizes a bank-specific time-series regression approach that captures heterogeneity in the banks' priorities and strategies for alternative motives and compares the results to those from alternative model specifications. The statistical tests and results presented in this study lead to three conclusions. First, significant results for the income smoothing hypothesis are robust to the various model specifications. Second, average signaling coefficients estimated from bank-specific regressions are systematically larger than corresponding coefficients from pooled time-series cross-sectional regressions and are statistically significant. Finally, bank managers appear to use loan loss provisions to manage their regulatory capital levels by comparing them with the minimum ratios specified by regulators rather than with a time-series bank-specific ratio or pooled time-series cross-sectional mean ratio. © 2001 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Family caregivers for relatives with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) often experience significant stress-related problems in mental and physical health. Patients with AD often survive for protracted periods of time, placing an extensive burden of care on the caregiver prior to the patient's death. The present study addresses ethnic differences in the experience of AD caregivers around the time of their loved one's death, including life-sustaining treatment decisions and reactions to death. The results showed that, in our sample, more patients died in their homes than has been reported for deaths in the United States. African-American and White caregivers differed substantially in their reports of end of life care and subjective reactions to the death. Compared with White caregivers, African-American caregivers were less likely to make a decision to withhold treatment at the time of death, less likely to have their relative die in a nursing home, and reported less acceptance of the relative's death and greater perceived loss. Results suggest that death after AD caregiving deserves further study, and that ethnic differences in end of life care and bereavement may be of particular importance.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aim: To compare the emotional effects of tooth loss in three partially dentate populations. Design: A questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was completed by 150 partially dentate subjects undergoing routine prosthodontic care at Guy's, King's and St Thomas's Dental Institute, London; the Dental School, Dundee, Scotland; and the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Hong Kong. Data were analysed using the Chi-square test. Results: Forty nine per cent of all participants reported difficulties in accepting the loss of some of their teeth. People from Dundee were less likely to have difficulties accepting tooth loss (P = 0.001). People from London took longer to come to terms with their tooth loss and were more likely to feel less confident (P < 0.001). Fifty five per cent of all participants restricted their choice of foods and 54 per cent had not enjoyed their food as much as before. Fewer people in Dundee restricted their choice of food (P < 0.001) and were more likely to enjoy their food (P = 0.009). People in Hong Kong were most likely to restrict their choice of food (P = 0.006). Thirty five percent of all subjects felt unprepared for the effects that tooth loss had upon them. People in Hong Kong were more prepared for tooth loss than those in Dundee and London (P = 0.003). In addition, they were less concerned about leaving their dentures out overnight (P= 0.024). Conclusions: The emotional effects of tooth loss were significant in all groups. People from London took longer to come to terms with their tooth loss. © 2001 FDI/World Dental Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

One part used an Ellsberg-type task which allowed for both aggregate and individual level analysis of Attitude toward Ambiguity. The other part used an expanded risky choice task to assess the same subjects' Attitude toward Risk. While there was an overall tendency for subjects to be slightly ambiguity-averse, there was a positive correlation between Attitude toward Ambiguity and Attitude toward Risk. This relation was particularly strong when the risky choice was to avoid a loss rather than to achieve a gain. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study uses National Educational Longitudinal Study data to show that information about higher education, guidance, and essential preparatory actions taken by secondary students influence whether they will attend postsecondary educational institutions (PEIs) within 2 years of high school graduation, and, if so, what types of institutions. The conceptual framework is embedded in research on college choice and talent loss. Talent loss is described as the occurrence of promising students not reaching their full educational potential. Choice theory attempts to explain the myriad factors contributing to individuals' postsecondary destinations. We find that increased levels of information, guidance, and critical actions taken are positively and significantly associated with initial enrollment in a 4-year PEI, as opposed to enrollment in a 2-year PEI (full or part time) or no enrollment. These factors explain a large part of the effect of socioeconomic status on postsecondary destination, controlling for high school achievement.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: According to classical utility theory the valuation of any lottery should depend only on its outcomes and their respective probabilities, and should not be affected by the nature, complexity and structure of the chance mechanism. Previous research has documented systematic violations of this principle. For example, most subjects prefer lotteries in which the payoffs are contingent on the joint occurrence of multiple (high probability) events to simple lotteries, and lotteries in which the earlier stages offer higher probabilities than the later stages. We review the various violations of this principle and suggest a classification into two major types associated with misunderstanding of chance mechanisms and attitude towards the chance mechanism and process. In the present study 40 subjects were presented with 30 pairs of binary gambles. In any given pair the lotteries had identical outcomes and equal 'reduced' probabilities (and thus equal expected values). However, the chance mechanisms varied along a variety of factors such as the size of the sample space, the number of stages, temporal ordering, order of probabilities, their transparency and time constraints. Half the subjects saw lotteries involving gains and the other half considered only losses. After choosing one lottery in each pair, the subjects were asked to explain and justify their choices. The findings revealed systematic violations of the reducibility principle: subjects displayed a preference for lotteries with larger sample spaces, and for lotteries that allow quicker resolutions in the earlier stages. A clear distinction between some patterns of preferences in the gains and loss domains was revealed. In gambles involving gains subjects preferred to have the highest probability on the first stage (and the lowest probability on the last stage), but displayed the opposite preferences for losses. A content analysis of the subjects' stated reasons for their choices identified eight major categories. The most frequently invoked were hope, fun, simplicity, stress and time.

      "Abstract: This paper proposes a quantitative modification of standard utility elicitation procedures, such as the probability and certainty equivalence methods, to correct for commonly observed violations of expected utility. Traditionally, decision analysis assumes expected utility not only for the prescriptive purpose of calculating optimal decisions but also for the descriptive purpose of eliciting utilities. However, descriptive violations of expected utility bias utility elicitations. That such biases are effective became clear when systematic discrepancies were found between different utility elicitation methods that, under expected utility, should have yielded identical utilities. As it is not clear how to correct for these biases without further knowledge of their size or nature, most utility elicitations still calculate utilities by means of the expected utility formula. This paper speculates on the biases and their sizes by using the quantitative assessments of probability transformation and loss aversion suggested by prospect theory. It presents quantitative corrections for the probability and certainty equivalence methods. If interactive sessions to correct for biases are not possible, then the authors propose to use the corrected utilities rather than the uncorrected ones in prescriptions of optimal decisions. In an experiment, the discrepancies between the probability and certainty equivalence methods are removed by the authors' proposal.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although immigrants and refugees share the experience of adapting to a new country, life experiences and circumstances surrounding leaving their homelands are vastly different. The most salient difference is their motivation for leaving. Immigrants typically leave their homeland to seek improved economic opportunities and/or to join other family members. Refugees leave their homeland under the threat of injury or loss of life due to political or religious persecution and severe deprivation of basic life necessities. Since the decision to migrate is often viewed as a positive change for immigrant women in comparison to refugee women, mental health problems may be under -detected. The researchers will describe the prevalence of depression in two of the largest groups of migrant women in the U.S., immigrant Mexican women (N=220) and refugee Southeast Asian women (N=163). The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast life circumstances that may impact on the prevalence of depression in both groups of women. The issues presented are important for nurses internationally who assess and design interventions for immigrant and refugee populations of women.\u001b[0m :\n",

The purpose of this explorative study was to uncover and interpret the experiences, values, and meaning of being in daily occupations of older adults with functional impairments. Method. Interviews were conducted with 21 older adults with disabilities who were between 70 and 92 years of age. The interviews occurred in their home environments; 18 of the 21 participants lived alone. The interviews were analyzed using a constant comparative approach. Findings. Occupational themes related to participation against the odds, retreat from occupation, the need for an invitation from others, and personal meanings related to capacities for occupation were uncovered. Conclusions. The findings suggest that the loss of positive belief in enjoyable occupations can be a sign of reduced hope in late life. For occupational therapists, whether an older adult has made a conscious choice to withdraw from occupational life or has too few occupational choices is important to distinguish.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study examined the relationship between coping with loss and impaired control over gambling in a sample of regular poker machine players (N = 226). Participants were classified into either a low control or high control group, based on their level of control over gambling behaviour as measured by the Scale of Gambling Choices (SGC; Baron, Dickerson, & Blaszczynski, 1995). Coping responses were assessed for three loss scenarios (a gambling loss, an uncontrollable loss, and a controllable loss) using a modified version of the COPE inventory (Carver, Scheier, & Weintraub, 1989). Players with low control over their gambling used significantly more avoidance-focused coping strategies than high control players, across all loss situations, regardless of the stressors appraised controllability. No significant difference was found between the groups for their use of either emotion-or problem-focused coping strategies when managing losses unrelated to gambling. The results clarify earlier ambiguous findings and lend support for the role of coping in the erosion of control over gambling, as proposed by Dickerson and Baron (2000).\u001b[0m :\n",

Intimacy and nudity were also threats for women. • Three styles of adjustment and acceptance were identified within the data and related to positive acceptance, resigned acceptance and passive acceptance. • There appeared to be a relationship between independence and control, with elders losing some independence but retaining control through choice, payment and involvement in decision making. • Reciprocity was found to bring added value to relationships between care providers and elders, with a rhythm and symmetry developing in relationships where needs were known, anticipated and met. • Seniors should be encouraged to plan for their future and to find out about local help and services available to them in advance of their requiring any assistance. © 2001 Blackwell Science Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Experimental studies have found significantly higher acceptance rates for a sequence of lotteries if the overall distribution was displayed instead of the set of lotteries itself. Mental accounting and loss aversion provide an easy and intuitive explanation for this phenomenon. In this paper we offer an explanation that incorporates further evaluation concepts of Prospect Theory. Our formal analysis of the difference in aggregated and segregated portfolio evaluation demonstrates that the higher attractiveness of the aggregated presentation mode is not a general phenomenon (as suggested in the literature) but depends on specific parameters of the lotteries. The theoretical findings are supported by an experimental study. In contrast to the existing evidence and in line with our theoretical results, we find for specific types of lotteries an even lower acceptance rate if the overall distribution is displayed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore and describe parents' experiences and feelings when faced with a pregnancy subsequent to a pregnancy in which they had to choose whether or not to terminate following the diagnosis of a fetal abnormality. DESIGN AND METHOD: Exploratory/descriptive study, using the grounded theory method. SETTING: Participants were recruited through physicians in northeastern Florida and throughout the United States via an Internet support network. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included a registered nurse, a physician, and 22 parents (13 women and 9 partners) who were interviewed during a subsequent pregnancy. RESULTS: Mental anguish resulted after a loss due to fetal anomalies. Such parents felt a loss of innocence and a sense of devastation and experienced changes in spousal relationships, fear of hope, isolation, and stigma. This anguish reemerged during a subsequent pregnancy. The parents managed by developing emotional armor, limiting disclosure of the previous and present pregnancy, delaying attachment to the baby, and forming a strong attachment to health care professionals and other people with similar experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding how parents manage the reemergence of mental anguish during a subsequent pregnancy permits health care professionals to assist these parents. Facilitating parents' efforts to develop emotional armor, limit disclosure, delay attachment to the baby, and attach to health care professionals and support groups can mitigate social and psychologic discomfort for these parents.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One aspect of O'Connor's Decisional Conflict Scale [O'Connor, A.M., Validation of a decisional conflict scale, Med. Decis. Making 15 (1995) 25-30] is the assessment of selected factors (perceived lack of information, undue social pressure, lack of support from others, and lack of clarity about personal values) that are believed to contribute to decisional uncertainty. This study explored the appropriateness of this uncertainty measure in the substitute decision-making context. Forty-nine mothers deciding on gastrostomy tube insertion for their children completed the scale, and also provided verbal reports about the contributory factors. For each of the four factors, relatively high-, moderate-, and low-scoring sub-groups were identified; then the associated verbal reports were examined for across-sub-group differences. Differences in verbal reports about information (χ2=6.990, P=0.0082), perceived pressure (χ2=8.377, P=0.0038), social support (χ2=5.573, P=0.0182), and perceived gains and losses (χ2=3.85, P=0.0499; χ2=5.76, P=0.0164) were observed, implying consistency between quantitative scores and verbal reports. This quantitative/qualitative hybrid approach may be clinically useful for assessing individually mediated factors contributing to decision uncertainty, and for evaluating therapeutic interventions in other substitute decision-making contexts.

Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we measured brain activation in human subjects doing an emotion-related visual reversal-learning task in which choice of the correct stimulus led to a probabilistically determined 'monetary' reward and choice of the incorrect stimulus led to a monetary loss. Distinct areas of the OFC were activated by monetary rewards and punishments. Moreover, in these areas, we found a correlation between the magnitude of the brain activation and the magnitude of the rewards and punishments received. These findings indicate that one emotional involvement of the human orbitofrontal cortex is its representation of the magnitudes of abstract rewards and punishments, such as receiving or losing money.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the clinical setting, Huntington's disease is associated with problems in judgment and decision making, however, the extent of these problems and their association with clinical characteristics have not been assessed. Recently, a laboratory-based simulated gambling task has been used to quantify similar decision-making deficits in ventromedial frontal lobe damaged participants. We hypothesized that participants with Huntington's disease (HD) would show deficits on this gambling task. For this study, 14 HD participants were asked to make 100 selections from four decks of cards with varied payoffs in order to maximize winnings of play money. They were compared to 22 participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 33 healthy controls. After an initial period in which participants had to learn contingencies of the decks, the HD group made fewer advantageous selections that the PD and control groups. In HD, the number of advantageous selections in the gambling task was correlated with measures of memory and conceptualization but not disinhibition. Thus, people with HD may have had difficulties learning or remembering win/loss contingencies of the decks, or they may have failed to consistently take these into account in their card selections. These findings are consistent with current models of frontal-subcortical brain circuits and behavior.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Different attitudes towards gains and losses are a prominent feature of cumulative prospect theory for decision under uncertainty. In particular, decision weights for uncertain events can depend on whether the events involve gains or losses, and the shape of the utility function can reveal loss aversion. Decision analyses concentrate on event capacities, which determine decision weights, and on the shape of the utility function. The present paper focuses on linear/exponential, power-function and multilinear utility models for decision under uncertainty. We begin with straightforward preference axioms for a representation by a cumulative prospect theory functional. The axioms include weak ordering, continuity, monotonicity and tail independence. We show that in their presence constant absolute (proportional) risk aversion implies linear/exponential (power) utility. Then, for the multiattribute case, (mutual) utility independence leads to a utility function that is (additive/multiplicative) multilinear.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aims. Using the affect infusion model (AIM), this study aimed to assess the impact of prior mood on gaming persistence in regular and non-regular gamblers (assumed to be motivated and heuristic decision-makers, respectively). Design, measures and setting. A 2 × 3 experimental design in a laboratory setting employed factors of gambler type (regular, non-regular) and prior mood (happy, neutral, depressed). Measures were number of trials played on a gambling game, and mood ratings (post-mood induction, during and after play). Participants and intervention. Sixty regular and 60 non-regular gamblers (all male students) were assigned randomly to watch a video inducing one of the three mood conditions. They were then given AUD$10.00 to gamble in a computerized card-cutting game. Findings. AIM predictions were supported: prior mood did not affect gaming persistence for regular gamblers, but non-regulars showed reduced persistence across happy, neutral and depressed moods. After-play mood ratings were related to winnings for regulars, and losing regulars were significantly more unhappy after-play compared to during-play, and compared to both their winning counterparts and non-regulars. Mood and winnings were unrelated for non-regulars, with little during- to after-play mood change. Conclusions. The findings speak to depression as a causal factor in addictive gambling. Depressed mood did not enhance persistence in regular gamblers, but rather failed to have the inhibitory effect observed in non-regular gamblers. Evidence of mood changes during gambling was obtained, although multiple measures (self-report, physiological indicators, anticipated states) of both affective valence and arousal are advocated for future studies.\u001b[0m :\n",

The empathy-prospect model predicts that potential helpers make decisions in much the same way as decision makers in other contexts do (i.e., they evaluate prospects) and that perceptions of need and the empathic reactions and intentions to help that they generate will be stronger for people observing losses rather than gains. The model also predicts that intentions to help should increase when (a) the predicament is serious, (b) money is not involved, or (c) help entails few costs for the potential altruist. The results from 2 experiments provide clear support for these predictions. The findings suggest that (a) the gains or losses of another person contribute to perceptions of that person's needs and feelings of empathy, (b) empathy is the primary proximal determinant of prosocial motivations, and (c) potential losses that are serious accentuate altruistic reactions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Discussing risks and benefits of treatments or care options is becoming an increasingly important part of modern health care. This paper reviews the literature about manipulations of risk and benefit information in the clinical setting. There is a paucity of evidence in this field, particularly when examining specific manipulations. Only three categories of manipulation had three or more studies. The available evidence shows that the way information is presented can have significant effects on decisions made. The largest effects are evident when relative risk information is presented, as compared with absolute risk data. In addition, “loss framing” is more effective in influencing screening uptake behaviors than “gain framing” (odds ratio 1.18 [95% confidence interval 1.01-1.38]). There is also a pattern of evidence from studies comparing simpler with more complex information, more data with less, and those comparing numerical with verbal descriptions of risks. These studies suggest that providing more information, and which is more understandable to the patient, is associated with improved patient knowledge and a greater wariness to take treatments or participate in trials. These findings can contribute to efforts to improve communication between professionals and patients. © 2001 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

The examples are considered in relation to existence values, citizens' preferences, problems associated with aggregating social preferences, and the observation that there are costs associated with exercising rights. The problems of the use of opportunity costs as a means of compensation for lost rights to environmental values are those of (1) who should determine the values; (2) whether payments should be made as compensation or as fines; and (3) who should receive the payments. These problems raise issues of equity, particularly as poor people often have claims to rights over areas with high environmental values. In conclusion, the roles of equity and sovereignty in the distribution of entitlements are emphasised and the difficulty of taking a policy decision to use market mechanisms for conserving biodiversity is discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article explores the relationship between threat and information processing in various conflict situations and extends the analysis to an examination of the relationship between affective and cognitive components of decision making about policy under conditions of high and low threat. Elements of threatening situations are measured using public opinion surveys done mainly in Israel regarding the Arab/Israeli conflict and the conflict between religious and secular Jews. Some data from surveys done in the Palestinian Authority regarding support for the peace process and support for armed attacks against Israeli targets, and in the United States regarding the social crises of neighborhood crime out of control and the threat of loss of Social Security and Medicare benefits are included as two other illustrations of the relationship between threat and policy. The article focuses on how feelings of threat relate to decisions about how to deal with the situation and under what conditions those decisions will either be inflammatory or conciliatory. Data are presented demonstrating that feelings of threat correlate with policy choices regarding the threatening situation or group, and often at very strong levels. Specifically, the more threatened people feel, the more their policy choice tends to maintain or intensify the conflict - that is, the more incendiary the policy choice is - and vice versa - the lower the threat the more subdued the policy choice is. Our data analysis leads us to the proposition that when people feel very threatened - the decision making process about policy is dominated by emotion - not by logic or rational considerations. On the other hand, under conditions of low threat, both emotions and logic have a role in the process of deciding policy.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to consider the influence of selected health promotion and disease prevention interventions in elderly residents of a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) over a four-year period by comparing actual health promotion practices of the residents. DATA SOURCES: Original research using a descriptive design, face-to-face interviews of residents (N = 176-200), chart reviews, and administration of a mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and health survey administered annually. CONCLUSIONS: In each year the mean age of the residents was at least 85, the majority were female, Caucasian, and unmarried. With the exception of checking stools for occult blood, there was a statistically significant change in all health promotion behaviors over the four-year period. The most significant change was in the area of exercise behavior, which increased from 24% of the residents participating in regular exercise in year one to 61% by year four. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The purpose of health promotion and disease prevention in older adults is to reduce the potential years of life lost in premature mortality and ensure better quality of remaining life. In addition to regularly scheduled interventions (group education, on-site administration of pneumonia and flu vaccines, on-site exercise room and walking group), individualized counseling regarding the pros and cons of health-promotion activities was provided to help residents make an educated decision about engaging in these activities. These interventions can be used to help facilitate participation in health promotion activities as appropriate and desired for each older adult.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: Cost-of-illness studies have been completed on scores of diseases over the past 30 years. The goal of this study was to review published cost-of-illness studies on US populations in order to evaluate the potential usefulness of the results in decision making. Methods: Medline and related databases were searched using diagnosis and economic terms. The bibliographies of the articles found were reviewed visually to identify further studies. Inclusion criteria required a specified diagnosis, the study to be published between 1 January 1985 and 30 April 1999 in an English-language peer-reviewed journal, a clearly defined US sample or national population, available and recent epidemiological data on prevalence and incidence of diagnosis, and money estimates of direct and/or indirect costs. Three readers reviewed each study. The senior reviewer settled all differences. Results: Searches found 1725 published studies; only 110 (6.4%) met all inclusion criteria. Main reasons for rejection were insufficient cost data (80%), insufficient information on data sources and aggregation or estimation methods (56%), inadequate sector data e.g. hospitalisations or work loss (48%), study of value, not cost, of illness (44%), not a US population (30%) and insufficient population detail (19%). There were 80 diagnosis categories, 28 of which had more than one study. Only 5 diagnoses had ≥5 studies - Alzheimer's dementia, depression, diabetes mellitus, mental illness and stroke. Multifold cost variations were found among studies within diagnosis categories, even with the same method and data sources. The more narrowly defined diagnoses, depression and stroke, had the smallest cost variation, 41.7 and 17.2%, respectively. A generalised linear regression model found that a significant portion of total and direct cost variance could be explained only for Alzheimer's dementia. Conclusions: The wide variation of cost estimates for the same diagnosis raises serious questions of comparability, accuracy, validity, and usefulness of all studies. Implementing guidelines to standardise methods and study design for cost-of-illness studies would be a worthwhile first step. The advantages and disadvantages of using money or another metric such as disability-adjusted life-years as the prime outcome measure should also be publicly discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The online Yankee auction sells multiple units of the same good to multiple buyers using an ascending and open auction mechanism. One of the important controllable factors of the Yankee auction is the minimum bid increment, specified at the beginning of an auction. Bidders can bid only in the multiples of this bid increment even if they are willing to bid higher than the minimum required bid. This paper presents a simulation approach to optimize sellers' revenue, which is based on theoretical properties of Yankee auctions and utilizes data from real auctions to replicate a given auction. The simulation model can be configured to change the value of bid increment and explore whether a given auction used the optimal bid increment. Our analysis indicates that the auctioneers are, most of the time, far away from optimal choice of bid increment, resulting in substantial losses in a market with already tight margins.\u001b[0m :\n",

In our longitudinal study of parental decision making among families with a deaf child, we conducted in-depth interviews with 30 families, including six whose children had been identified prior to the age of six months. This paper presents interview segments from three of these families. Like the families of children identified later, these families report feeling shocked and devastated by the diagnosis, yet also reported feeling less pressure to make quick and often uninformed decisions. These families also encountered somewhat greater difficulty in getting an accurate diagnosis, getting their Children appropriately fitted with amplification devices, and in obtaining services from professionals experienced and knowledgeable about working with infants with hearing loss.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This case study elaborates the aftermath of the Blom-Cooper Inquiry (1992), which forced the special hospital, Ashworth, into a radical ‘culture change’. To this end, two groups of external consultants—a management consultancy and a professional task force—were introduced into the hospital. Newly established ward managers were to spearhead the organizational change by bringing social and clinical order to the wards over which the higher management had lost control. Few studies have mapped out the interaction between segments of an organization and expert outsiders. In this study, the interaction of the ward manager to the newly appointed external management consultancy and task force was analysed. It was clear that ward managers rated poorly the efforts of the management consultancy and task force—it was considered that they were not giving value for money. The task force rated slightly more favourably than the management consultancy. The fact that the management consultancy did not have ward credibility in this closed forensic setting was attributed to low prestige. The management consultancy also failed to fulfil the organizational ambitions of ward managers, who wished to be central to the hospital's major decision-making process. © 2001, SAGE Publications.

      "Abstract: During the 1990s competitive bidding became the principal way of allocating resources for urban regeneration. One of the objectives was to invigorate the approach of local authorities by exposing them to the pressure of competition. Another was to open up decisionmaking to a wider spectrum of interests, including the private sector and local communities. The authors examine the consequences for unsuccessful areas-an analysis which is crucial to any overall assessment of the approach. They focus on the competition for Priority Partnership Area Status associated with the reshaping of Scotland's Urban Programme under Programme for Partnership. The analysis reveals a modest stimulus to partnership working in several areas, attributable to the need for agencies to cooperate in a time-constrained bidding process and to manage 'compensation' funds thereafter. These benefits were offset by the disillusionment caused by the experience and the penalties of losing resources. To avoid widening inequalities in the future, the authors argue, central government must recognise the impact of this disillusionment through improvements in the organisation of competitive bidding and through planning mechanisms for the mitigation of the adverse effects of losing.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article tests the predictions of expected-utility and prospect theories against the most important dimensions of the Cuban missile crisis. Largely through use of the most recently released information on the crisis from the American and Soviet governments, I attempt to ascertain the anticipated benefits, costs, and probabilities of success associated with each of the major policy choices that the key leaders in both superpowers perceived before each of the major decisions throughout the crisis was made. Using this information and the logic of extensive-form game-theoretic models of choice, I construct a baseline for expected-utility theory that helps us to understand when prospect or expected-utility theory provides the better explanation for a particular decision. Prospect theory predicts that when individuals perceive themselves to be experiencing losses at the time they make a decision, and when their probability estimates associated with their principal policy options are in the moderate to high range, they will tend to make excessively risky, non-value maximizing choices. I find that the evidence for the Cuban missile crisis supports this prediction for the most important decisions made by both Khrushchev and Kennedy.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In an effort to take stock of the claims put forth by advocates of game theory, this article offers an assessment that considers game theory both as a set of theoretical principles that extends rational choice theory to interdependent decision making and as a type of formal methodology. Some important strengths of game theory are identified, such as its emphasis on actors and strategic choices and its ability to generate predictions in a logically rigorous and internally consistent manner. But many shortcomings are also discussed. One shortcoming is that the effort to develop a theory of action falls short, both in the sense of failing to provide a full explanation of actions and in the sense of not applying to domains of great significance. A second shortcoming is the failure of the prcedures used in formal modeling to offer guidance pertaining to a critical step in the process of modeling: the conceptualization of the model. Thus, the challenge facing scholars in comparative politics is to consider the new perspectives offered by game theory and draw upon its strengths, but to do so without losing sight of a series of old concerns.\u001b[0m :\n",

We argue that environmental regulation may deter economic growth in some contexts, however, in other contexts the benefits of regulation may be obtained with little or no economic loss We develop an explanation of the economic impacts of state environmental policy based on a model of public influence on private resource allocation decisions. In this model, we assume utility-maximizing firms will make investment choices based upon the projected profits on their investments and their willingness to accept the risk associated with the investments. We assert that state policies and administrative institutions influence perceptions of risk by increasing or decreasing uncertainty over future environmental policy and influence return on investments at particular locations by affecting firm-level production costs. Our results confirm that certain administrative arrangements for environmental regulation may enhance, rather than impede, economic development.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The risk evaluation process is integrated with procedures for handling vague and numerically imprecise probabilities and utilities. A body of empirical evidence has shown that many managers would welcome new ways of highlighting catastrophic consequences, as well as means to evaluate decision situations involving high risks. When events occur frequently and their consequences are not severe, it is relatively simple to calculate the risk exposure of an organization, as well as a reasonable premium when an insurance transaction is made, relying on variations of the principle of maximizing the expected utility. When, on the other hand, the frequency of damages is low, the situation is considerably more difficult, especially if catastrophic events may occur. When the quality of estimates is poor, e.g. when evaluating low-probability/highconsequence risks, the customary use of quantitative rules together with unrealistically precise data could be harmful as well as misleading. We point out some problematic features of evaluations performed using utility theory and criticize the demand for precise data in situations where none is available. As an alternative to traditional models, we suggest a method that allows for interval statements and comparisons, which does not require the use of numerically precise statements of probability, cost, or utility in a general sense. In order to attain a reasonable level of security, and because it has been shown that managers tend to focus on large negative losses, it is argued that a risk constraint should be imposed on the analysis. The strategies are evaluated relative to a set of such constraints considering how risky the strategies are. The shortcomings of utility theory can in part be compensated for by the introduction of risk constraints. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In decisions under uncertainty, decision makers confront two uncertainties: the uncertain linkage between actions and outcomes and the uncertain linkage between these outcomes and his or her affective responses to them. The two studies reported here examine affective responses to expected and unexpected outcomes in various settings. In Study 1, a scenario-based laboratory experiment (N = 149), we examined subjects' predicted responses to a range of outcomes, as a function of how surprising the outcome was. Study 2, a field study (N = 127), involved the expectations of bowlers about their scores in an upcoming game and about their responses to various outcomes at, above, and below expectations. We also measured actual affective reactions after the bowlers had completed their games. Findings suggest that subjects both expect and experience a loss-averse, expectation-based value function broadly of the Prospect Theory type. They also anticipate, and experience, an amplifying effect of outcome surprise, though they underestimate its size. We argue that such underestimation, together with overtight prediction ranges, may expose subjects to much larger affective variation with outcome variability than they anticipate. © 2001 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Little sociological attention has been paid to the repartnering of older people after widowhood, and how age, gender and the meanings of marriage influence choices about new cross-gender relationships. This paper reports on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 25 widows and 26 widowers over the age of 65, widowed for at least two years and who had not remarried. Respondents were asked about their current lifestyle and relationships and whether they had ever considered remarriage. The words 'selfish' and 'freedom' were often used by the widows when describing their present existence, which was associated with not having to look after someone all the time. Few of the widowers mentioned selfishness and this was more likely to be associated with feelings of anger at the loss of their spouse; none of the men associated widowhood with a sence of freedom. The paper argues that the desire for repartnering after widowhood is gender-specific: widows are more likely to choose to remain without a partner for intrinsic factors: the reluctance to relinguish a new-found freedom; while for widowers, extrinsic factors of older age and poor health are more salient issues in new partnership formation choices and constraints.\u001b[0m :\n",

Extant research on expert versus nonexpert perceptions of risk is reviewed, followed by the present study concerning risk perceptions of seven pen-picture scenarios involving the occurrence of hazardous events in the U.K. oil and gas production industry. In contrast to many of the earlier studies of expert versus nonexpert perceptions of risk, the present analysis concludes that experts did not judge the overall riskiness of the portrayed hazardous events as less risky than the nonexperts. Nevertheless, the experts believe more strongly than our nonexperts that the risks portrayed in the scenarios pose little threat to future generations, are more precisely known, and are relatively controllable. Use of multiple regression analysis to help uncover the basis of overall riskiness assessments for expert and lay respondents was inconclusive, however. Finally, little evidence was found that nonexperts were any more heterogeneous in their risk perceptions than experts. It may be that the nature of the risks assessed in the present study may account for the general lack of clear expert versus nonexpert differences in overall perceptions of the riskiness of hazardous events in the North Sea. Earlier findings of strong expert versus nonexpert differences in risk perception assessed hazards of major public concern.

A qualitative methodology was therefore adopted to provide a discovery-orientated study of the perspectives of ten women who had undergone prophylactic mastectomy and the views of eight of their partners. Each participant was interviewed with the aim of exploring the personal experiences of surgery, factors associated with psychological adjustment and the impact on the family. Data were transcribed and systematically analysed using Grounded Theory. Themes emerging from participants' accounts formed seven significant categories that represented women's key experiences: (i) deciding; (ii) telling; (iii) experiencing surgery and recovering; (iv) maintaining womanliness; (v) processing the loss; and (vi) moving on. The importance of the social context in women's experience and difficulties of isolation/eliciting support were also highlighted: (vii) isolation and being supported. A core category of 'Suffering and countering multiple loss' considered central to women's experience, integrated the seven significant categories and provided further conceptualisation of women's experience.

A theoretical control model was developed using expected total economic surplus as the objective function, with an empirical solution to the maximization problem attained by imposing a heuristic search procedure on a bioeconomic simulation model. Although the impact of non-dynamic decision making was the most severe, in percentage terms, for short-run planning horizons, the magnitude of the long-run losses associated with non-dynamic decision making could serve as a rationale for modifying the regulatory process to include dynamic considerations. The static analyses usually used in the benefits assessment procedure may severely underestimate the actual benefits of continued chemical registration, and the efficiency gains to society have the potential to offset the increased costs of regulation that would occur under a revised process.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An adaptive stochastic dynamic programming model was used to solve the optimum replacement decision problem for the dairy cow under a range of alternative mastitis control procedures. The model predicted that reducing milk yield losses and somatic cell count penalties by using milking machine test, post-milking teat disinfection and dry cow therapy added approximately £4, £l0 and £13 respectively to an original annuity equivalent net present value for the replacement heifer of £286. Assuming that these procedures also reduced involuntary culling due to mastitis by 50% added £8·90 to the annuity. This latter figure indicated that an important part of the benefit of mastitis control procedures might come from a reduction in the culling risk of persistent clinical cases. We concluded that the strength of the dynamic programming model in this context was that it provided an integrated evaluation of the various impacts of each alternative mastitis procedure in the long term, which is essential for correct economic evaluation of mastitis.\u001b[0m :\n",

DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews and analysis from a phenomenologic perspective. SETTING: A senior center and a multilevel retirement community in Los Angeles. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one elderly informants (mean age 83 years) representing a spectrum of functional status and prior experiences with end-of-life decision making. MAIN RESULTS: Informants were concerned primarily with the outcomes of serious illness rather than the medical interventions that might be used, and defined treatments as desirable to the extent they could return the patient to his or her valued life activities. Advanced age was a relevant consideration in decision making, guided by concerns about personal losses and the meaning of having lived a 'full life.' Decision-making authority was granted both to physicians (for their technical expertise) and family members (for their concern for the patient's interests), and shifted from physician to family as the patient's prognosis for functional recovery became grim. Expressions of care, both by patients and family members, were often important contributors to end-of-life treatment decisions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that advance directives and physician-patient discussions that focus on acceptable health States and valued life activities may be better suited to patients' end-of-life care goals than those that focus on specific medical interventions, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We propose a model of collaborative surrogate decision making by families and physicians that encourages physicians to assume responsibility for recommending treatment plans, including the provision or withholding of specific life-sustaining treatments, when such recommendations are consistent with patients' and families' goals for care.\u001b[0m :\n",

The difficulty with predicting to new circumstances is that often there is no way of knowing whether the empirical relationships upon which models are based will hold under the new conditions, and so predictions are of uncertain accuracy. 2. We present a model, based on the optimality approach of behavioural ecology, that is designed to overcome this problem. The model's central assumption is that each individual within a population always behaves in order to maximize its fitness. The model follows the optimal decisions of each individual within a population and predicts population mortality rate from the survival consequences of these decisions. Such behaviour-based models should provide a reliable means of predicting to new circumstances because, even if conditions change greatly, the basis of predictions - fitness maximization - will not. 3. The model was parameterized and tested for a shorebird, the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus. Development aimed to minimize the difference between predicted and observed overwinter starvation rates of juveniles, immatures and adults during the model calibration years of 1976-80. The model was tested by comparing its predicted starvation rates with the observed rates for another sample of years during 1980-91, when the oystercatcher population was larger than in the model calibration years. It predicted the observed density-dependent increase in mortality rate in these years, outside the conditions for which it was parameterized. 4. The predicted overwinter mortality rate was based on generally realistic behaviour of oystercatchers within the model population. The two submodels that predicted the interference-free intake rates and the numbers and densities of birds on the different mussel Mytilus edulis beds at low water did so with good precision. The model also predicted reasonably well (i) the stage of the winter at which the birds starved; (ii) the relative mass of birds using different feeding methods; (iii) the number of minutes birds spent feeding on mussels at low water during both the night and day; and (iv) the dates at which birds supplemented their low tide intake of mussels by also feeding on supplementary prey in fields while mussel beds were unavailable over the high water period. 5. A sensitivity analysis showed that the model's predictive ability depended on virtually all of its parameters. However, the importance of different parameters varied considerably. In particular, variation in gross energetic parameters had a greater influence on predictions than variations in behavioural parameters. In accord with this, much of the model's predictive power was retained when a detailed foraging submodel was replaced with a simple functional response relating intake rate to mussel biomass. The behavioural parameters were not irrelevant, however, as these were the basis of predictions. 6. Although we applied the model to oystercatchers, the general principle on which it is based applies widely. We list the key parameters that need to be measured in order to apply the model to other systems, estimate the time scales involved and describe the types of environmental changes that can be modelled. For example, in the case of estuaries, the model can be used to predict the impact of habitat loss, changes in the intensity or method of shellfishing, or changes in the frequency of human disturbance. 7. We conclude that behaviour-based models provide a good basis for predicting how demographic parameters, and thus population size, would be affected by novel environments. The key reason for this is that, by being based on optimal decision rules, animals in these models are likely to respond to environmental changes in the same way as real ones would.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prenatal diagnostic technology makes it possible to offer women the option of electively terminating pregnancies affected by birth defects. Excluding these pregnancies from epidemiologic studies may affect study results. We explored this effect using examples from the literature. We calculated the bias in the odds ratio caused by excluding prenatally diagnosed pregnancies when the exposure of interest is not correlated with the likelihood of terminating an affected pregnancy and when it is correlated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood. We assumed that control infants did not have birth defects. When the exposure is not associated with the likelihood of a pregnancy termination, studies excluding terminations suffer a loss of precision. When the exposure is associated with an increase or decrease in this likelihood, the odds ratios are biased toward or away from the null, respectively. The magnitude of the bias will vary according to characteristics of the study population such as the prevalence of the exposure and the frequency with which prenatal diagnosis and elective termination are used. Whenever possible, pregnancies terminated after prenatal diagnosis must be included in epidemiologic studies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: At retirement, most individuals face a choice between voluntary annuitization and discretionary management of assets with systematic withdrawals for consumption purposes. Annuitization–buying a life annuity from an insurance company–assures a lifelong consumption stream that cannot be outlived, but it is at the expense of a complete loss of liquidity. On the other hand, discretionary management and consumption from assets–self-annuitization–preserves flexibility but with the distinct risk that a constant standard of living will not be maintainable. In this paper we compute the lifetime and eventual probability of ruin (PoR) for an individual who wishes to consume a fixed periodic amount–a self-constructed annuity–from an initial endowment invested in a portfolio earning a stochastic (lognormal) rate of return. The lifetime PoR is the probability that net wealth will hit zero prior to a stochastic date of death. The eventual PoR is the probability that net wealth will ever hit zero for an infinitely lived individual. We demonstrate that the probability of ruin can be represented as the probability that the stochastic present value (SPV) of consumption is greater than the initial investable wealth. The lifetime and eventual probabilities of ruin are then obtained by evaluating one minus the cumulative density function of the SPV at the initial wealth level. In that eventual case, we offer a precise analytical solution because the SPV is known to be a reciprocal gamma distribution. For the lifetime case, using the Gompertz law of mortality, we provide two approximations. Both involve “moment matching” techniques that are motivated by results in Arithmetic Asian option pricing theory. We verify the accuracy of these approximations using Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, a numerical case study is provided using Canadian mortality and capital market parameters. It appears that the lifetime probability of ruin–for a consumption rate that is equal to the life annuity payout–is at its lowest with a well-diversified portfolio. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Evolution by variation and natural selection is often viewed as an optimization process that favors those organisms which are best adapted to their environment. This leaves open the issue of how to measure adaptation and what criterion is implied for optimization. This problem has been framed and analysed mathematically under the assumption that individuals compete to minimize expected losses across a series of decisions (e.g. cuy hoice of behavior), where each decision offers a stochastic payoff. But the fact that a particular analysis is tractable for a specified criterion does not imply the fidelity of that criterion. Computer simulations involving a version of the k-armed bandit problem can address the veracity of the hypothesis that individuals are selected to minimize expected losses. The results offered here do not support this hypothesis. (C) 2000 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many information system (IS) failures may result from the inadequate assessment of project risk. To help managers appraise project risk more accurately, IS researchers have developed a variety of risk assessment tools including checklists and surveys. Implicit in this line of research, however, is the assumption that the use of such devices will lead to more accurate risk perceptions that will, in turn, lead to more appropriate decisions regarding project initiation and continuation. Little is known, though, about the factors that influence risk perception or the interrelationships that exist among risk perception, risk propensity, and decisions about whether or not to continue a project. Without a better understanding of these relationships it is difficult to know whether the application of risk instruments will be an effective means for reducing the incidence of IS failure. This study presents the results of a laboratory experiment designed to: (1) examine the relative contribution of two factors that are believed to shape risk perception: probability that a loss will occur and the magnitude of the potential loss, and (2) explore the relative influence of risk perception and risk propensity on the decision of whether or not to continue a software development project. The results indicate that magnitude of potential loss is the more potent factor in shaping risk perception and that a significant relationship exists between risk perception and decision-making. The implications of these findings are discussed along with directions for future research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Public administration scholars and practitioners differ widely in their views regarding the ethical risks of entrepreneurial behavior and decisionmaking in the public sector. This article examines three cases, two from the United States and one from Colombia, which highlight the ethical issues raised when governments use the entrepreneurial tools of competition, privatization, and contracting out. Issues of job loss, favoritism, corruption, poor performance, and limited access to services often accompany the process of privatization/outsourcing. The political, legal, and economic problems in the Latin American context are somewhat different from those in North America, reflecting varying policy objectives and cultural and institutional contexts. The ethical dilemmas faced, however, are substantially the same. Several principles are suggested to guide public administrators through entrepreneurial ventures, including the need to take individual responsibility for the process and its consequences (past, present, and future), as well as the need for a heightened emphasis on thorough analysis and professional competence as an ethical imperative. © 2000, © 2000 by American Society of Public Administration, International City/County Management Association, and the Council of State Governments.

      "Abstract: A defining feature of drug addiction is persistent drug use despite long-term adverse consequences. This study examined the performance of drug abusers on a neuropsychological test that requires evaluation of long-term outcomes in the presence of a complex set of mixed reward/punishment contingencies (the Gambling Task). In order to control for generalized deficits related to choice and planning, subjects were also administered the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. Thirty polysubstance abusers were compared to a comparison group of 24 subjects who did not use illicit drugs of abuse. Drug abusers performed much more poorly on the Gambling Task (net score = 10.2 ± 4.7, mean ± s.e.m.) than controls (26.0 ± 5.3), but did not differ from controls on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task. The results show that drug abusers are more likely to make maladaptive decisions in the Gambling Task that result in long-term losses exceeding short-term gains. These findings indicate that the Gambling Task may be a useful model in laboratory studies of cognitive dysfunctions associated with drug abuse. Copyright (C) 2000.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Between 1972 and 1990, US electric utility companies cancelled orders for 117 nuclear power plants (NEI, 1996, pp. 1-6). The regulatory accounting methods adopted by utility rate setting commissions determined whether utilities could recover the losses on cancelled plants through higher rates. In effect, the choice of accounting methods determined how billions of dollars invested in cancelled nuclear plants was allocated between utility stockholders, ratepayers, and taxpayers (DOE/EIA, 1983, pp. ix-x). Our paper examines the economic consequences to stockholders of capital project abandonments in a regulated industry. The results show that while regulatory treatment of abandonment costs was generally favorable to investors, the market reacted negatively to nuclear project abandonment announcements indicating that investors did not expect to fully recoup abandonment losses. Two stage regression is used to investigate the determinants of the market's reaction to project cancellations. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper shows that managerial questions are not answered satisfactorily with the mathematical interpretation of sensitivity analysis when the solution of a linear programming model is degenerate. Most of the commercially available software packages provide sensitivity results about the optimality of a basis and not about the optimality of the values of the decision variables. The misunderstanding of the shadow price and the validity range information provided by a simplex based computer program may lead to wrong decision with considerable financial losses and strategic consequences. The paper classifies the most important types of sensitivity information, graphically illustrates degeneracy, and demonstrates its effect on sensitivity analysis. A production planning example is provided to show the possibility of faulty production management decisions when sensitivity results are not understood correctly. Finally the recommendations for the users of linear programming models and for software developers are provided.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To assess the health, activity and social status of the elderly. Methods: This Cross-sectional study with qualitative and quantitative designs was conducted in two areas of Karachi; one was a peri-urban squatter settlement and other a middle income community. The students of second year at Jinnah Medical College were trained to collect data, which was then entered on database IV and analyzed on the SPSS statistical package. Results: The average age of peri-urban respondents was 66 and urban was 69 years. Majority of the senior citizens were independent and 69% had active daily life (ADL), power of decision making for adults was related to their status in the family (p<0.000), majority were alert, happy and satisfied with life with no difference between urban and peri-urban residents. Fifty-three percent of peri-urban and 25% of the urban residents wanted to be employed and 13% of peri-urban and 22% of the urban wanted to continue working at the time of retirement. Fifty-two percent were suffering from hypertension and out of these 81% were on medication and of these 33% could not take drugs due to economic reasons. Their ailments included diabetes (15.6%), difficulty in walking (46.7%), vision disturbances (71.3%) and hearing loss. Seventy-three percent said that the health care services are present, but insufficient to deal with geriatric care (50%) and unsatisfactory (53%). There was a total lack of social services for elderly in the community. Conclusion: In the present cultural set up of Pakistan although the elderly are taken care of by their families but the majority want to continue working and be more independent. Most of the study population had one or the other form of ailment related to ageing which impaired their ADL indicator. There is extreme deficiency of health and social care services for the elderly hence the health care providers should start allocating and improvising for the specialized needs of the elderly. The social structure for elderly should be developed and jobs should also be created for the ones willing to continue working.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of causal attributions and budget emphasis on individuals' framing perceptions and risk preferences under conditions of unfavorable budget variances. Prospect theory maintains that risk preferences are domain-specific; individuals tend to be risk-averse in gains and risk-seeking in losses. Prior accounting research has found that while individual actions clearly reflect prospect theory propositions during situations of gain, individuals demonstrate risk indifference when faced with situations of loss. We investigate potential explanations for this lack of strict adherence to prospect theory during situations of loss. Our study uses internal and external attributions and pressure to meet budget targets for performance appraisals to create salient loss conditions. The results demonstrate that budget decisions vary depending on the casual factors of the unfavorable variance and on the degree of emphasis placed on achieving time budget targets. As expected, subjects exhibited relatively more risk seeking behavior when faced with internal attributions and when they expected a greater emphasis on meeting budgetary goals in performance assessment. Our results also demonstrate the importance of controlling for framing effects in prospect theory related tests. © 2000.\u001b[0m :\n",

This might affect the corporative and sectoral oriented government structure in Ireland, which was chosen as a test case for this study, with decision issues for plan periods 1988–93 and 1994–99. In this paper we focus on the question whether actors with high effective power do also sustain relatively small utility losses with respect to decision outcomes. This is done in terms of a collective decision model simultaneously involving multiple actors as well as multiple issues, using linear models specifying the basic model variables of collective decision modelling. The results show that effective power does not have a direct effect in isolation, but shows strong effects in specific interaction with other factors, characterising the decision contexts as they evolve over time. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study contrasts expected utility theory in the form of modern portfolio theory (MPT) with a descriptive psychological analysis in the form of prospect theory. For local government investment managers, the assumptions underlying MPT are violated in the manner predicted by prospect theory. Findings confirm the notion that local government investment managers are risk-averse when facing an investment gain and risk-seeking when facing an investment loss. Although a number of researchers have appealed to prospect theory to explain firm and industry risk patterns, the utility of prospect theory in public sector organizations is questioned. This study finds that irrespective of their personal disposition toward risk, local government chief investment officers defer to a compelling public interest when making investment decisions for their organization. © 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Generally, it is a difficult problem to adjust different claims of different interested parties in the process of large-scale and long-term infrastructure development project. Various parties are often in a social conflict with each other concerning their gain and loss that are brought about by the project. Such a social conflict is sometimes observed in a water resource development project that aims at construction of a dam, a river mouth weir, a reservoir, an irrigation canal and so on. Game theory is instrumental to analyze a social conflict to predict possible consequences and furthermore to suggest rational solutions for each interested party that is referred to as a player in the theory. It is assumed in the game theory that each player has one or more options to be taken and each possible consequence is a unique combination of options each player has taken. Among possible consequences, special attention should be paid to equilibrium solutions, that is, a consequence in which each player could only expect decrease of gain even by altering its own option alone unless other players would change their options. The present study depends on a game-theoretical method called conflict analysis that will be introduced in details later. At the same time, the study focuses on a dynamical aspect, that is, longitudinal change of psychological attitude each player has toward the project. The aspect has not been successfully taken into consideration in the game-theoretical perspective so far. Actually, it is often that each player changes its attitude during the long-term project. For example, an initial plan of a project that was once assumed rational for each player and thus also rational for a group of residents living near the project site and participating in the conflict as a player sometimes becomes irrational for the residents because of their change of attitude that has been caused by the passage of time, social influence of other players, environmental changes in the site and so on. The present study develops a behavioral decision model to formulate the change of attitude of each player by a set of differential equations. In the model, two important assumptions are set. First assumption is that a player goes back and forth between two states with some probability. In one of states, a player remembers an event that triggered the project, a natural disaster in many cases, and in another, a player forgets the event. Second assumption is that each player's attitude tends to be affected by the options that were taken by the other players. © 2000, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

      "Abstract: We analyze why some firms advertise product quality at a level different from the actual quality of a product. By considering the interacting effects of product quality and advertising, we develop a dynamic model of consumer expectations about product quality and the development of brand goodwill to determine the optimal values for the decision variables. The model parameters are determined based on prior literature and we use numerical techniques to arrive at the solution. We then derive conditions under which a firm will find it optimal to overstate or understate product quality. The results suggest that quality may be overstated in markets characterized by high price sensitivity, low quality sensitivity, low brand loyalty, and high source credibility, suggesting the need for vigilance on the part of consumers, upper level managers and regulatory authorities in such market conditions. This is important because current regulatory resources are insufficient to reduce deceptive advertising practices (Davis JJ. 1994. Ethics in advertising decision-making: implications for reducing the incidence of deceptive advertising. Journal of Consumer Affairs 28: 380–402). Further, the law of deceptive advertising prohibits some advertising claims on the ground that they are likely to harm consumers or competitors (Preston IL, Richards JI. 1993. A role for consumer belief in FTC and Lanham Act deceptive advertising cases. American Business Law Journal 31: 1–29). Also, Nagler (1993. Rather bait than switch: deceptive advertising with bounded consumer rationality. Journal of Public Economics 51: 359–378) shows that deceptive advertising causes a net social welfare loss and a public policy effectively preventing deception will improve social welfare.

      "Abstract: The market activities of international firms are now in unstable markets. Their decisions on how to act in such markets depend on their expectations of the future. The aim of this paper is to analyse the process of change in the expectations of a Swedish firm operating in the Russian market and facing dramatic market changes. To study the expectation behaviour of the firm, a longitudinal method covering the period from 1986 to 1993 is employed. The paper examines the expectation change process and the way the firm builds up its future market operation in order to penetrate, expand, and then exit from the Russian market. The absence of stability forced the firm to function either without any experiential knowledge or with knowledge that constantly lost its value. The thrust of this paper is grounded in the explanation that the basis of market activities rests on three forms of expectations: institutional, relationship, and network. The expectation view captured in the study is process-based and was explored through the concepts of commitment and knowledge from the internationalisation process model. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although the majority of pain complaints, in Australia, are among the elderly population, the focus of treatment is not on this age group. In order to achieve effective management of elderly people's chronic pain, their perspective of pain and coping strategies used needs to be understood. This qualitative study explored the preferred strategies of elderly people and the barriers they encountered in trying to manage their pain. Elderly people (n = 72) with chronic pain, over 65 years of age and living in the community, were interviewed for the study. Data were collected using six focus group and 12 in-depth interviews and a biographical questionnaire. Preferred coping strategies were those that could be self-administered and included both physical and cognitive elements. Elderly people wished to be active in their treatment, make informed choices and were willing to try new methods. Least-preferred strategies were the conventional treatments of medications, exercise and physiotherapy. Many barriers have to be overcome to achieve relief for their pain such as cost, access to health care, related disorders, attitudes of health professionals, lack of communication and fear of losing independence. Health professionals need to be aware of elderly people's perspective of pain and their preferred strategies and reasons for these choices. Health services must meet their specific needs.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The paper considers the context of leisure work for senior personnel in four sectors. The contention is that senior pe rsonnel in the British ‘leisure industries’ (Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure) find it difficult to be ‘at leisure’ predominately because of the attachment and re sponsibility they feel to their occupations. The impact of technology, of the dominant work discourse and a subsequent externalization of work are all considered. Spontaneity in activity is the most obvious loss for senior leisure industry personnel, exacerbated for women with young families, as the social organization of time privileges work time over family and leisure time. Contradictions are noted in those providing leisure opportunities for others experiencing little leisure of their own. What leisure they do experience is conside red under the banner of ‘real or apparent’ leisure. The paper discusses the implications for the leisure industry, especially the potential problems faced in promoting their industry as a career choice that offe rs freedom, action, excitement and achievement and escape from the mundane drudgery and boredom of conventional work. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Little is known about how audit partners make the client-acceptance decision. In this paper, a model is developed and tested that characterizes the client-acceptance decision as a process of risk evaluation and risk adaptation. The model proposes that auditors will evaluate client-related risks (e.g., financial viability, and internal control) and use that evaluation to determine if the audit firm will suffer a loss on the engagement via a lack of engagement profitability or future litigation. The model proposes that auditors will adapt to the client-acceptance risks by using three strategies: (1) screening clients based on their risk characteristics; (2) screening clients based on the audit firm's risk of loss on the engagement; and (3) more proactively adapting using strategies including adjusting the audit fee, making plans about necessary audit evidence, making plans about personnel assignment, and/or adjusting the amount of data collected during the client-acceptance process. To test the model, an experiment was conducted using 137 highly experienced audit partners as participants. The results show that the partners considered the relationships between client-related risks and used their evaluation of those risks to evaluate the audit firm's risk of loss on the engagement. In terms of risk adaptation, partners screened clients based on the clients' risk characteristics and based on the audit firm's risk of loss on the engagement. Contrary to prediction, the partners did not use more proactive risk-adaptation strategies (e.g., adjusting the audit fee, making plans about necessary audit evidence, etc.) to make less \"acceptable\" clients more acceptable. It appears that avoiding risk, rather than proactively adapting to risk, is descriptive of how audit partners currently make the client-acceptance decision.\u001b[0m :\n",

Based on this and other principles such as reference dependence and loss aversion, researchers have derived and demonstrated mental accounting (MA) rules for multiple outcome situations. Experiment 1 tested the invariance of the desired wealth principle and two mental accounting rules (mixed gain, e.g. $100 gain and a $50 loss; mixed loss, e.g. $100 loss and a $50 gain) across types of decision maker and frame. The desired wealth principle and the MA rule for mixed gains were found to vary depending upon (1) the thoughtfulness of the decision maker (need for cognition, NC), and (2) the frame used to describe gains and losses (e.g. a gain of $x versus a gain of y%). The MA rule for mixed losses, however, was found to be immune to framing effects, even among people who are generally less thoughtful. The differential processing of gains and losses across frames (dollar versus percentage) and individuals (less versus more thoughtful) was tested further in Experiment 2 where evaluations of mixed losses were made at the level of the gestalt as well as the constituent (the gain and the loss being evaluated separately). Framing effects were evidenced only among subjects lower in NC and only when the constituent gain was evaluated. Evaluations of the overall mixed loss and the constituent loss were comparable across situation and individual, suggesting that losses motivate greater processing among people otherwise inclined toward cognitive miserliness.

      "Abstract: The paper reports the results of an experiment on individual investors' risk perception in a financial decision making context under two different modes of information presentation (framings). One way to reduce the complexity of a risky decision situation is to focus on risk measures, e.g. the statistical moments of a risky alternative's distribution. There is a huge number of propositions about which risk measure is to be used from a theoretical point of view. Many of these models are based on the variance as risk measure. But since the symmetrical nature of variance does not capture the common notion of risk as something undesired there has been much discontent with this approach. More recently, lower partial moments (LPMs) have been rediscovered as a more suitable risk measure. They reflect the popular negative meaning of risk since they only take negative deviations from a reference point to measure risk. The purpose of this paper is to examine experimentally people's risk perception in a financial context. The focus is on the correspondence of risk perceptions with specific LPMs. The main findings can be summarized as follows. First, symmetrical risk measures like variance can be clearly dismissed in favor of shortfall measures like LPMs. Second, the reference point (target) of individuals for defining losses is not a distribution's mean but the initial price in a time series of stock prices. Third, the LPM which explains risk perception best is the LPM0, i.e. the probability of loss. Fourth, the framing of price distributions (histograms versus charts) exerts a significance influence on average risk ratings, the latter being higher for the histogram framing. Fifth, positive deviations from an individual reference point tend to decrease perceived risk. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents a series of experiments that confront subjects with low probability, high loss situations. A rich parameter set is examined and we find subjects respond to low probability, high loss risks in predictable ways. As loss events become more likely, or loss amounts get larger, or the cost of insurance falls, subjects are more likely to buy indemnifying insurance, even for the class of low probability risks that usually presents problems for standard expected utility theory. A novel application of Cameron's method to estimate willingness to pay from dichotomous choice responses allows us to estimate willingness to pay for insurance.

This model, cumulative prospect theory (CPT), as well as related models proposed by other authors, has received wide acclaim. Available information and psychological attitude facing ambiguity jointly determine the subjective likelihood values the decision maker attributes to events, expressed by either one of two capacities depending on the prospect of either gains or losses; unfortunately, neither interpretation of these capacities nor prevision of their links are straightforward. An insight into these issues is given by studying consistency of CPT with certain generalized expected utility models, when faced with objective data described by lower-upper probability intervals. Means of testing the existence of subjectively lower-upper probabilized events are obtained, as well as means of evaluating ambiguity aversion. © Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Malaysian environmental professionals were surveyed to determine their outlook on key environmental issues related to Malaysia and to the world. Learning about environmental perceptions from local decision makers was seen as important because of the rapid economic growth of Malaysia and because of concern that this development may result in the loss of a high-quality tropical environment. Study data should be useful in providing understanding of values relating to environmental management within the country. Results showed that air pollution and waste management were perceived of as key local environmental issues, with industrial air emissions and vehicular exhaust two of the major sources of local environmental degradation. Air pollution may be the more difficult of these problems to solve, perhaps conflicting with economic development interests. Loss of critical habitat, ozone depletion and climate change were viewed as important to global-scale environmental conditions, although habitat destruction was seen as somewhat less important to the local situation. River pollution was identified as the major ecological problem in Malaysia, although drinking water quality was not seen as a critical issue. Malaysian environmental professionals' perceptions of global-scale environmental problems are consistent with much of the international environmental community, knowledge that should be helpful in negotiating future international agreements. © 2000 National Association of Environmental Professionals.\u001b[0m :\n",

Consequently, the agent’s preference order will be viewed as depending on his initial situation, and on asymmetric sensitivity to gains and losses, relative to this situation. This leads 1) to discuss the coexistence of multiple preference orders, illustrated by Bentham's analysis of the optimal labour contract; and 2) to introduce true deliberation as a consequence of the gap between positive choice and rival assessments of utility. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent research indicates that attributes vary along multiple dimensions with implications for how trade-offs are resolved during choice. We present an exploratory study of the dimensionality underlying naïve subjects' ratings of attributes on the characteristics commonly discussed in the literature on tradeoff resolution and decision difficulty. Factor analysis of attribute characteristic assessments indicates that subjects view decision attributes in a multi-dimensional fashion, including an importance/loss aversion dimension, an emotional potential/protection from tradeoffs dimension, and a cognitive difficulty dimension. These results suggest that a one-dimensional measure of attribute characteristics, such as a standard attribute importance rating, may obscure some factors determining individual responses to attributes during decision processing. However, the results also suggest that developing a relatively succinct set of scales in order to characterize the dimensions along which subjects respond to attributes is a viable goal for future research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article links recent work on assimilative and contrastive counterfactual thinking with research on the impact of accountability on judgment and choice. Relative to participants who felt accountable solely for bottom-line performance outcomes, participants who were accountable for their decision-making process (a) had more pronounced differential reactions to clearly winning versus (winning but) nearly losing and to clearly losing versus (losing but) nearly winning; (b) were less satisfied with the quality of their decisions when they nearly lost and more satisfied with the quality of their decisions when they nearly won; and (c) invested less money into investments that nearly failed and more money into investments that nearly succeeded. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that process accountability amplified assimilative counterfactual thinking, whereas outcome accountability attenuated it. The evidence underscores the power of contextual features of the decision-making environment to shape key cognitive and affective consequences of upward and downward counterfactual comparisons.\u001b[0m :\n",

In the current study, an improved experimental design is employed to evaluate utility theory. The current study provides further evidence against the GUT class of models for mixed gambles.

      "Abstract: Changes within an individual's personal network may reflect either non-deliberate endings, such as loss, or active choice of social partners. This research explores to what extent perceptions of limited future time are associated with deliberate endings of social relationships and active maximization of intrinsic benefits in one's personal network. In a longitudinal follow-up study, the personal networks of 206 older adults aged between 70 and 103 years were assessed twice within a 4-year time interval. Change of personal networks and change within social relationships were explored in association with age cohort, subjective health, cognitive functioning, neuroticism, extraversion, and subjective nearness to death. Most changes within personal networks occurred in less close relationships, while close emotional relationships proved stable. More than half of discontinued relationships were ended for deliberate reasons. Within ongoing social relationships, emotional closeness after 4 years was improved when social partners were family members and emotional supporters (e.g. confidants). When older adults felt near to death, emotional closeness with others decreased, except within relationships with family members and with social companions. The findings suggest that individuals actively shape the compositions of their personal networks in order to maximize the availability of intrinsic and extrinsic benefits from others.\u001b[0m :\n",

Four experiments examine the recent discovery that the focus on actions in the short term switches to inactions in the long term. The experiments show that this temporal switch occurs only for particular sorts of situations. Experiment 1 showed no temporal pattern to the agency effect when 112 participants judged emotional impact and frequency of \"if-only\" thoughts from both short- and long-term perspectives for an investment scenario. Experiment 2 showed no temporal pattern when 190 participants considered a college choice scenario with a good outcome. Experiment 3 showed no temporal pattern when 131 participants considered an investment scenario even when the situation for the actor and nonactor was bad from the outset. Experiment 4, with 113 participants, showed a focus on actions even when the investment loss was equal for both the actor and nonactor. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of what is explicitly available in the mental representation of actions and inactions.\u001b[0m :\n",

Unfortunately, the literature has neglected task factors specific to foreign policy decisions. This paper presents experimental analyses of the effects of the decisional stakes (i.e., salience of the values at issue) and threat (risk of loss on those issues) on decision-makers' information acquisition patterns and choice rules with respect to one of four hypothetical foreign policy scenarios. Contrary to the notion that normative (rational) decision-making is more likely in less dramatic settings, the results indicate that elevated threat encourages rational decision processing, whereas heuristic processing was more prevalent in less threatening situations. Interestingly, the added presence of high stakes magnified both threat effects. These results, although preliminary, suggest that stakes-threat effects are not direct reflections of stress and/or complexity effects, but should be considered independently in foreign policy analyses.\u001b[0m :\n",

But action bias arises if that penchant is carried over to areas where those reasons do not apply, hence is nonrational. Action bias is explored theoretically, and then empirically, using data from surveys of hypothetical environmental decisions. Quite apart from agency considerations, individuals like to affect outcomes when gains are reaped. Given the ability to help one of two sites, we find that decision makers choose to foster improvement rather than prevent deterioration, despite framing that makes it arbitrary which site is improved, which preserved. Strong action bias - individuals choosing to reap gains even though they must impose losses - is also observed.

Thorp, 1966] and card counting), people exhibit departures from rationality (e.g., \"Never Bust\" strategies). To determine whether departures from rational behavior reflect ignorance or fatigue, university students were provided with on-line Basic advice while playing a simplified computer blackjack. Although the on-line advice initially affected the totals these players sat on, it was eventually discarded for higher risk strategies. Irrational play did not reflect ignorance or fatigue and was not necessarily conservative. Real fluctuations of odds in blackjack may lead to situations in which Basic is not perceived by players as effective. Because Basic is not a personalized strategy, it seems less likely to be maintained in the face of losses.

The conditions of this study more closely modeled studies with nonhumans responding for food than studies with humans making decisions about hypothetical monetary amounts. Consistent with previous data, subjects displayed a strong preference for the non-risky response alternative, even when doing so resulted in lost earnings.

Although incentive contracts exist that prevent cascades, in some cases these contracts do not maximize shareholders' expected residual value and cascades are tolerated in equilibrium. Cascades never occur in hierarchies that exogenously prevent communication. However, when the firm is organized as a hierarchy (and the agents are given the optimal hierarchical contract), in some cases agents will collude and sequentially communicate, admitting the possibility of cascades. In these cases, the principals must monitor and enforce the hierarchical process. When monitoring costs exceed the cost of cascades, the team is the optimal organizational form.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A dimensional model of perceived risk and a model of risk acceptance based on risk rates are proposed in this paper. In line with the proposed model of perceived risk, risk is a linear combination of the three basic dimensions of a risky situation: the amount and probability of loss and the amount of gain. It is assumed that psychological transformations are made on these dimensions. According to the model of acceptance, acceptance is judged by making a trade-off between perceived risk and the amount of gain. These models have been investigated in two experiments, in which risk judgments and acceptance rates for a set of descriptions of risky investments were collected from managers in Poland. The proposed dimensional model of perceived risk was compared to the distributional models of risk and to the risk models based on the expectation principle. The best fit was obtained for the proposed model. It was also found that perceived risk was useful in predicting acceptance rates. Better fits were obtained for the models of acceptance, based on perceived risk, than for the expected/weighted utility models, including bilinear models. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: Recent work in marketing has drawn on behavioral decision theory to advance the notion that consumers evaluate attributes (and therefore choice alternatives) not only in absolute terms, but as deviations from a reference point. The theory has important substantive and practical implications for the timing and execution of price promotions and other marketing activities. Choice modelers using scanner panel data have tested for the presence of these \"reference effects\" in consumer response to an attribute such as price. In applications of the theory of reference-dependent choice (Tversky and Kahneman 1991), some modelers report empirical evidence of loss aversion: When a consumer encounters a price above his or her established reference point (a \"loss\"), the response is greater than for a price below the reference point (a \"gain\"). Researchers have gone so far as to suggest that evidence for the so-called reference effect make it an empirical generalization in marketing (e.g., Kalyanaram and Winer 1995, Meyer and Johnson 1995). It is our contention that the measurement of loss aversion in empirical applications of the reference-dependent choice model is confounded by the presence of unaccounted-for heterogeneity in consumer price responsiveness. Our reasoning is that the kinked price response curve implied by loss aversion is confounded with the slopes of the response curves across segments that are differentially responsive to price. A more price-responsive consumer (with a steeper response function) tends to have a lower price level as a reference point. This consumer faces a larger proportion of prices above his reference point, thus the response curve is steeper in the domain of losses. Similarly, the less price-responsive consumer sees a greater proportion of prices below his reference point, so the response curve is less steep within the domain of gains. As a result, any cross-sectional estimate of loss aversion that does not take this into account will be biased upward - researchers who do not control for heterogeneity in price responsiveness may arrive at incorrect substantive conclusions about the phenomenon. It is interesting to note that in this instance, failure to control for heterogeneity induces a bias in favor of finding an effect, rather than the more typical case of attenuation of the effect toward zero. We first test our assertion regarding the referencedependent model using scanner panel data on refrigerated orange juice and subsequently extend this analysis to 11 additional product categories. In all cases we find, as predicted, that accounting for price-response heterogeneity leads to lower and frequently nonsignificant estimates of loss aversion. We do, however, find some categories in which the effect does not disappear altogether. We also estimate loss aversion using a \"sticker shock\" model of brand choice in which the reference prices are brand-specific. In line with the results of the majority of prior literature, we find smaller and insignificant estimates of loss aversion in this model. We show that this is because in the sticker shock model, there is no apparent correlation between the price responsiveness of the consumer and the representation of reference effects as losses or gains. Our findings strongly suggest that loss aversion may not in fact be a universal phenomenon, at least in the context of frequently purchased grocery products.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study estimates the effect of a sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) population management plan on both the sea lion population and the associated squid (Nototodarus sloanii) fishery. The goal of the management plan is to rebuild the sea lion population and involves closing the squid fishery when a threshold level of sea lions have been caught. The threshold level is calculated from a generalized simulation analysis which conservatively allows for adequate population rebuilding for a number of different species and populations. Our analysis uses Bayesian theory to describe uncertainty in the sea lion population size and squid catch under the implementation of the management plan. The priors represent this particular sea lion population, and the analysis represents expectation rather than calculating conservative levels of safe fishing-related mortality. The results show that the squid catch is very sensitive to whether or not the squid fishery is closed when it exceeds the threshold level for sea lion bycatch. The sea lion population size is much less sensitive to the closure of the squid fishery. For an economically important fishery, the estimates of uncertainty in both loss of catch and increase in sea lion population are needed to allow informed decision-making about trade-offs between sea lion conservation and full exploitation of the fishery.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the relationship among demographic data, anxiety, significant losses, depression, and irrational beliefs reported by first- offence shoplifters. Method: One hundred and six adult shoplifters who were first-time offenders completed a self-administered questionnaire. Results: Men and women were equally likely to be arrested for this offence. The majority of offenders were poor and unemployed. Depression, but not anxiety, was the most common psychiatric disorder associated with shoplifting. Subjects with depression presented the greatest number of irrational beliefs related to shoplifting. Conclusions: The authors suggest 2 categories of shoplifters: those who shoplift through rational choice; and those for whom shoplifting is a response to depression or leads to the fulfilment of some psychological needs. In conclusion, shoplifting does not have a unitary motive, and the clinical implications are that the affective and cognitive aspects of shoplifters' behaviours must be taken into account.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We present an alternative abstraction of an English (oral ascending) auction to the standard, in Milgrom and Weber (1982), that accords more closely with practices in some auction markets. In particular, the assumptions that exits are irrevocable and necessarily public are dropped, making endogenous the decision to compete silently and privately, or openly. In the model, the price rises in a stylization of an auctioneer alternately recognizing two bidders who affirm willingness to pay the current price. The auctioneer pays attention to other bidders only when a recognized bidder exits. Such exits may be temporary, although we construct an equilibrium in which there is no benefit to exit and reentry. The number of public exits is stochastic; frequently a losing \"bidder\" will remain silent, giving no indication of his willingness to pay, and hence yielding no useful inference about his private information. Thus, the source of the expected revenue advantage of English auctions over second-price auctions is only stochastically available. Moreover, when public exits are incomplete, the ordinal rank of the bidder whose private information can be inferred is unknown, making that information less valuable. Consequently, the simpler formula for expected revenue in second-price auctions may be the preferred approximation for English auctions.

      "Abstract: Background. The nicotine transdermal patch (NTP) has been shown previously to be a cost-effective smoking cessation intervention. This is the first economic analysis comparing the NTP with the only non-nicotine- containing pharmacological intervention, bupropion HCl. Methods. Decision- tree analysis, based on a previously published cost-benefit smoking-cessation model, was used to determine the optimal treatment from the standpoint of costs versus benefits, from the employer's perspective. Base-case probabilities of successful quitting in our model came from clinical trial point-prevalence data at the end of a 1-year follow-up study (N = 893) comparing placebo, bupropion, NTP, and bupropion/NTP in combination, administered along with minimal counseling. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the effects of variations in base-case assumptions regarding the monetary benefits that would accrue if an intervention were successful, probabilities of quitting, drug costs, cost of lost work time for a health care provider visit, and cost of the visit itself. Results. The analysis showed that bupropion is more cost-beneficial than either NTP or bupropion/NTP, with a net benefit in the first post-quit year of up to $338 per employee who attempts to quit compared with $26 for NTP, $178 for the two in combination, and $258 for placebo. These results were robust to most plausible variations in the assumptions used in the model. One exception was the monetary benefit of successful intervention (assumed in the base-case to be $1,654). If this benefit were actually less than $1,112, placebo (i.e., minimal counseling with no pharmacological intervention) would be more cost- beneficial than any of the active treatments. Conclusion. From an employer's perspective, bupropion 300 mg/day for 9 weeks is a more cost-beneficial smoking cessation intervention than the nicotine patch, and under most scenarios, bupropion is also more cost-beneficial than placebo.

      "Abstract: In the newsvendor problem a decision maker orders inventory before a one period selling season with stochastic demand. If too much is ordered, stock is left over at the end of the period, whereas if too little is ordered, sales are lost. The expected profit-maximizing order quantity is well known, but little is known about how managers actually make these decisions. We describe two experiments that investigate newsvendor decisions across different profit conditions. Results from these studies demonstrate that choices systematically deviate from those that maximize expected profit. Subjects order too few of high-profit products and too many of low-profit products. These results are not consistent with risk-aversion, risk-seeking preferences, Prospect Theory preferences, waste aversion, stockout aversion, or the consequences of underestimating opportunity costs. Two explanations are consistent with the data. One, subjects behave as if their utility function incorporates a preference to reduce ex-post inventory error, the absolute difference between the chosen quantity and realized demand. Two, subjects suffer from the anchoring and insufficient adjustment bias. Feedback and training did not mitigate inventory order errors. We suggest techniques to improve decision making.\u001b[0m :\n",

This review considers the psychological outcomes for parents whether they opt to terminate the pregnancy or continue, either through choice or because termination is not an option. It covers the full spectrum of malformation from treatable, through those carrying a risk of significant handicap, to lethal. It draws on two types of studies: those that are retrospective and qualitative, describing feelings and aspects of care, and those that are prospective and assess psychological state with standardized measures of grief, anxiety and depression. The relationship between psychological outcome and possible associated variables, such as individual characteristics, nature of the abnormality and obstetric factors is described and evaluated.

      "Abstract: Background: Disinhibited, antisocial traits increase the risk for early- onset alcoholism. Research also suggests that decision biases which favor immediate large rewards regardless of long-term consequences may be important mechanisms associated with the biological substrates of antisocial traits. This study tested the hypothesis that early-onset alcoholism with antisocial personality (ASP) would be associated with favoring immediate larger rewards despite their being associated with long-term losses. Methods: Twenty-seven early-onset alcoholics with and without a diagnosis of ASP, eight subjects with ASP but no alcohol dependence, and 32 controls were tested on a task that manipulated the magnitude of immediate rewards and the magnitude of long-term punishments. The sample was recruited from the community via advertisements. Results: Compared with subjects without ASP, subjects with ASP favored larger immediate rewards despite long-term losses regardless of alcohol dependence; however, they learned to shift their decisions in a more advantageous direction over time. A disadvantageous decision bias also was associated with drinking greater quantities of alcohol and having a lower IQ. Conclusions: This study suggests that ASP in a young adult noninstitutionalized sample was associated with a pattern of disadvantageous decision making similar to that observed in patients with antisocial behavioral characteristics associated with lesions in the ventromedial frontal cortex. The data also suggest that this pattern of disadvantageous decision making is associated with consuming larger quantities of alcohol but not consuming alcohol more frequently.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the perceived relative worth of reaching and maintaining a self-selected goal weight, for obese and non-obese individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Twenty-five obese treatment-seekers (age 41.0 y, BMI 42.5) and a community sample of 31 obese (age 40.8 y, BMI 32.2) and 64 non-obese participants (age 32.4 y, BMI 23.4). MEASUREMENT: An 18-item forced-choice questionnaire evaluating what participants would hypothetically sacrifice to reach and maintain their goal weight. RESULTS: Most obese treatment-seekers would hypothetically endure much to achieve their desired weight. For example, 88% or more would forego a job promotion, retiring with full-pay, eliminating the national debt, or winning their dream house or car or an all-expense-paid vacation, and smaller majorities would suffer loss of half their income or a job demotion. Many non-treatment-seeking obese would forfeit future rewards to reach goal weight, but fewer would incur negative events. About a third of non-obese participants would forgo certain positive events, but few would suffer an adverse event to achieve goal weight. Within the combined obese sample, females viewed attaining goal weight as more important than did males, but there were no significant racial differences. An index of overall worth of weight goal was related positively to current weight and BMI and negatively to goal weight as percentage of current weight (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Excessive value may be placed on attaining less than realistic weight goals, particularly but not exclusively by treatment-seeking and heavier obese people and those who desire greater weight loss. Clinicians should take this phenomenon into consideration, and public health initiatives should attempt to place body weight in a more balanced perspective.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Loss of rainforest occurs in part because of a global market failure problem. Markets routinely transmit signals about international demands for forest products such as timber, but fail to transmit signals about demands for preservation. To make efficient resource allocation choices, decision makers need some framework to estimate the non-use values that might be held by an international community for rainforest preservation. Non-market valuation techniques can be used for this purpose, but framing and other problems limit the application of the contingent valuation method (CVM). An alternative technique, choice modelling (CM), appears to hold some promise because it can be used to model complex situations and to frame choices consistent with 'real life' choices. In this paper a CM experiment to assess the values that Australians hold for rainforest conservation in Vanuatu is reported. The experiment disguises effectively the issue of interest, rainforest conservation in Vanuatu, within a pool of other conservation locations. Also, the experiment demonstrates that choice tradeoffs may involve a variety of environmental and socio-economic factors, rather than be concentrated on some monetary tradeoff. The results demonstrate that a variety of predictive and valuation tools can be gained from a CM experiment, and suggest that further development is warranted. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Floods are among the most costly natural disasters in terms of human sufferings and economic losses in Bangladesh. Approximately 20% of the country experiences normal annual flooding while all the historical catastrophic floods inundated more than fifty percent of the country's total area. The recent flood in 1998 has been found to be more severe than all previous floods. During the flooding season of 1998, the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center (FFWC) of the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) prepared daily flood bulletin and incorporated information about rainfall, rise/fall of river water, flood forecasting for 24 and 48 hr in advance and warning messages (if any). The FFWC attempted to provide adequate services to the local and national level decision-making process. The forecasting procedure adapted by the FFWC was based on hydrological information, forecaster's experience, and model simulation. This paper primarily examines the role and activities of the FFWC, especially in flood forecasting and warning. Identification of the causes and consequences of 1998 flood is the other pertinent area of discussion of the paper. Findings of this research revealed that the flood of 1998 was caused by heavy downpour in the upstream that was drained out through the major rivers in Bangladesh. Three major rivers' peak was synchronized and characterized it as the most prolonged flood in the history of Bangladesh. It also revealed that, despite various limitations, the flood forecasts of the FFWC were reasonably adequate to meet national demand during the crises of 1998.\u001b[0m :\n",

Some measures have been suggested to prevent losses or discourage unethical behavior. One approach is to identify factors that might better explain acceptable/unacceptable actions. In this study, we examined models of ethical behavior and selected factors from these models that might influence decision-making. We conducted an empirical study to determine perceptions of acceptable or unacceptable behavior and which factors were significant in influencing a person's judgment of acceptable/unacceptable behavior. Identifying the factors that influence ethical decision-making is one approach suggested by researchers to find ways to discourage unethical behavior and help businesses prevent losses. The results of the study indicate there are significant factors that affected individuals' assessment of what is acceptable behavior. The results also indicate that the factors which were influential were contingent on the characteristics of the ethical dilemma.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe circumstances of death among in-patients on an aged care ward, and to determine decisional capacity and pain relief requirements at end-of-life. DESIGN: Prospective audit by medical staff of all deaths within a 66 bed unit from January 1996 to October 1998. Two-monthly case review utilizing a standardized assessment. RESULTS: 170 deaths occurred over 34 months: 93 males, 77 females. 105 patients (62%) were designated definitely incompetent in terms of decisional capacity. In this group, excluding cases where patients died suddenly (6/105), primary decision-makers were next-of-kin in 81/99 (82%) of cases and medical staff in 18/99 (18%) of cases. Of the 57 patients who were assessed as competent, 8 died suddenly. Of the remaining 49 patients in this group, decisions regarding end-of-life management were made by patients in 36 (73%) cases, next-of-kin in 10 (20%) cases, and by medical staff in 3 (6%) of cases. Analgesia for pain/symptom control was required in 110 (65%) of patients, and was assessed as adequate in 108 (98%). There were no requests for euthanasia in this group. CONCLUSIONS: Mental incompetence and loss of decisional capacity occurred in the majority of hospitalized elderly patients with life-threatening illness. In this setting, substitute decision-makers were critically important at the end-of-life, acting as primary decision-makers in 82% of cases. Medical staff, by comparison, rarely fulfilled this role, Opiate analgesia was usually required for pain and symptom control in these patients, and pain control was assessed as successful in 98% of cases.\u001b[0m :\n",

The novelty of the method is that it is parameter-free, and thus elicits the whole individual preference functional without imposing any prior restriction. This method is used in an experimental study to elicit individual utility and probability weighting functions for monetary outcomes in the gain and loss domains. Concave utility functions are obtained for gains and convex utility functions for losses. The elicited weighting functions satisfy upper and lower subadditivity and are consistent with previous parametric estimations. The data also show that the probability weighting function for losses is more \"elevated\" than for gains.\u001b[0m :\n",

We extended the original research by examining the phenomenon in the domain of losses as well as in the domain of gains. A pattern consistent with the inaction inertia effect was found for gains but not for losses. We also manipulated the source of the second offer and found that evaluations of gains decreased after inaction regardless of source, but evaluations of losses increased when the second offer came from a different source. Evaluations of the offer were highly correlated with ratings of anticipated regret, suggesting that the avoidance of negative emotions may be partially responsible for the effect. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although various studies have shown that farmers believe there is the need for a producer-led initiative to address the environmental problems from agriculture, farmers in several Canadian provinces have been reluctant to widely participate in Environmental Farm Plan (EFP) programs. Few studies have examined the key issues associated with adopting EFP programs based on farmers', as opposed to policy makers', perspectives on why producers are reluctant to participate in the program. A study adapting Van Raaij's (1981) conceptual model of the decision-making environment of the firm, and prospect theory on value functions associated with the gains and losses from risky choices can be used to characterize how farmers perceive potential risks in environmental farm planning. This framework can be used to assert that farmers are concerned about risks of public disclosure of potentially incriminating environmental information from farms because the EFP program requirements for identification and extensive documentation of farm information is perceived by farmers as facilitating the accessibility of environmental information to the public, and public investigate efforts. Although the EFP program does not explicitly generate information about the environmental conditions of a farm nor the disclosure of such information to the public, it creates the possibility of generating and divulging potentially incriminating information that the farmer may want to treat as confidential. Yet, alone, these risks of public disclosure concerns should not prevent farmers from participating in the EFP. Awareness of and participation in environmental farm planning can be increased if farmers and policy makers understand what the risks are, and how they arise. Aspects of the EFP process that have the potential to generate risk of public disclosure concerns relate to farm reviews, documentation and record keeping, and corrective action plans. There are legal and policy instruments that can offer various forms of protection and help minimize such risks, and these need to be assessed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It has been postulated that changes in lifestyle follow five 'stages of change', which reflect a 'decisional balance' between the advantages and disadvantages of making such a change. We have assessed this model among Pacific Islands people in New Zealand. We questioned 105 Pacific Islands volunteers to identify their decisional balance for their reduction in dietary fat intake (DPI), weight control (WC) and the adoption of regular exercise habits (REH). Answers were used to develop a closed questionnaire, which was completed by a second group of 195 Pacific Islands volunteers. The major reported advantages were good health (45%) and increased physical attractiveness (41%) for WC; disease prevention (70%) for DPI; and increased fitness (71%) for REH. The major reported disadvantages were losing too much weight (40%) for WC; eating fatty foods was enjoyable (50%) for DPI; and the time required (47%) for REH. Major differences in responses were found by age, sex, Islands group and educational status. The derived decisional balance questions related to the stage of change with advantages outweighing disadvantages for those in the maintenance/action phases and the converse for those in the precontemplative phase. The use of this model will be helpful in evaluating long-term programs aimed at the primary prevention of non-insulin-dependent diabetes through lifestyle change.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Agent technology has been applied to design new services known as \"shopbots\" that simplify product and merchant brokering in several consumer industries. The use of shopbots is expected to reduce consumer search costs and make buying behavior more rational. Based upon a decision-making model, the author proposed 12 hypotheses pertaining to the effects of shopbot use on consumer buying behavior and tested them in an experiment in which consumers chose a financial-service provider. His hypotheses relating to changes in information-search behavior were strongly supported, but there was only partial support for the hypotheses on changes in choice behavior, and no evidence of differences at the problem-recognition and judgment stages of the buying process between consumers using shopbots and other consumers. Although this research was exploratory, the findings suggest that vendors of high-complexity products need not fear losing customers because of shopbot use. Since many customers perceive shopbots as value-added services that make information search on the Internet more satisfying, offering access to such services may help vendors to retain their customers.\u001b[0m :\n",

Results supported the hypotheses that (a) more risk seeking members are more likely to take the lead and (b) prototypical members are more likely to take the lead when the problem facing the group is ambiguous (i.e., when group risk preferences and decision framing are incongruent), whereas nonprototypical members are more likely to take the lead when the problem facing the group is relatively clear-cut (i.e., when group risk preferences and decision framing are congruent). © 2000 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The report, 'Valuation of the human cost factor of traffic accidents' (Ministry of Transport and Communications, Publication B 9/99), concluded that the current methods used in Finland for costing accidents are not theoretically completely valid and should be revised, along with estimating new respective unit values. Individual willingness to pay should be applied in order to capture the true nature of welfare impacts induced by accident risks and to quantify the lost quality of life in monetary units. Only those values that reflect subjective risk preferences represent the welfare consequences of accidents in an appropriate manner. The Finnish accident-costing system has been re-examined in this report, and a set of new unit costs proposed accordingly. For presenting the arguments behind the adopted method for costing risk values, a review of the valuation methodology and its economic welfare foundations has been presented. The material accident costs have been adjusted according to the 1987 inventory only by a price index to current day values. The production losses have been costed according to the theoretically correct net of personal consumption approach, based on 1998 data on Finnish national accounting. The other major change in the costing structure concerns the approach to valuing lost quality of life induced by personal injuries. As Finnish empirical risk value studies do not yet exist and there has been no time for conducting such a survey, the method of value transfer has been applied. Value transfers are commonly used in order to reduce the cost of arduous and time-consuming studies and to obtain information for decision-making with less research effort. The Swedish risk value representing the quality of life lost due to a fatality has been transferred directly to Finland. The values assigned for representing the quality of life lost due to non-fatal injuries has been scaled from the Swedish value of fatality according to the relative weights used in Norway. The reason for this is the similar injury severity classification used in Norway and Finland. Transferred values never fully correspond to values obtained by empirical risk valuation studies. Therefore, performing such a study is strongly recommended for the near future. Since the data behind the current real economic accident cost estimates is already rather old, also an inventory on the overall cost structure of accidents is recommended. If adopted into the decision-making system, the proposed new method adopted from contemporary accident costing literature and the unit values it produces, would clearly increase the emphasis given to human welfare impacts of traffic safety. This change simultaneously serves the purpose of directing more resources to implementing safety measures and policies. In particular, more emphasis would be given to the welfare impacts of minor injuries, which are rather often ignored in traffic safety discussions. These new unit costs would raise the figures representing the social cost of road transport, in particular, in Finland. Therefore, also the pressure on collecting the funds for covering the costs would rise. If the principles of full-cost pricing and user pays were be applied, these costs should be covered. The user-pays principle and pricing transport respectively initiate a change in people's behaviour. This means that accident costing would lead to such prices of travelling that reflect these costs, which then would be reduced by a change towards risk averse behaviour. Thus, by using the correct management tools, the number of accidents and their social and private costs would be eventually reduced.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Mangrove ecosystems are rapidly declining in many parts of the world. This has resulted in the loss of important environmental and economic products and services including forest products, flood mitigation and nursery grounds for fish. The aquaculture industry was the single biggest threat to mangroves in the Philippines until 1981 when conversion of the remaining mangrove stands was prohibited by law. However, the decreasing yield from capture fisheries is putting pressure for the re-examination of this policy. To understand the importance of mangroves, insight is needed into the value of products and services provided is needed. This article compares the costs and benefits of mangrove preservation with those generated by alternative uses such as aquaculture and forestry. Equity and sustainability objectives are taken into account, in addition to economic efficiency and analyzed according to the perspectives of the different types of decision makers involved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Utilities differ according to whether they are derived from risky (gamble) and riskless (visual analog scale, time-tradeoff) assessment methods. The discrepancies are usually explained by assuming that the utilities elicited by risky methods incorporate attitudes towards risk, whereas riskless utilities do not. In (cumulative) prospect theory, risk attitude is conceived as consisting of two components: a decision-weight function (attentiveness to changes in, or sensitivity towards, chance) and a utility function (sensitivity towards outcomes). The authors' data suggest that a framing effect is a hitherto unrecognized and important factor in causing discrepancies between risky and riskless utilities. They collected risky evaluations with the gamble method, and riskless evaluations with difference measurement. Risky utilities were derived using expected-utility theory and prospect theory. With the latter approach, sensitivity towards outcomes and sensitivity towards chance are modeled separately. When the hypothesis that risky utilities from prospect theory coincide with riskless utilities was tested, it was rejected (n = 8, F(1,7) = 132, p = 0.000), suggesting that a correction for sensitivity towards chance is not sufficient to resolve the difference between risky and riskless utilities. Next, it was assumed that different gain/loss frames are induced by risky and riskless elicitation methods, indeed, identical utility functions were obtained when the gain/loss frames were made identical across methods (n = 7), suggesting that framing was operative. The results suggest that risky and riskless utilities are identical after corrections for sensitivity towards chance and framing.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Human decision making under risk and uncertainty may depend on individual involvement in the outcome-generating process. Expected utility theory is silent on this issue. Prospect theory in its current form offers little, if any, prediction of how or why involvement in a process should matter, although it may offer ex post interpretations of empirical findings. Well-known findings in psychology demonstrate that when subjects exercise more involvement or choice in lottery procedures, they value their lottery tickets more highly. This often is interpreted as an 'illusion of control,' meaning that when subjects are more involved in a lottery, they may believe they are more likely to win, perhaps because they perceive that they have more control over the outcome. Our experimental design eliminates several possible alternative explanations for the results of previous studies in an experiment that varies the degree and type of involvement in lottery procedures. We find that in treatments with more involvement subjects on average place less rather than more value on their lottery tickets. One possible explanation for this is that involvement interacts with loss aversion by causing subjects to weigh losses more heavily than they would otherwise. One implication of our study is that involvement, either independently or in interaction with myopic loss aversion, may help explain the extreme risk aversion of bond investors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We evaluated the burden of Alport syndrome (AS) and the attitudes towards gene testing in patients with AS and their healthy family members from 37 families using a multiple-choice questionnaire. We also evaluated how the disease affected the decision to have children and the information received about the syndrome. A total of 53 individuals responded to this questionnaire. The risk of renal insufficiency and the uncertainty of the prognosis were considered the worst components of AS. Many of the respondents felt that children should be informed about AS as soon as they start asking (45%), preferably by a parent (74%). Almost all of the respondents (96%) had a positive attitude towards genetic research, which in the opinion of the majority should be aimed at better treatment and diagnosis of the disease rather than developing methods for prenatal diagnosis (89% and 75% versus 43%). AS seems to be well tolerated; 28% and 19% of the respondents found abortion acceptable in cases of an affected male and female fetus, respectively. Our study indicates a desire for prenatal tests in order to predict the health of a future child rather than for selective abortion.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The prefrontal cortex has traditionally been implicated in a variety of cognitive processes, including memory, attention and decision making. The detection of effects of prefrontal cortex lesions on attention has been shown to depend on the procedure used to assess the attentional process. We therefore investigated the effects of lesions of the prefrontal cortex in two different visual attention tasks, i.e. a three-choice serial reaction time task involving sustained and divided attention processes and a visual timing task involving sustained attention and response inhibition processes. In two rat strains that are frequently used in behavioural analysis, i.e. albino Wistar rats and pigmented Lister Hooded rats, lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex caused a deterioration of performance in both tasks, although the effect lasted much longer in the visual timing task. This latter task proved to be especially sensitive to detect the consequences of medial prefrontal cortex lesions, consisting of a loss of both attention control and response inhibition. In both attention tasks, Wistar rats performed less accurate and made more anticipatory responses than Listers. Strain differences could not entirely be attributed to possible visual deficits in albinos, which was also evident when locomotor activity in an open field and food-motivated behaviour in a hoarding paradigm were assessed. Due to slower habituation rates, Lister rats were more active and displayed little food hoarding behaviour. In Wistar rats, hoarding was disrupted by medial prefrontal cortex lesions, showing the effectiveness of the lesion. The results indicate that, although different rat strains provide different baseline levels of behaviour for testing lesion- or drug-induced behavioural changes, lesions of the medial prefrontal cortex do not only disrupt sustained attention processes, but also induce a strong impairment in response inhibition in both Wistar and Lister rats.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The preference-reversal, or the reflection, effect occurs when the valence of the decision option influences risk preference (A. Tversky and D. Kahneman, 1981). The present study examined 3 possible moderators of gambling choices - alcohol, gender, and sensation seeking - among 108 healthy male and female volunteers. After receiving a moderate dose of alcohol, a placebo, or a no-alcohol control beverage, participants completed a betting task in which they could risk a monetary bonus by selecting and playing out a potential gain and a potential loss. Results indicated a preference-reversal effect among high sensation seekers only. The finding that individual differences moderated gambling choices is more consistent with L. L. Lopes's (1987) security-potential/aspiration (SP/A) theory of decision making than with prospect theory. As in previous experimental studies, no significant effects were found for a moderate dose of alcohol. Using SP/A and risk homeostasis theory, the methodological and conceptual reasons for a consistent lack of an effect of alcohol on gambling choices across several studies are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although the Cold War is over, the dangers of international armed conflict remain. Multinational talks about restricting the arms trade stalled in 1992. If they resume, what should the British attitude be towards participation in a multilateral agreement to limit arms exports when such exports apparently make a significant contribution to the UK economy? Sensible public debates and choices need information on the likely economic impacts of alternative scenarios. This paper examines the likely effects of a one-third reduction in the value of UK arms exports. It finds that between 13,333 and 40,000 jobs would be lost and that of those that remain in the labour force over half will find new work within a year. The South-West would be the worst affected region losing 0.3 per cent of all jobs; defence sales would be cut by between 3 and 8 per cent; aerospace output would be cut by between 5 and 9 per cent, and total exports would fall by 0.5 per cent. There would be initial adverse effects but, over time, resources would be re-allocated to other industries and regions. © 1999, MCB UP Limited\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Primary losses like the death of a child can either be a growth or a destructive experience. This depends on certain internal and external circumstances (Sprang et al. 1989:159). Conway (1988:543-544) adds: \"Traumatic losses change one's life. Rather than undergoing a loss, grieving, then returning to their former level of functioning, people move to a new level of functioning that incorporates the loss and grieving experience.\" Most bereaved parents in this study were convinced that the intensity of the grieving experience decreases over time, although the intensity of the loss of a child is so strong for most parents that they can never be the same again. After the death of a child, changes normally take place in lifestyle and values and people learn that one cannot only endure separation, but that the mourning experience can lead to a new level of self-awareness and values (Kast 1988:135). Any crisis gives the opportunity for growth (Sawicki 1988:84) and it depends on the person himself what he makes of the situation. It is important that the bereaved parent should make a choice for life. This has to be a purposeful decision instead of just being dragged through life. It is of special importance not to keep on living in the past and to make a definite decision for the future, although parents may not feel like carrying on. If a person can work through these choices, a new quality can be attained in the individual's life.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent findings with clinically oriented neuropsychological tests suggest that one night without sleep causes particular impairment to tasks requiring flexible thinking and the updating of plans in the light of new information. This relatively little investigated field of sleep deprivation research has real-world implications for decision makers having lost a night's sleep. To explore this latter perspective further, we adapted a dynamic and realistic marketing decision making \"game\" embodying the need for these skills, and whereby such performance could be measured. As the task relied on the comprehension of a large amount of written information, a critical reasoning test was also administered to ascertain whether any failure at the marketing game might lie with information acquisition rather than with failures in decision making. Ten healthy highly motivated and trained participants underwent two counterbalanced 36 h trials, sleep vs no sleep. The critical reasoning task was unaffected by sleep loss, whereas performance at the game significantly deteri orated after 32-36 h of sleep loss, when sleep deprivation led to more rigid thinking, increased perseverative errors, and marked difficulty in appreciating an updated situation. At this point, and despite the sleep-deprived participants' best efforts to do well, their play collapsed, unlike that of the nonsleep-deprived participants. © 1999 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We optimize the trade-off between economic and ecological concerns in conservation biology by using a novel method to link a spatially explicit individual-based model to a dynamic programming model. To date, few optimality models have been presented to optimize this trade-off, especially when the common currency cannot be easily measured in dollars. We use a population simulation model (e.g. spatially explicit individual-based model) to model a hypothetical forest bird population's response to different cutting and planting regimes. We then link these results to a dynamic programming model to determine the optimal choice a manager should make at each time step to minimize revenue foregone by not harvesting timber while maintaining a given population of birds. Our results show that if optimal management choices are made further back in time, future (terminal) reward may be greater. As the end of the management period approaches, past management practices influence the terminal reward more than future practices can. Thus if past revenue lost is high, the future reward will be low as compared to when past revenue lost is low. The general strategy of setting some minimum viable population size and then using a population simulator linked to a dynamic programming model to ask how to maintain such a population size with minimum economic loss should have nearly universal applicability in conservation biology.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Contrary to a widely-held perception, game theory can provide a consistent and rigorous economic justification for the safe minimum standard (SMS) constraint on economic development. S.V. Ciriacy-Wantrup (1968) based the SMS on the idea that risk-aversion is an important public policy motive, and Richard Bishop (1978) tried to theoretically justify this idea 20 years ago by applying the minimax decision rule to an insurance (loss avoidance) game-theoretic model. More recently Richard Ready and Bishop (1991) distinguished two different games against nature and determined that the minimax rule implied opposite choices (for preservation, for development) in the models and, therefore, game theory could not provide a consistent rationale for the SMS. Ready and Bishop's two games can be viewed as subgames of a more comprehensive dynamic game of society against nature. The minimax decision rule yields contrary results because the two subgames embody different kinds of uncertainty. Further, the minimax rule both ignores the social cost of wrong choices and violates Milnor's bonus invariance axiom for game-theoretic decision rules (Milnor, J., 1964). A minimax-regret decision rule is preferred because it emphasizes risk-aversion while explicitly incorporating the opportunity cost of making a 'wrong' choice between preservation and development. The rule gives rise to a consistent choice of preservation over both the insurance and lottery games and transfers the burden of argument from preservationists to developers. On the other hand, the SMS constraint on development is contingent on the size of development benefits foregone and thus is not absolute and binding.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The paper introduces the pest belief model and Fishbein and Ajzen's theory of reasoned action to analyze farmers' decisions in stem borer management. Farmers spent an average of $39/ha (median $18) on insecticides believing that if they had not controlled an average loss of 1004 kg/ha or $402 (median 592, $237) would occur. Farmers' estimates of the worst attack averaged 19 white heads/m2 (median 10) with the associated average loss of 1038 kg/ha or $415 (median 592, $270), implying that farmers' decisions were guided by the worst attacks. Perceived benefits from insecticides were directly related with farmers' insecticide use and perceived severity. Perceived susceptibility was also high, with 59% of farmers believing that a loss of 450 kg/ha would be 'extremely or very likely'. Farmers believed insecticides could destroy natural enemies but placed only moderate importance to conserving them. Health was believed to be very important but farmers had mixed beliefs that spraying could bring about poor health. This study also provides evidence suggesting high peer pressure on farmers' spray decisions directly influencing perceived benefits from sprays, insecticide spending and spray frequency.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives. The principal aim was to determine whether 'controlled' motivation can account for differences in persistence with weight-loss dieting. The study also investigated whether goal-setting attributes moderated or mediated the relationship between controlled motivation to diet and persistence with dieting. Design. A 2 x 2 between-subjects design was used, with controlled motivation (low versus high), and type of feedback (positive versus negative)as the independent variables. This design enabled the investigation of their separate and interactive effects. Method. In a vignette study, 100 females were told to imagine they wanted to lose 3 kilograms. They then answered questions concerning their individual weight-loss goals. Controlled motivation was assessed via a questionnaire. Two predetermined schedules of reinforcement for the dieting created a positive and a negative feedback group. The number of weeks for which the participants indicated they would continue dieting provided the index of dieting persistence, or the outcome measure. Results. The findings revealed that those with highly controlled dieting motivation persisted with dieting for longer than those whose motivation was less controlled, irrespective of whether weight was lost. Goal specificity moderated the effect of controlled motivation on persistence, and commitment to weight-loss goals partially mediated the contribution of controlled motivation to persistence. Conclusions. To understand variability in the persistence of weight-loss dieting, we need to invoke differences in the nature of motivation to diet and specific weight-loss goal attributes. Prevention strategies should aim to encourage autonomous decision making among young females, especially in relation to weight-loss dieting.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: During the last several years outsourcing has emerged as a major issue in information systems management. As competitive forces impinge on business firms, senior managers are re-structuring their organizations with an eye on attaining or maintaining competitive advantage. Various strategies to IS outsourcing have emerged, for example, some outsourcers contract with a sole vendor while others contract with several. To date no studies have been done to determine which strategies are appropriate under what conditions. And while some firms have achieved varying degrees of success with any of these strategies, many have encountered significant difficulties. How then are managers to choose from a set of options that which is most appropriate for their firm? Outsourcing problems are complex and entail considerable implications for the strategy of the firm. A wrong decision can result in loss of core competencies and capabilities, and exposure to unexpected risks. Although many articles have appeared on outsourcing, few have extended the discussion beyond simple cost-benefit analysis. In this paper we discuss a transaction cost theory approach to the analysis of outsourcing decision making. Our approach provides managers with a strategy and techniques for analyzing some of the more subtle issues they may face when dealing with complex outsourcing decisions problems.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A meta-analysis of Asian-disease-like studies is presented to identify the factors which determine risk preference. First the confoundings between probability levels, payoffs, and framing conditions are clarified in a task analysis. Then the role of framing, reflection, probability, type, and size of payoff is evaluated in a meta-analysis. It is shown that bidirectional framing effects exist for gains and for losses. Presenting outcomes as gains tends to induce risk aversion, while presenting outcomes as losses tends to induce risk seeking. Risk preference is also shown to depend on the size of the payoffs, on the probability levels, and on the type of good at stake (money/property vs human lives). In general, higher payoffs lead to increasing risk aversion. Higher probabilities lead to increasing risk aversion for gains and to increasing risk seeking for losses. These findings are confirmed by a subsequent empirical test. Shortcomings of existing formal theories, such as prospect theory, cumulative prospect theory, venture theory, and Markowitz's utility theory, are identified. It is shown that it is not probabilities or payoffs, but the framing condition, which explains most variance. These findings are interpreted as showing that no linear combination of formally relevant predictors is sufficient to capture the essence of the framing phenomenon. © 1999 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

In our model, all agents are perfectly selfish. When a public good is to be provided privately after the insurance decision, the player facing greater uncertainty can expect an income transfer from the other individuals through the commitments to the public good.

      "Abstract: The objective of the study was to assess varicella epidemiology and the cost of disease in Spain, in order to perform a cost-benefit analysis of universal vaccination at 15 months of age. Epidemiological data were obtained from a survey of 150 children with varicella, from hospitalizations and from the Spanish literature. A Markov decision tree was designed with two alternatives, vaccination or nonvaccination. Direct costs derived from the disease were lower than the cost of vaccination (ratio 0.54:1), however when indirect costs, such as working time loss were taken into account, vaccination was the best alternative, with a saving of P.2627 per vaccinated subject (P. 1.6 recovered per peseta invested in the program). Sensitivity analysis shows that decreasing vaccine coverage and efficacy to 0.7, increasing the annual discount rate to 20% and with a vaccine price less than P6000, vaccination is always the best alternative. In conclusion, from the economic point of view, a universal varicella vaccination program in children at 15 months of age would be justified in Spain.\u001b[0m :\n",

We study an insurance mechanism under which the plan of project implementation maximizing the expected value of profits becomes optimal almost surely. The mechanism is linear in the decision variables, \"actuarially fair\" and robust to changes in the utility function. The premium and the compensation in the insurance scheme are expressed through dual variables associated with information constraints in the problem of maximization of expected profits. These dual variables are interpreted as the shadow prices of information. Along with the general model, several specialized models are considered in which the insurance mechanism and the shadow prices are examined in detail. © Journal of Applied Mathematics & Decision Sciences.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When a prior outcome in a sequence of risky decisions has been encountered, it is either integrated or segregated in the evaluation of the expected outcomes of a current decision. Previous research supports an integration principle (the loss-sensitivity principle) stating that a prior outcome is only added to the expected losses. An experiment employing four groups of 16 undergraduates was conducted with the aim of investigating whether or not a prior outcome also influences the subjective probabilities of the expected outcomes. Although the results failed to show that ratings of subjective probability were affected by a prior outcome, the effect of the prior outcome on the likelihood of gambling was as expected stronger when the probabilities were inexact and therefore possibly more open to subjective influences. An alternative explanation was proposed which both assumes that the loss-sensitivity principle is valid and that prior outcomes affect decision weights. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "Abstract: We use a nested-logit model of recreational fishing to examine how varying the range of fishing activities included in the choice set affects welfare measures. The basic analytical results are quite intuitive: welfare calculations with a site-choice travel cost model that omits relevant substitute activities will tend to understate gains and to overstate losses for a fixed sample and a fixed set of model parameters. The magnitude of bias in any particular case will be directly related to the degree of substitution between the omitted activities and the activities included in the model. In our empirical application, we examine changes in the quality of trout and salmon fishing on the Great Lakes and on anadromous runs. For most of the scenarios examined, we find that models that only include Great Lakes and anadromous fishing activities, to the exclusion of inland fishing activities, yield welfare results that are relatively similar to those of models that include the full range of activities, provided care is taken to extrapolate the results to a common population. The results are due to the relatively low predicted rates of substitution between inland and Great Lakes fishing activities. We derive implications for benefits transfer procedures. © 2000 Marine Resources Foundation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Once only of significance to local communities, mangrove areas in the Philippines are now an internationally visible and highly valued resource, principally as a consequence of the emergence of the shrimp culture industry. This has resulted in a conflict with the traditional uses of the mangrove areas, as unmodified ecosystems, including firewood gathering, thatch material (Nypa species) for homes and mangrove poles for lumber and construction materials, and nursery grounds for the small scale and commercial marine fisheries. In effect, mangrove forested areas in the Philippines have been steadily transferred from a common property resource, of multiple use and benefit to a large number of people, to a private good, of single use for shrimp ponds, whose profits are narrowly channeled to the benefit of a select few. This paper examines the trade-offs of this change in mangrove area use. The trade-offs are examined through three interlinked analyses. The first is a population dynamics model which illustrates the effect of the changes in the habitat (mangrove hectares) to the population of a single mangrove-dependent fish species from the family Leiognathidae. The paper then applies an assumed stock loss scenario from the model to a multiple objective benefit analysis and evaluates the net benefits obtained under three alternatives for the mangrove area: (1) leaving the area undeveloped; (2) developing the area for polyculture; and (3) developing the area for semi-intensive shrimp aquaculture: The procedure in the multiple objective benefit analysis is to classify the benefits to each group affected by the decision and the consequences or net benefits to the groups in aggregate. The results are discussed vis-a-vis social equity issues.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Escalation of commitment is a well-known phenomenon whereby individuals and organizations continue to invest in what appear to be losing courses of action. Traditional theories of escalation implicitly assume the phenomenon is dysfunctional and results from flawed, or irrational, decision-making. Some have argued, however, that the phenomenon results from equivocal information concerning a particular course of action and does not necessarily represent a flawed or irrational decision process. To shed light on this distinction, we examine prior theories of escalation and introduce a reinterpretation of the phenomenon based on options theory. To provide a context for our discussion, we examine information systems (IS) project escalation. While escalation is a general phenomenon, IS investments represent a particularly appealing context of study for several reasons. First, investments in information technology represent a significant and growing fraction of total capital expenditures for most organizations. Second, IS projects exhibit certain characteristics which create ambiguity and may cause them to be especially susceptible to escalation. Our analysis suggests that traditional theories of escalation behavior give an incomplete picture because they do not provide a mechanism for distinguishing warranted from unwarranted escalation. Thus, traditional theories provide little explanation for those situations in which escalation behavior is economically prudent. Failure to consider the value of real options means that the perceived benefits of a project are lower than the actual benefits, meaning that managers are apt to reject or prematurely cancel projects that would in fact be economically beneficial to pursue. This paper applies options theory to show that some projects that might otherwise be viewed as cases of unwarranted escalation, actually involve situations in which escalation is warranted. The options theory perspective offers new theoretical insights that challenge the traditional assumptions and yet complement existing theories regarding escalation behavior. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Economic models of voting proved very successful at predicting party choice in Great Britain during the 1980s and early 1990s, providing strong support for a reward/punish hypothesis of electoral behaviour: government parties were rewarded by support from those who felt well off and were optimistic, but were punished with removal of support by those feeling worse off and economically pessimistic. This paper extends those analyses, using a pioneering longitudinal study of British adults over the period 1991-4, during which the government party (Conservative) became increasingly unpopular, despite an improving economic record. Analyses show that although the party was rewarded by continuing support from its voters who were prospering and lost support among those who were not, it failed to win support from those who initially favoured the opposition parties and yet were feeling well off. This suggests that the reward/punishment model was operating in an asymmetric way. Attempts to fit similar models to the strength, and changing strength, of party identification were largely unsuccessful, however.\u001b[0m :\n",

Selling price is estimated by means of a linear model applied to a sample of comparable properties. The estimated market price is then adjusted for asymmetry in the loss function, overestimation being more serious than underestimation in the present case, with optimal adjustment factors derived under LINEX loss and normal prediction errors. A vague prior distribution is assumed and its parameters are revised based upon sample estimates. The model is applied to an actual townhouse development. The methodology is general and applicable to a wide variety of problems of estimation, prediction, forecasting and control.\u001b[0m :\n",

Logistic regression analysis of data from dichotomous choice contingent valuation studies often models the willingness-to-pay curve poorly. We develop solutions to this problem. We also show how to model responses as a function of several covariates, and how to model the case in which a proportion of respondents is not willing to pay anything. Analytic and bootstrap methods for quantifying precision are developed. We illustrate the methods by using an example in which biodiversity losses due to acid rain deposition in Scotland are valued.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Definite mobility changes occur when older drivers reduce or cease driving. In a majority of cases, mobility declines. Fewer trips will be taken, shorter distances will be traveled, fewer or no trips will be taken under certain conditions, and the older person will be more often traveling according to the schedules and convenience of others. Older drivers make about six trips/week, in contrast to two trips/week for older non-drivers. The older person who reduces or ceases driving bears the brunt of the changes that occur in terms of monetary, social, psychological, and emotional costs. When it is not possible to maintain previous connections established by our elderly citizens, society suffers from the lack of access to the expertise of these older adults as well as from the loss of their productivity as workers and volunteers. Thus there are many reasons to take steps to reduce the potential mobility losses associated with the reduction or cessation of driving. The concept that life depends on driving is less prevalent when other travel options are available. Adults who had access to a well-developed public transportation system and who could live in close proximity to the kinds of shopping and recreational opportunities that appeal to seniors felt that a car was not a necessity to live an active life. They could control their mobility choices and could make reasoned choices about whether to drive.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent studies have shown that auditor changes are frequently initiated by the auditor rather than the client. In this study, we argue that auditors’ decisions to resign or decline engagements can be explained predominantly by audit error cost, the cost of undiscovered audit errors. This cost reflects both the auditor’s assessment of the likelihood of client misrepresentations and the expected losses if these misrepresentations are subsequently revealed. We provide empirical evidence to support our theory. We make a distinction in our study between resignations and declinations and treat these two types of events separately in both our modeling and empirical tests. Additionally, we examine the role of auditor expertise in an auditor’s decision to continue an engagement. We argue that expertise reduces expected audit error costs and consequently limits the likelihood that an auditor will resign or decline an engagement. Finally, some evidence is provided concerning the assertion made by Big Six auditing firms that they are staying away from litigation-prone sections of the economy. © 1999, SAGE Publications.

      "Abstract: This article presents a new test of a principle of decision making called dynamic consistency. This principle was tested in an experiment in which participants were asked to make decisions about a second gamble within a sequence of two gambles. Participants were first asked to make a planned choice about the second gamble. The planned choice was made before the first gamble was played and was conditioned on the anticipated outcomes of the first gamble. After the first gamble was played, the same participants were asked to make a final choice about the second gamble, conditioned on the ex-perienced outcome of the first gamble. The results showed that participants' final choices were frequently inconsistent with their plans, even when the anticipated and experienced outcomes were identical. These inconsistencies occurred in a systematic direction. Experiencing an anticipated gain resulted with a change toward risk aversion, and experiencing an anticipated loss resulted in a change toward risk seeking. These results are explained in terms of the effect of actual experience on the reference point used for the evaluation of the decision problem.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Optimization is a mathematical sophistication of the common sense view that decision makers ought to do the best they can, and leads to well known solution concepts for mathematical games. For multi-agent systems in naturalistic settings, however, uncertainty and complexity may subordinate optimal performance to the more moderate goals of functionality and robustness. Moderation is another common sense idea that can be made mathematically precise by defining a notion of comparative rationality, leading to a theory of satisficing games. Preferences in an m-agent satisficing game are characterized by a 2m-dimensional interdependence function, from which the joint m-dimensional gains and losses of the agent system can be derived and compared to determine the set of jointly satisficing decisions. This paradigm permits decision makers in the presence of uncertainty to consider multiple sets of possible actions and make decisions that are both robust and functional. Two well-known games, Prisoner's Dilemma and Battle of the Sexes, are analyzed from this, point of view. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Attribution theory suggests that women may be less likely to take risk than men when faced with similar decision-making problems. The present study sought to determine whether there would be differences between men and women with respect to their supplier choices based on how the purchasing decision was framed. Two experiments were conducted: one using a price-based purchasing scenario and the other using a price-based and a quality-based purchasing scenario. For the price-based scenario women tended to make more risky supplier choices than men when the purchasing decision was framed as a loss, and less risky supplier choices than men when the purchasing decision was framed as a gain. No differences between the sexes were found for the quality-based scenario. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

We pay particular attention to the return to experience and the human capital loss parameter when women are allowed to self-select into various possible combinations of interruption and fertility outcomes. We find that ignoring endogenous fertility decisions may seriously bias the effect of non-employment spell lengths on female earnings, as well as the return to experience. To a large extent, the negative relationship between female earnings and non-employment spell length, that is widely documented in the earlier literature, is the result of a misspecification of the earnings functions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To assess changes in eating and exercise self-efficacy and decisional balance for exercise in an obese population enrolled in a multi-disciplinary weight management program. Research Method and Procedures: Thirty-two obese women were assessed at entry and after 12 weeks of treatment. Results: Participants showed 15% mean weight loss after 12 weeks of treatment. Mean minutes of self-reported exercise increased by 229%. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in self-efficacy for both eating and exercise and health parameters but not in decisional balance for exercise adoption. Discussion: These results may have implications for the practitioner in that self-efficacy changes occur during successful weight loss, but decisional balance for exercise may not change until individuals enter maintenance. These results imply that practitioners may be advised to shift from confidence building to relapse prevention early on in treatment, and that focusing on strengthening the pros of exercise and reducing the cons of exercise may need to remain constant during treatment.

      "Abstract: To estimate the health and non-health effects of fluoridation on well-being using the willingness-to-pay technique. Methods: A pilot study of 100 people was undertaken in which the willingness-to-pay technique was used to estimate the welfare effects of community water fluoridation in the city of Sheffield, in the United Kingdom. In view of the pilot nature of the study, it was decided to use quota sampling based on age and sex rather than random sampling. Reasons for respondents' answers and their previous knowledge of fluoridation were also noted. Results: Sixty-two percent of respondents were in favour of fluoridation, 31% were opposed, and 7% were unsure. Thirty-one respondents refused to answer the willingness-to-pay questions. The mean willingness to pay for those in favour of fluoridation was less than that for those opposed to fluoridation. The main reasons given for opposing fluoridation were its impact on freedom of choice and the desire for pure water. Nineteen percent of the sample held incorrect information on the effects of fluoridation. Conclusions: The study illustrates how a simple referendum can miss important information regarding the intensity of individuals' preferences. An important aspect of the willingness-topay technique is its ability to identify 'losers' and quantify their welfare loss. This issue has been ignored by all previous economic evaluations of fluoridation. Further investigation is required to replicate this work on a larger sample of individuals, and to develop the willingness-to-pay technique.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of this study was to empirically estimate the expected utility gained from the implementation of the 1997 helmet law in Taiwan by using quality-adjusted survival time (QAST). We randomly selected 400 out of 8221 registered cases of head injury and successfully interviewed 99 cases with the index of health-related quality of life (IHRQ). The function of IHRQ was then multiplied with the corresponding survival function to obtain the QAST for head injury. The total utility gained from the helmet law in Taipei within 1 year was estimated by multiplying the expected loss of utility per patient with the number of prevented cases. The results showed that after 80 months of follow-up, the QAST of the injured population was 66.3 quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs), while that of the reference population was 78.7 QALMs. We extrapolated the QAST for total life expectancy by simulating the survival of head injury cases using the life table data from the general population. The life-long utility loss of a head injury case was found to be 4.8 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). The number of prevented cases during the first year of enforcement of the helmet law was estimated to be 1300 cases in Taipei, which amounted to 6240 QALYs gained. For lack of data, we were unable to calculate the possible gain from helmet on reduction of severity among nonfatal cases with head injury, and the estimation was only a lower bound. We concluded that the QAST approach is a feasible approach applicable to health policy decision-making, especially in cost-utility analysis. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this article, the authors explore whether choice patterns are sensitive to the potential of relevant trade-offs to elicit negative emotion. Across three experiments, decision makers increasingly use a choice strategy that maximizes quality at the expense of some currency (usually price) when the quality attribute is rated as more inherently emotion-laden (Experiment 1) or involves losses rather than gains (Experiments 2 and 3). These emotional trade-off difficulty effects on choice are obtained even after controlling for effects that are attributable to subjects' relative importance weights for the quality versus currency attributes. A fourth experiment validates that tasks requiring losses (versus gains) on quality attributes are assessed as particularly emotion-laden by naïve subjects. Overall, it appears that coping with potentially emotion-laden choice trade-offs is one factor influencing consumer choice strategies. Thus, emotional trade-off difficulty is a factor that marketers should consider when attempting to predict and explain consumer choice patterns. These conclusions are consistent with recent research that argues that avoiding or otherwise coping with negative emotion is an important goal that guides decision behavior (e.g., Larrick 1993; Luce, Bettman, and Payne 1997; Simonson 1992).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Between 1994 and 1996 we studied injury patterns in more than 22,000 first-time snowboarders and first-time skiers to determine the comparative injury risk of these two popular sports coexisting in winter resort areas. The first-time participants included in this study had no previous experience in their activity of choice and enrolled in Learn to Snowboard and Learn to Ski programs in two major northeastern ski resorts. Data were gathered from physician evaluations at the medical clinics at each mountain. Two hundred seventy-three (4%) of the first.-time snowboarders (N = 6585), and 641 (4%) of the first-time skiers (N = 15,795) sustained an injury. Injuries were further evaluated by location (upper extremity, lower extremity, head, and trunk area) and severity (emergent versus nonemergent). Snowboarders had a higher percentage of upper extremity injuries (53%), while skiers had a higher percentage of lower extremity injuries (63%). Snowboarders, however, sustained a significantly higher incidence of emergent injuries (such as fracture, concussion, dislocation, lost teeth) necessitating immediate intervention. While there have been other reports describing injuries in these activities, no previous study attempted to look at the first-time participants with similar age, experience, and equipment to determine comparative risk. We conclude that for the first-time participant, snowboarding does show a higher incidence of emergent injuries.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aim. To explore framing or editing effects and a method to debias framing in a clinical context. Method. Clinical scenarios using multioutcome life-expectancy lotteries of equal value required choices between two supplementary drugs that either prolonged or shortened life from the 20-year beneficial effect of a baseline drug. The effects of these supplementary drugs were presented in two conditions, using a between-subjects design. In segregated editing (n = 116) the effects were presented separately from the effects of the baseline drug. In integrated editing (n = 100), effects of supplementary and baseline drugs were combined in the lottery presentation. Each subject responded to 30 problems. To explore one method of debiasing, another 100 subjects made choices after viewing both segregated and integrated editings of 20 problems (dual framing). Results. Statistically significant preference reversals between segregated and integrated editing of pure lotteries occurred only when one framing placed outcomes in the gain domain, and the other framing placed them in the loss domain. When both editings resulted in gain-domain outcomes only, there was no framing effect. There was a related relationship of framing-effect shifts from losses to gains in mixed-lottery-choice problems. Responses to the dual framing condition did not consistently coincide with responses to either single framing. In some situations, dual framing eliminated or lessened framing effects. Conclusion. The results support two components of prospect theory, coding outcomes as gains or losses from a reference point, and an s-shaped utility function (concave in gain, convex in loss domains). Presenting both alternative editings of a complex situation prior to choice more fully informs the decision maker and may help to reduce framing effects. Given the extent to which preferences shift in response to alternative presentations, it is unclear which choice represents the subject's 'true preferences'.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous survey research with both clinical populations and random samples of the general population has established that individuals may experience harmful impacts arising from both their gambling and their consumption of alcohol. Experimental study of the interaction of alcohol consumption on gambling is notable for its absence from the literature. Aim. To experimentally study the interaction of alcohol consumption and gambling behaviour. Design. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups - placebo administered and alcohol administered, thus making an independent samples experimental design. Setting. Laboratory. Participants. Forty young, male, regular EGM players, who also regularly consumed alcohol. Measurements. The NEO Personality Inventory; The Scale of Gambling Choices (Revised) (SGC); persistence at gambling while losing, as measured by the number of gambling trials played and amount wagered. Findings. Subjects either received a prior intake of three intake of three alcoholic drinks each containing approximately 10 g of pure alcohol (beer or wine) or an equal volume of an equivalent non-alcoholic beverage. The alcohol group persisted for twice as many gaming trials as the placebo group with significantly more players who had consumed alcohol losing all their original cash stake (50% compared with 15% of the placebo group). Conclusions. The consumption of alcohol appeared to eliminate the strong associations found in placebo group between individual difference measures and persistence. The analogue game was accepted by participants as a valid form of gambling. The results showed that relatively small quantities of alcohol have a significant effect on the psychological processes that underpin self-control over gambling. This finding challenges the conceptual research paradigm of studying co-morbidity or dual-addicted clinical populations as the most appropriate method of understanding how two addictive behaviours interact.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this paper the results of an application of an alternative technique, choice modeling, are reported. Choice modeling has been developed in the marketing and transport applications but has only been used in a handful of environmental applications, most of which have focused on use values. The case study presented here involves the estimation of the nonuse environmental values provided by the Macquarie Marshes, a major wetland in New South Wales, Australia. Estimates of the nonuse value the community places on preventing job losses are also presented. The reported models are robust, having high explanatory power and variables that are statistically significant and consistent with expectations.

      "Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of regulations that prohibit using a cellular telephone while driving a motor vehicle. Design: Decision analysis of risks and benefits related to cellular telephones and driving. Setting: United States population in 1997. Measures; Health benefits measured as the quality-adjusted life years potentially saved. Financial benefits measured as health care and other services potentially averted. Costs of regulation measured as the lost productivity derived from willingness to pay for cellular telephone calls. Results: Under base-case conditions, cellular telephone calls in the United States each day accounted for about 984 reported collisions, 1,729 total collisions, 2 deaths, 317 persons with injuries, 99 lost years of life expectancy, 161 lost quality-adjusted life years, $1 million in health care costs, and $4 million in property damage and other costs. This reflected a total of about 35 million telephone calls while driving, 70 million calling minutes, and $33 million in total value to society. The estimated cost-effectiveness ratio for a regulation restricting cellular telephone usage while driving was $300,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved, but ranged from $50,000 to $700,000 under alternative assumptions and interpretations of data. Regulations applied to teenage males could be cost-saving to society if the value of a call fell below 37 per minute. Conclusions: Regulations restricting cellular telephone usage while driving are less cost-effective for society than other safety measures. Nevertheless, regulations may be justifiable because the benefits and harms do not always involve the individual who has the cellular telephone. Increasing the price of a call (or adding a supplementary tax) might decrease the number of discretionary calls, be cost-saving for society, and be life-saving for individuals.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Based on our previous work on the standard measure of risk, this paper presents two classes of measures for perceived risk by decomposing a lottery into its mean and standard risk. One of the classes of our risk measures presumes that there is no risk when there is no uncertainty involved, and the other allows different degenerate lotteries to be evaluated with different values of 'risk'. The former has more prescriptive appeal in risky decision making, but the latter may have more descriptive power for subjective risk judgments. Our risk measures can also take into account the asymmetric effects of losses and gains on perceived risk based on an appropriate choice of the standard measure of risk. The perceived risk models we propose unify a large body of empirical evidence regarding risk judgments, and provide sufficient flexibility to better capture people's perceptions of risk than previously developed risk models. In particular, our risk measures provide clear ways to accommodate financial measures of risk and psychological measures of risk, and they can be incorporated into preference models in an appealing form based on mean-risk tradeoffs.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The Double-Bounded Dichotomous-Choice (DB-DC) Contingent Valuation format is thought to yield more precise welfare estimates. Questions remain about its validity. The initial bid may represent information with which respondents update their willingness to pay. A Bayesian model of respondent decision making is estimated for two data sets. The results indicate updating or shifts in respondent willingness to pay between iterated valuations. Nonparametric testing of the welfare estimates reveals that the model incorporating updating yields different values from the standard model. The expected increases in the precision of the DB-DC welfare estimates are lost when updating occurs.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When faced with medical decisions involving uncertain outcomes, the principles of decision theory hold that we should select the option with the highest expected utility to maximize health over time. Whether a decision proves right or wrong can be learned only in retrospect, when it may become apparent that another course of action would have been preferable. This realization may bring a sense of loss, or regret. When anticipated regret is compelling, a decision maker may choose to violate expected utility theory to avoid regret. We formulate a concept of acceptable regret in medical decision making that explicitly introduces the patient's attitude toward loss of health due to a mistaken decision into decision making, in most cases, minimizing expected regret results in the same decision as maximizing expected utility. However, when acceptable regret is taken into consideration, the threshold probability below which we can comfortably withhold treatment is a function only of the net benefit of the treatment, and the threshold probability above which we can comfortably administer the treatment depends only on the magnitude of the risks associated with the therapy. By considering acceptable regret, we develop new conceptual relations that can help decide whether treatment should be withheld or administered, especially when the diagnosis is uncertain. This may be particularly beneficial in deciding what constitutes futile medical care.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives - To determine the effects of the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) on skeletal health, soft tissue injury, and performance in female athletes. Methods - A literature review was performed using literature retrieval methods to locate relevant studies. Results - Most female athletes primarily choose to use the OCP for contraceptive purposes, but cycle manipulation and control of premenstrual symptoms are secondary advantages of its use. The effect of the OCP on bone density in normally menstruating women is unclear, with some studies reporting no effect, others a positive effect, and some even a negative effect. The OCP is often prescribed for the treatment of menstrual disturbances in female athletes, and improvements in bone density may result. Whether the OCP influences the risk of stress fracture and soft tissue injuries is not clear from research to date. Effects of the OCP on performance are particularly relevant for elite sportswomen. Although a reduction in Vo2MAX has been reported in some studies, this may not necessarily translate to impaired performance in the field. Moreover, some studies claim that the OCP may well enhance performance by reducing premenstrual symptoms and menstrual blood loss. A fear of weight gain with the use of the OCP is not well founded, as population studies report no effect on weight, particularly with the lower dose pills currently available. Conclusions - Overall, the advantages of the pill for sportswomen would appear to outweigh any potential disadvantages. Nevertheless, there is individual variation in response to the OCP and these should be taken into account and monitored in the clinical situation. Nomen should be counselled as to the range of potential benefits and disadvantages in order to make an informed decision based on individual circumstances.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We study how decision makers choose when faced with multiple plays of a gamble or investment. When evaluating multiple plays of a simple mixed gamble, a chance to win x or lose y, subjects show a sensitivity to the amount to lose on a single trial, holding the distribution of returns for the portfolio constant; that is, they display `myopic loss aversion.' Many subjects who decline multiple plays of such a gamble will accept it when shown the resulting distribution. This analysis is applied to the problem of retirement investing. We show that workers invest more of their retirement savings in stocks if they are shown long-term (rather than one-year) rates of return.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous neuropsychological studies have demonstrated an association between false recognition and frontal lobe dysfunction. In the experiments reported here we explore the contribution of memory impairment and executive dysfunction to the pathogenesis of false facial recognition in patients with focal frontal lobe damage. Memory illusions in response to novel faces were observed in both anterograde and retrograde tests of face recognition memory. However, in neither memory domain could false recognition be accounted for by face memory loss. Instead, our findings suggest that false facial recognition in frontal patients reflects the breakdown of strategic memory retrieval, monitoring, and decision functions critical for attributing the experience of familiarity to a specific source. Frontal executive memory functions are primarily recruited under conditions of uncertainty when the face cue does not automatically elicit relevant contextual information, leaving the source of familiarity unspecified. Our results indicate that frontal patients do not spontaneously engage in effortful recollection of specific contexts that can normally be used to oppose and inhibit recognition decisions based on general or context-free familiarity. However, frontal patients can use context recollection to suppress false recognition once this strategy is pointed out to them. In some frontal patients false recognition may be material-specific. © 1999 Psychology Press Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The reality and perception of auditor independence is fundamental to public confidence in financial reporting. A new Independence Standards Board was set up in the U.S. in 1997 and the European Union (EU) is currently seeking to establish a common core of independence principles. The general setting within which audit decisions are made and independence perceptions are formed is evolving rapidly due to competitive and regulatory changes. Policy-makers must work continuously to evaluate the critical threat factors and develop appropriate independence principles. This paper explores the potential of recent regulatory reforms in the United Kingdom (U.K.), many of which are unique to that country, to strengthen the independence framework. Using a questionnaire instrument, U.K. interested parties' perceptions of the influence on auditor independence of a large set of 45 economic and regulatory factors are elicited. Most factors have a significant impact on independence perceptions for all groups (finance directors, audit partners, and financial journalists). The principal threat factors relate to economic dependence and non-audit service provision, while the principal enhancement factors relate to regulatory changes introduced in the early 1990s (the existence of an audit committee, the risk of referral to the Financial Reporting Review Panel and the risk to the audit firm of loss of Registered Auditor status). Exploratory factor analysis reduces the factor set to a smaller number of uncorrelated underlying dimensions. © 1999 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Information was sought from corporate and IS management about the firm's outsourcing practices and the factors affecting their outsourcing decision. Perhaps, the most surprising result of the study was the high level of consensus between the viewpoints of the two management groups. Differences were noted between the respondents who rejected outsourcing, those who outsource on a temporary basis and those who outsource on a permanent basis. The economic variables were very important to those who outsource on a permanent basis and those who rejected outsourcing. This supports the controversy surrounding the source of the savings associated with outsourcing. The negative aspects of outsourcing, such as loss of control, data security and loss of in-house expertise were rated more important by the firms which rejected outsourcing than the firms which outsourced.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study assessed weight concerns, body size perceptions, weight reduction attempts, and weight loss methods in fourth grade American Indian children. Research Methods' and Procedures: Participants (n = 304) attended one of eight schools in the Pathways Feasibility Study. Question and answer choices were read to children by trained staff, and children marked their own answers. Results: Thirty-eight percent of the children reported that they had tried to lose weight. The most common strategy for weight reduction was exercising more. Girls were more likely than boys to be dissatisfied with their body size (48% of girls vs. 34% of boys desired a slimmer body size; 22% of girls vs. 15% of boys desired a larger body size; p<0.001). Children who had tried to lose weight were more likely to indicate that the size they most desired and the most healthy size were smaller than their perceived size (p<0.001). Children who reported trying to lose weight were also more likely to want to be skinnier and to be unhappy about their weight than were children who did not report trying to lose weight (p<0.001 for both). Discussion: We conclude that weight loss attempts and weight-related concerns are prevalent in American Indian children at a young age. Copyright © 1999 NAASO.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A key decision faced by managers of generic advertising programs is the allocation of the budget among media (e.g., television, radio, print). In this article, the economics of media allocation are addressed using catfish as a case study. The hypothesis that demand responds equally to all media was rejected. Further analysis indicated that the media with relatively modest expenditures (newspapers and television) had no reliable effect on demand, which suggests that scale is important. Losses sustained from the apparently ineffectual media were more than offset by gains from the effective media (magazines and radio), so that returns overall, net of opportunity cost, were positive. The historical media allocation, however, was inefficient in the sense that a different media mix would have resulted in greater industry profits. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: To control risk-related incentive problems, equity holders are expected to manage both the convexity and slope of the relation between firm performance and managers' wealth. I find stock options, but not common stockholdings, significantly increase the sensitivity of CEOs' wealth to equity risk. Cross-sectionally, this sensitivity is positively related to firms' investment opportunities. This result is consistent with managers receiving incentives to invest in risky projects when the potential loss from underinvestment in valuable risk-increasing projects is greatest. Firms' stock-return volatility is positively related to the convexity provided to managers, suggesting convex incentive schemes influence investing and financing decisions. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Mate choice is a process of negotiation in which individuals make decisions about whether or not to allow a relationship with a prospective mate to develop into a long-term relationship. In some cases, this process begins with opening bids between strangers. Although each individual may have a clearly perceived set of preferred options, frequency-dependent effects and constraints on available search time often mean that individuals have to settle for less than ideal partners. Age is a criterion that males use in judging the mate value of prospective female partners, because it correlates with fertility. In this paper, we analyze personal advertisements to show that women may decline to declare their age in order to appear younger than they really are. This allows them to be more demanding than they would otherwise be able to be. A comparison of trait profiles with those of women of known age suggests that individuals who disguise their ages are likely to be in the age range 35 to 50 years. Three alternative explanations for this can be suggested: such behavior might be an attempt to find a high-quality partner (1) before their reproductive opportunities are foreclosed by menopause, (2) to replace lost paternal investment, or (3) to reduce the burden on the children of caring for aging parents by obtaining companionship and assistance from a new partner. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Ambiguity aversion is one of the most robust phenomena documented in the decision making literature, though there are still disagreements concerning what constitutes an adequate account for its occurrence. We describe six experiments that shed additional light on the enigmatic phenomenon of ambiguity avoidance. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that ambiguity avoidance holds for both gains and losses and for different modes of framing. It holds even when the ambiguous condition is normatively superior. Experiments 3-6 vary the amount of information associated with ambiguity. We conclude that perceived informativeness (regardless of its normative relevance) is a major component in distinguishing between risk and ambiguity, as well as determining the level of ambiguity. In the final discussion we link ambiguity avoidance to the 'certainty effect' (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), and suggest that both should be treated in the same framework. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The dimensions of adjustment examined are house value and rental costs, the number of 'excess' rooms, and housing tenure. Relatively few individuals move house in later life in Britain. Choices do respond to one's own retirement, but other household changes such as loss of spouse and spouse leaving employment are also important.

Risk-perception processes are those involved in estimating real-time parameters such as the speeds and distances of hazardous objects. Risk-acceptance processes relate to response choices given risk estimates. Risk-taking under fatigue was studied using a simulated intersection-crossing driving task in which subjects decided when it was safe to cross an intersection as an oncoming car approached from the cross street. The subjects performed this task at 3-hour intervals over a 36-hour period without sleep. Results were modeled using a model of real-time risky decision making that has perceptual components that process speed, time and distance information, and a decisional component for accepting risk. Results showed that varying a parameter for the decisional component across sessions best accounted for variations in performance relating to time of day.\u001b[0m :\n",

To meet the needs of price-conscious buyers, growers may attempt to reduce their production costs by reducing the level of production inputs, with some sacrifice in product quality. The owners of Two Sisters Greenhouses must decide whether they are going to produce lower-quality plants, change marketing strategies, or grow alterna-tive crops to retain their current profit margins.

Consistent with predictions, Study 1 shows that in the preparation phase, negotiators with a prosocial value orientation choose more cooperative heuristics (e.g., \"equal split is fair\") than competitive heuristics (e.g., \"your gain is my loss\") while negotiators with a competitive social value orientation do the reverse. Negotiators with an individualistic social value orientation do not discriminate in their choice between cooperative and competitive heuristics. Study 2 shows that following preparation, prosocial negotiators recall more cooperative than competitive heuristics while individualists and competitors do the reverse. Additional measures suggest that prosocial negotiators prefer cooperative heuristics because these are seen as morally appropriate, whereas individualists and competitors prefer competitive heuristics because these are seen as effective. © 1998 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background. Established practice is for the relatives of critically ill patients to be excluded from the clinical area during resuscitation. We aimed to discover whether relatives wanted to be present during the resuscitation of a family member and whether witnessing resuscitation had any adverse psychological effects on bereaved relatives. Methods. In this pilot study, relatives of patients who required resuscitation were given the option to remain with the patient during resuscitation or were not given this choice and directed to the relatives' room (control group). The unit of randomisation was the patient who required resuscitation and not the relatives. One close relative was paired with each patient. All relatives were accompanied by a chaperone who gave emotional support and provided technical information on the resuscitation. Relatives were followed up 1 month after the resuscitation. We used a questionnaire to ask about the decision to be present or absent during resuscitation. Bereaved relatives also completed five standardised psychological questionnaires to assess anxiety, depression, grief, intrusive imagery, and avoidance behaviour. Findings. 25 patients underwent resuscitation (13 in witnessed resuscitation group, 12 in control group). Three patients in the witnessed group survived, all the control group patients died. Two relatives in each group were lost to follow-up. Thus, eight relatives who witnessed resuscitation and ten control-group relatives were followed up. There were no reported adverse psychological effects among the relatives who witnessed resuscitation, all of whom were satisfied with their decision to remain with the patient. The clinical team became convinced of the benefits to relatives of allowing them to witness resuscitation if they wished, so the trial was terminated. Interpretation. In the context of the emergency department, routine exclusion of relatives from the resuscitation room may no longer be appropriate.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Context: The planning status of a pregnancy may affect a woman's prenatal behaviors and the health of her newborn. However, whether this effect is independent or is attributable to socioeconomic and demographic factors has not been explored using nationally representative data. Methods: Data were obtained on 9,122 births reported in the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health Survey and 2,548 births reported in the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. Multiple logistic regression analyses were employed to examine the effects of planning status on the odds of a negative birth outcome (premature delivery, low-birth-weight infant or infant who is small for gestational age), early well-baby care and breastfeeding. Results: The proportion of infants born with a health disadvantage is significantly lower if the pregnancy was intended than if it was mistimed or not wanted; the proportions who receive well-baby care by age three months and who are ever breastfed are highest if the pregnancy was intended. In analyses controlling for the mother's background characteristics, however, a mistimed pregnancy has no significant effect on any of these outcomes. An unwanted pregnancy increases the likelihood that the infant's health will be compromised (odds ratio, 1.3), but the association is no longer significant when the mother's prenatal behaviors are also taken into account. Unwanted pregnancy has no independent effect on the likelihood of well-baby care, but it reduces the odds of breastfeeding (0.6). Conclusions: Knowing the planning status of a pregnancy can help identify women who may need support to engage in prenatal behaviors that are associated with healthy outcomes and appropriate infant care.; The planning status of a pregnancy has been shown to influence maternal behaviors during pregnancy (e.g., smoking and weight gain) as well as pregnancy outcomes such as prematurity and low birth weight. It is possible, however, that the apparent effects of planning status actually reflect demographic and socioeconomic differences between women who plan their pregnancies and those who did not intend to conceive. This issue was explored through use of data on 9122 births reported in the 1988 US National Maternal and Infant Health Survey and 2548 births reported in the 1988 National Survey of Family Growth. In the first survey, 16% of intended births, compared with 20% of mistimed and 26% of unwanted births, had at least one negative outcome. Similarly, the proportions of infants who received well-baby care by 3 months and were breast-fed were highest when the pregnancy was intended. However, when the mother's physical and socioeconomic characteristics and the infant's health status at birth were controlled, a mistimed pregnancy had no significant effect on any of these outcomes. An unwanted birth was significantly more likely than an intended one to be associated with negative infant health outcomes when a woman's prior pregnancy experiences, physical characteristics, and socioeconomic status were controlled (odds ratio, 1.3), but the association lost significance when the mother's prenatal behaviors were considered. Unwanted pregnancy had no independent effect on the likelihood of well-baby care, but significantly reduced the likelihood of breast feeding (odds ratio, 0.6). These associations should be reassessed with more sophisticated measures and study design.

Thus players have preferences for complexity that depend on their own skill and the skill of their opponents. Such preferences are likely to be important determinants of players' choices. To illustrate, this paper analyzes a model where differently skilled players sort themselves across two-person win-draw-loss games of differing complexity, are randomly paired against opponents who have made similar choices and then play the games they have chosen.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: After only five years in operation, the Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPoS) system of Saudi Arabia has made a significant impact on the Kingdom's commercial environment. Recent EFTPoS statistics indicate growing consumer acceptance of the system. To help decision makers identify areas for further improvements in usage, the study reported in this article examines how EFTPoS usage and overall attitudes toward the system vary across different consumer demographic groups. Results of the study indicate that in general, consumers have favourable attitudes toward using the EFTPoS system. However, they are concerned about the possibilities of losing control over expenditures when purchases can be charged to electronic cards. Significant differences in EFTPoS usage and attitudes are found between men and women, consumers of different national backgrounds, and monthly income categories. Age and educational level do not have significant effects on attitudes. Practical and theoretical implications of the findings are outlined and discussed. © 1998, MCB UP Limited\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Heinrich's (1931) classical study implies that most industrial accidents can be characterized as a probabilistic result of human error. The present research quantifies Heinrich's observation and compares four descriptive models of decision making in the abstracted setting. The suggested quantification utilizes signal detection theory (Green & Swets, 1966). It shows that Heinrich's observation can be described as a probabilistic signal detection task. In a controlled experiment, 90 decision makers participated in 600 trials of six safety games. Each safety game was a numerical example of the probabilistic SDT abstraction of Heinrich's proposition. Three games were designed under a frame of gain to represent perception of safe choice as costless, while the other three were designed under a frame of loss to represent perception of safe choice as costly. Probabilistic penalty for Miss was given at three different levels (1, .5, .1). The results showed that decisions tended initially to be risky and that experience led to safer behavior. As the probability of being penalized was lowered decisions became riskier and the learning process was impaired. The results support the cutoff reinforcement learning model suggested by Erevet al.(1995). The hill-climbing learning model (Busemeyer & Myung, 1992) was partially supported. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 1998 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are differently described and the resulting preferences are studied. A meta-analysis of framing effects is presented for risky choice problems which are framed either as gains or as losses. This evaluates the finding that highlighting the positive aspects of formally identical problems does lead to risk aversion and that highlighting their equivalent negative aspects does lead to risk seeking. Based on a data pool of 136 empirical papers that reported framing experiments with nearly 30,000 participants, we calculated 230 effect sizes. Results show that the overall framing effect between conditions is of small to moderate size and that profound differences exist between research designs. Potentially relevant characteristics were coded for each study. The most important characteristics were whether framing is manipulated by changing reference points or by manipulating outcome salience, and response mode (choice vs. rating/judgment). Further important characteristics were whether options differ qualitatively or quantitatively in risk, whether there is one or multiple risky events, whether framing is manipulated by gain/loss or by task-responsive wording, whether dependent variables are measured between- or within- subjects, and problem domains. Sample (students vs. target populations) and unit of analysis (individual vs. group) was not influential. It is concluded that framing is a reliable phenomenon, but that outcome salience manipulations, which constitute a considerable amount of work, have to be distinguished from reference point manipulations and that procedural features of experimental settings have a considerable effect on effect sizes in framing experiments. © 1998 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous literature has supported the hypothesis that high rates of alcohol consumption are associated with adverse social consequences and that dependence on alcohol has an effect on that relationship. The purpose of this paper is to further specify the alcohol consumption-adverse consequences linkage by developing and estimating a latent variable model that incorporates the mediating effects of loss of control over alcohol consumption. This model is applied to measures for three alcohol-related constructs - consumption, loss of control and adverse consequences - incorporated in the 1991 National Household Survey on Drug abuse, for members of the primary workforce in the US. The research suggests that workplace decision makers attempting to minimize the adverse workplace consequences of alcohol abuse should implement procedures that assess and respond to alcohol dependency rather than relying exclusively on detection of and intervention with alcohol consumption per se.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article examines linkages between recent domestic out-migration from immigrant gateway metropolitan areas and nonmetropolitan migration gains, based on data of the 1990 census, 1996 Current Population Survey, and population estimates for the 1990–1996 period from the Bureau of Census. Our analysis of these data suggests that there is a mirror image of migration patterns between high immigration metropolitan area losses and nonmetropolitan area gains. This is especially evident in the West with the relationship between Los Angeles and San Francisco areas' losses on the one hand, and the region's nonmetropolitan gains on the other. While pre-elderly and elderly retirees have contributed to these nonmetropolitan gains, much of it is attributable to the destination choices of suburban-like populations—Whites with children, not college educated, and with lower incomes—that have been leaving high immigration metropolitan areas. This new, more dispersed form of “White flight” holds the potential for reinvigorating smaller, nonmetropolitan communities, but creating, as well, new demographic divisions across space. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

      "Abstract: This author's research is the first to address the dual loss of a child and of the role of parent. Earlier published findings (Talbot, 1996-97 & 1997-98) have emphasized the search for meaningful ways to continue \"mothering\" as part of a new, more integrated identity which acknowledges the child's death but also preserves the child's memory and honors the woman's past life as a mother. A positive life attitude (as measured by the Life Attitude Profile-Revised, Reker, 1992) was found to be an important indicator of adaptation to this unique form of bereavement. This third article discusses the impact of loss on human development and reports on factors associated with changes in personal identity experienced by the participants. Four factors were found to be common among those participants who felt they had survived their loss and changed in positive ways: 1) resolving a spiritual crisis brought about by the child's death; 2) making a conscious decision to survive; 3) reaching out to help others by volunteering or working in a helping profession; and 4) integrating what was learned from surviving the child's death into a new, more compassionate identity. © 1999, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Roughly one-quarter of all convicted federal defendants are sentenced for some kind of economic crime. Under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the primary determinant of sentence length for these defendants is the amount of loss\" resulting from their criminal conduct. However, the Guidelines' current rules defining \"loss\" are neither doctrinally coherent nor practically useful. In consequence, the \"loss\" calculation has generated hundreds of reported decisions, splits of opinion between the circuits on at least eleven analytically distinct issues on the meaning and application of the term \"loss,\" and growing frustration within the federal bench and bar with the entire scheme of economic crime sentencing. Professor Bowman examines the current theft and fraud guidelines in light of the basic purposes of sentencing, discusses the extensive federal case law on economic crime sentencing, identifies the deficiencies in the current theft and fraud guidelines, and proposes and analyzes a consolidated guideline for all federal theft and fraud offenses. Professor Bowman concludes that the Guidelines should continue to base economic crime sentences in significant part on the magnitude of the pecuniary harms defendants caused or intended, but that the centerpiece of an effective reform must be a redefinition of \"loss.\" The Article proposes: (1) consolidating the theft and fraud guidelines; (2) adopting \"specific offense characteristic\" adjustments for factors \"loss\" does not measure well (such as mental state and non-economic harms); (3) defining actual \"loss\" in terms of harms caused by defendant's criminal conduct and reasonably foreseeable to him; (4) adopting rules addressing the identity of \"victims\" of economic crime, the time at which \"loss\" should be measured, and the credits against \"loss\" a defendant should receive for value transferred to victims; (5) retaining, with some modifications, the present rule on \"intended loss.\".\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the classical decision theory framework, the loss is a function of the decision taken and the state of nature as represented by a parameter θ. Information about θ can be obtained via observation of a random variable X. In some situations however the loss will depend not directly on 8 but on the observed value of another random variable Y whose distribution depends on θ. This adds an extra layer to the decision problem, and may lead to a wider choice of actions. In particular there are now two sample sizes to choose, for X and for Y, leading to a range of behaviours in the Bayes risk. We illustrate this with a problem arising from the cleanup of sites contaminated with radioactive waste. We also discuss some computational approaches. © Journal of Applied Mathematics & Decision Sciences.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The \"lob-pass problem\" is a model which is used in the psychology. It describes the phenomena that the same choices decrease the effect, like the experience or the weariness. Abe and Takeuchi formulated it as an on-line learning problem, and pointed out that it is an extension of the multi-armed bandit problem. In the lob-pass problem, the player's choices will change the environment itself. This is the difference from the multi-armed bandit problems. The all proposed strategies for the lob-pass problem repeat the following procedures: (i) observe the reaction from the unknown environment (ii) estimate the environment (iii) find the optimal \"stationary\" strategy for the estimated environment (iv) determine the choice according to the strategy. Moreover, the criteria for the strategies in these studies are the loss due to uncertainness of the environment, compared with the optimal \"stationary\" strategy for the known-environment case. To judge whether such policies are appropriate or not, we have to know the optimal strategy, which may not be \"stationary\", for the known-environment case. It is calculated in the present paper. It is also shown that the \"matching condition\" assumed in the past studies is the necessary and sufficient condition that the optimal strategy doesn't depend on the stopping time of the game. The meaning and the appropriateness of the matching condition are discussed. Finally, the asymptotically optimality is defined. We prove that the stationary strategy can be asymptotically optimal for the opponent with the forgetting factor, but no strategy is asymptotically optimal for the opponent without the forgetting factor.\u001b[0m :\n",

Recently, Eeckhoudt, Gollier, and Schlesinger [1996] determine conditions on preferences such that first- and second-degree stochastic deteriorations in background risk lead to a decrease in the decision-maker's willingness to accept other risks. These results, although formulated in a general decision model, also apply to insurance demand.

We argue that this want/should distinction helps to explain the \"multiple-selves\" phenomenon and a recently discovered group of preference reversals noted in behavioral decision and organizational behavior research. We develop a history of knowledge on intrapersonal conflict, discuss how conflicts between what one wants to do and what one should do result in inconsistent behavior, connect this pattern of inconsistency to recent literature on joint versus separate preference reversals, and outline prescriptions for the management of intrapersonal conflict.\u001b[0m :\n",

Why did these painful measures elicit popular support in some nations, while triggering rejection and protest elsewhere? To complement extant explanations for these puzzling developments, the article draws on the core finding of prospect theory, a psychological theory of decision making under risk: people tend toward bold, risky choices when facing prospects of losses, but opt for caution when anticipating gains. Accordingly, leaders enact and citizens support drastic reforms only when they face deep crises, such as hyperinflation. This argument yields predictions about the different stages of the reform process, which the article assesses through a wide-ranging examination of reform politics in Latin America, Africa, and Eastern Europe. Boolean analysis corroborates most of the predictions derived from prospect theory, but also suggests the importance of economic and political-institutional context factors.\u001b[0m :\n",

Individual decisions about whether or not to cooperate were made on the basis of a simple rule known as \"win-stay, lose-change.\" For each individual, wins and losses were defined in relation to a simulated adaptation level. The rate of adaptation was varied systematically, and we made a distinction between \"upward\" adaptation to gains and \"downward\" adaptation to losses. We found that the overall prevalence of cooperation was determined mainly by the rate of downward adaptation, whereas the rate of upward adaptation had very little effect. Moreover, we found a strongly negative relation between the prevalence of cooperation and the rate of downward adaptation. This latter finding is particularly significant in view of evidence that people generally adapt to losses slowly, for it suggests that slow downward adaptation at the individual level may fuel the survival of cooperation in large groups.\u001b[0m :\n",

Typically, a product mix decision is made by comparing product profit margins and considering nonquantitative criteria including \"carrying a complete line of products\" (Boyd, H.

      "Abstract: Past research demonstrating the fairness-enhancing effects of managerial accounts of controversial organizational decisions typically has confounded two dimensions - whether the manager minimizes personal responsibility for the decision and whether the manager offers a justification legitimizing the decision. We manipulated these two dimensions, within the context of third-party conflict resolution, to determine their independent effects on perceptions of fairness and reactions to the account giver. One hundred thirty-five undergraduate students read a case, written from the perspective of the \"losing\" party, describing a dispute between two employees that was ultimately resolved by a managerial third party in a way that favored one employee over the other. In the case, the manager either minimized personal responsibility for the resolution or assumed responsibility; cross-cutting this manipulation, the manager either provided a justification that appealed to superordinate organizational goals or provided no justification. Results showed that, in conditions in which the manager of fered a justification for the unfavorable resolution, there were positive effects on respondents' perceptions of procedural, interactional, and distributive fairness. In contrast, minimizing responsibility had trade-off effects: Whereas this tactic had a positive effect on interactional fairness perceptions, it had adverse side effects (viz., reducing perceptions of the manager's power and leadership ability). Implications of our findings for theory and research on managerial accounts and the attribution of leadership, as well as for conflict resolution, are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper describes two studies in which individuals were asked both to make choices and indicate the maximum amount they were willing to pay (WTP) for such protective measures. By varying the number of years that the measures provided protection, we observed four different decision strategies that individuals use to determine their maximum WTP. The findings from these experiments strongly suggest that most individuals do not take into account the added benefits of having a protective measure in place over a longer period of time when determining the likelihood of purchasing protection or the maximum price they are willing to pay. The behavior of a relatively small proportion of the subjects was consistent with a discounted utility model. Most subjects were either myopic in their behavior or did not change their maximum WTP as the time horizon changed. Despite the fact that most subjects were insensitive to time changes, they were generally willing to purchase the protective measures. Implications of these results for investment in risk mitigation measures are briefly explored.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research has shown that after decision makers are endowed with an object, they are reluctant to trade it for an alternative item. This endowment effect can be explained by loss aversion, the tendency to weight losses more heavily than gains. Consequently, there is no reluctance to trade when no true loss is involved. Four studies investigated whether reluctance to trade declines when the trade involves less of a loss - specifically, when one item is traded for another very similar item. Three experiments did not reveal a relation between willingness to trade and the similarity between the two items being traded. A fourth experiment, however, indicated that subjects were quite willing to trade for an identical item, less willing to trade for a similar item, and even less willing to trade for a dissimilar item. Thus, reluctance to trade decreased as the similarity between the endowment and the alternative increased. This result suggests that loss aversion is a function not only of the item being lost but also of the trade itself - that is, of the relation between the two items being traded. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Affect research has suggested that in high-risk situations, a positive mood often results in an enhanced sensitivity to losses, leading to strong risk-averse behavior relative to neutral or negative mood, but when a situation is seen as being low risk, a reversal occurs and positive affect will often result in more risk-seeking behavior. It was hypothesized that the simple \"framing\" of a gambling task to emphasize either potential gains or potential losses could act as an affect inducer and would produce similar results. In Experiment 1 the effects of an induced positive or negative affective state on risk-taking behavior in a gambling task were examined. Results replicated the risk-averse/risk-seeking reversal phenomenon described above. In Experiment 2 the affect conditions were replaced with a simple Winning vs. Losing framing manipulation where an instructional emphasis was placed either on accumulating points or avoiding the loss of points. Results demonstrated that a reversal pattern in risk taking like that found in Experiment 1 for affect could also be obtained via this simple framing manipulation. An affective-cognitive model of pre-choice framing and a theoretical link between the effects of framing and the effects of mood manipulation based on mood management theory are presented and discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

The rescue hypothesis questions this claim and maintains that draconian adjustment only finds support if it promises to revert a deep crisis and avert further losses. Data from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela suggest that the rescue hypothesis accounts much better for the initial endorsement of neoliberal shock programs immediately after their enactment. When these shock programs bring about economic stabilization and recovery, targeted social benefits help consolidate support for neoliberalism, which a statistical analysis of the impact of social spending on voting in Argentina's and Peru's presidential elections of 1995 reveals.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore factors that influenced decision making regarding the use and nonuse of long-term care services, with a particular focus on elders' attitudes, values, and beliefs. Tlie sample (N = 27) consisted of high-functional elders recently admitted to nursing homes and community-dwelling, high-risk elders recently diverted from nursing homes following a prescreening program. Data were collected through in-depth, face-to-face, semistructured interviews and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Independence and sense of self were the strongest values to emerge. The attitude of acceptance, both passive and active, helped elders cope with increasing levels of dependency and lifestyle clianges. The desire to be part of decisions, both major life planning and day-to-day choices such as meal planning, was pervasive. Decision making was individualistic and complex. Loss of control was threatening to the sense of self, leaving some elders feeling shortchanged.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It is argued that in order to accommodate experimentally-observed choice patterns, it is not enough to model the utility function as being dependent on changes from a reference wealth point. Instead, individuals should be modeled as treating decisions as part of an identifiable sequence of decisions, and utility should be a function of reference wealth, income so far from the sequence, and payoffs from the current decision. The three-argument utility function allows for risk aversion over gains and risk seeking over losses for the first choice in the sequence, and for the house money and break-even effects in later decisions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article explores the contemporary context in which older people make sense of death; their own and that of other people. It gives a historical perspective on death for the current cohort of older people, identifying four significant catalytic elements; two world wars, a decline in the place of ritual, increased secularisation of society and an emphasis upon individualism. It goes on to look at the changed patterns of health and social care which have been prompted by new medical advances and the rise in the bureaucratic management of care services. The dilemma of choice/constraint confronting older people is epitomised in the issues of private freedom v. public control contained in the debate on euthanasia. This article seeks to challenge the social stereotypes in which sight is lost of the possibilities in old age for personal choice and the opportunity to accommodate grief. Finally, new theoretical perspectives on grief are examined and seen to offer a broader view than is found in classical theories of grief, of what is 'normal' in bereavement. Additionally they propose that support is necessary within natural networks as well as within therapeutic settings; a breakthrough in the normalisation of grief for older people.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The treatment of employees during downsizing and corporate restructuring raises many ethical issues. To provide a common framework for understanding ethical decisions facing organizations delivering the news of dismissal to affected employees, Integrative Social Contracts Theory and the research on social exchange was used to integrate existing research on employee dismissal. Of particular importance was determining the criteria necessary to manage the dismissal process within ethical boundaries. Three basic criteria, which together represent a variety of contractual and transactional obligations, are proposed as necessary for an ethical approach to dismissal; 1) advance warning of the job loss, 2) open communication, and 3) institutionalized support services. The frequency with which organizations meet these criteria is examined using a geographically dispersed, cross-organizational sample of 770 involuntarily displaced professional employees. In addition, the effect of such an ethical approach to dismissal on individual psychological and financial outcomes is examined. Findings are discussed as they relate to the implicit contract between employee and employer and organizations' responsibility to employees during corporate restructuring.\u001b[0m :\n",

This article explains the bias in terms of information asymmetries and the free-rider problem. First, incumbents increase their reelection prospects by biasing policy toward groups that are better able to monitor their activities. Second, because smaller groups are better able to overcome the free-rider problem of costly monitoring, policy will be biased in their favor. Third, the effect of asymmetric monitoring on voter welfare is ambiguous. The inefficiencies created by the policy bias are offset by a positively valued selection bias: Incumbents of above-average quality are more likely to survive voter scrutiny than are low-quality types.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Since more and more family caregivers of persons with HIV disease are parents and grandparents, older persons may be responsible for the well-being of ill or orphaned family members at a time when they may be at risk for their own health and social losses. Researchers conducted qualitative interviews with twenty older minority informal caregivers of HIV-infected persons to explore their experiences with seeking and receiving informal social support. There were two sources of social support: support from family and friends external to the care dyad and support from the relationship with the HIV-positive care recipient. There was very little support sought or received outside the family of the caregivers; this was primarily because their decisions about disclosing the HIV diagnosis precluded their asking for social support specific to the HIV caregiving. From the caregivers' perspective the most common source of support was not \"social\" or human; rather, it was strength that came from their spiritual and religious lives or from within themselves. These findings highlight the social isolation of this population, suggesting the need for more awareness and aggressive outreach from the helping professions. More research is needed to determine how decisions regarding HIV disclosure are made, how caregivers sustain support sources that are not specific to HIV caregiving, and how the strong mutual relationship with the HIV-infected care recipient affects coping and bereavement.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the attention given to quality of life (QOL) in persons with cancer, very little is currently know about QOL in persons with brain tumors. In the past twenty years, less than twenty articles reflect the actual measurement of QOL in adult brain tumor population. The shortage of QOL studies is disturbing considering the slow progress made in extending the life expectancy of many brain tumor patients and the toxicities of many existing treatment protocols. This qualitative study was undertaken to begin to fill the gaps in the existing literature and to more clearly define QOL in persons with brain tumors. The researchers used an exploratory, descriptive design involving semi-structured interviews of adults with brain tumors and their significant others. Twenty-three adults with brain tumors and 21 significant others were interviewed. Data analysis of interview transcripts focused on the identification of key variables contributing to the QOL of adults with brain tumors. Using constant comparative methods, it was found that data could be organized into five thematic categories: (1) The Stigma of a Mind-Body Illness, (2) An Invasive Disease of the Self, (3) My Family has a Brain Tumor, (4) Dealing with the Medical Diplomats, and (5) Quality of Life: No Substitute for Living. These emerging themes provide information which clinicians caring for brain tumor patients can use to provide care and anticipatory guidance. Unique areas for further research elicited in the study include exploration of the \"loss of self\" theme, how persons use their estimations of QOL in decision-making and examination of the balance between the need for survival and maintaining QOL.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Information matrices are often the output produced by a decision support system. These matrices are a common method for expressing a decision situation under different decision-making scenarios. The decisions involved in designing a decision support system to generate the information matrix are important and involve several cost and benefit components. A designer needs guidance in making effective design decisions in this context. Such guidance can be provided by considering the relationships among specific design decisions, costs, and benefits. The general objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive framework for this purpose. This study is the first to develop and present a comprehensive cost-benefit framework for evaluating design decisions for a variety of scenarios. The specific objective of this research is to provide guidance regarding the number of available information dimensions to incorporate in a computer-based decision aid. Simulation experiments are conducted with a completely specified model based on the cost-benefit framework (including needed assumptions) to evaluate how many information dimensions to include for a specific information matrix size to achieve a balance between information use costs and decision quality. Based upon extensive simulation analyses for a hypothetical decision maker, the practical guideline found for designers is to include only the top half of the relevant information dimensions in any specific decision support system. Over a large number of repeating choice decisions, the savings in cognitive effort and information gathering costs clearly offset relatively minor losses in decision quality.\u001b[0m :\n",

The sample consisted of 162 Caucasian community volunteers. Data were obtained from an extensive open-ended interview that was analyzed using content analysis. Respondents were categorized into five groups, according to their success at weight loss: Successful, Always Normal Weight, Underweight, Clinically Successful, and Always Obese. The Clinically Successful and Always Obese were included in the category Unsuccessful Dieter. Reasons given for entering a weight-loss regime included attractiveness or appearance, health, fear, self-esteem issues, age, and competition. For the Successful Dieter, attractiveness and health were the two major motivations. Men and women were similar in their reasons for entering a weight-loss program. The issue of what makes a decision of sufficient importance to maintain weight loss remains unexplained. \"Centrality\" is offered as a possible explanation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective. Compare U.K. and U.S. physicians' judgments of population probabilities of important outcomes of invasive cardiac procedures; and values held by them about risk, uncertainty, regret, and justifiability relevant to utilization of cardiac treatments. Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. University hospital and VA medical center in the United States; two teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom. Participants. 171 housestaff and attendings at U.S. teaching hospitals; 51 physician trainees and consultants at U.K. hospitals. Measures. Judgments of probabilities of severe complications and deaths due to Swan-Ganz catheterization, cardiac catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG); judgments of malpractice risks for case vignettes; Nightingale's risk-aversion instrument; Gerrity's reaction- to-uncertainty instrument; questions about need to justify decisions; responses to case vignettes regarding regret. Results. The U.S. physicians judged rates of two bad outcomes of cardiac procedures (complications due to cardiac catheterization; death due to CABG) to be significantly higher (p ≤ 0.01) than did the U.K. physicians (U.S. medians, 5 and 3.5, respectively; U.K. medians 3 and 2). The median ratio of (risk of malpractice suit I error of omission)/(risk of suit I error of commission) judged by U.K. physicians, 3, was significantly (p = 0.0006) higher than that judged by U.S. physicians, 1.5. The U.K. physicians were less often risk-seeking in the context of possible losses than the U.S. physicians (odds ratio for practicing in the U.K. as a predictor of risk seeking 0.3, p = 0.003). The U.K. physicians had significantly more discomfort with uncertainty than did the U.S. physicians, as reflected by higher scores on the stress scale (U.K. median 48, U.S. 42, p = 0.0001) and the reluctance-to-disclose-uncertainty scale (U.K. 40, U.S. 37, p < 0.0001) of the Gerrity instrument. There was no clear international difference in perceived need to justify decisions, or in regret. Conclusions. The results were not clearly consistent with the uncertainty hypothesis that international practice variation is due to differences in judged rates of outcomes of therapy or with the imperfect-agency hypothesis that practice variation is due to differences in physicians' personal values. The causes and implications of practice variations remain unclear.\u001b[0m :\n",

Between 1 January 1979 and 1 March 1991, 808 consecutive families were enrolled in the Perinatal Mortality Counseling Program at the University of Florida. Following perinatal death, most parents wanted contact with their baby to personalize the event, information about the death and follow-up from their health care providers. However, no option was chosen by all parents. This large study strongly supports offering choices to all parents.

Due to this lack of knowledge which would guide the investigator in the recruitment and retention of Hispanics in research studies, the Hispanic population remains understudied and underserved. This article describes the numerous challenges that were encountered in the actual process of recruiting Hispanic women into a research study which examined adjustment among breast cancer survivors. The rate of refusal to participate was unexpectedly high, which necessitated additional recruitment strategies, including a renewed emphasis on the importance of the study and the option of meeting with other members of the community in a group. Women who refused to participate in the study stated concerns related to a loss of health benefits, the influence of family members, and a recurrence of emotional stress. Instrument issues are also addressed. This learning process of developing, refining, and testing effective methods for recruiting Hispanic women in research studies remains an ongoing endeavor; through these efforts it is hoped that culturally competent health care can become a reality.\u001b[0m :\n",

Several months after the Vancouver conference in 1996, a curious phenomenon was noted. The clinical manifestations included an initial phase of excitement and hope. Then, as patients began to deal with the psychological changes involved in planning a future rather than a funeral, many began (unconsciously or not) to become noncompliant with their medications. In Dallas, physicians validated this phenomenon, some reporting up to 75% noncompliance rates. This article will address the change from a terminally ill person to one that is chronically ill, and the psychological, social, and existential changes that occur during this shift in identity. It will specifically focus on the fears involved with losing support, disability income, having to possibly reenter the work force (after having not worked and losing job skills), the special issues of women with HIV and, finally, the decision that women are making to get pregnant, expecting a normal life span, and, (with the use of multiple drug therapies during pregnancy) having a healthy, noninfected child.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper describes a technique for evaluating the economic efficiency of HIV behavioral risk reduction interventions within a cost-utility analytic framework. To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, standardized values of the lifetime cost of treating HIV/AIDS and the number of quality-adjusted life years lost when someone becomes infected with HIV are combined with information about overall program costs and a model-based estimate of the number of infections averted by the intervention. The use of a standardized economic evaluation methodology for HIV prevention research, such as that proposed here, enhances cross-study comparability and thereby facilitates informed resource allocation decision making.\u001b[0m :\n",

Unfortunately, they often lack this knowledge, and their subsequent actions to cope with systems risk are less effective than they might otherwise be.

The contingent valuation method was employed to measure the economic value of ecotourism resources for recreational use at Mt. Minju in South Korea using a dichotomous choice questionnaire. The empirical results show that the economic value of ecotourism resources per recreationist was estimated at 20,792 won (approximately U.S.$24) and 23,307 won (approximately U.S.$27) using the parametric and nonparametric approaches, respectively, under the hypothetical market scenario. The total economic benefits then were estimated by multiplying the per capita economic benefit by the number of visitors. The findings are sufficient to demonstrate that ecotourism resources as nonmarket goods have their own economic value and have considerable economic benefits.

      "Abstract: Rules in the form of advice can inaccurately state the effects of recommended responses by over-stating or understating size of the consequences. Three experiments investigated the effects of such inaccuracies on patterns of rule control and rule choice with female college students. In Experiment 1, signaled accurate, overstated, or understated rules specified that a given number of points would be earned by pressing a designated key. For some subjects, rules specified a number of points to be gained; for other subjects, rules specified a number of points to be lost from an amount given earlier. Point totals stated in the inaccurate rules averaged 25% more (overstated) or 25% less (understated) than those received. When subjects could choose either the response specified in the rule or an alternative response that produced an unpredictable number of points, they showed greater sensitivity to the inaccuracy of overstated rules than understated rules. In trials at the end of the experiment in which subjects could choose which rule to see, subjects did not always choose accurate rules and often chose inaccurate rules for which they had shown less sensitivity earlier. Experiment 2 replicated this pattern in which subjects could choose which type of rule to see on a greater number of trials. Some evidence suggested that subjects prefer an improvement from the outcomes promised to those later received. In Experiment 3, rules misstated by averages of 25% and 50% were compared. Evidence suggested that increasing the size of the misstatement reduced the discrimination of inaccurate rules from accurate ones.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One of the main difficulties in the development of descriptive models of learning in repeated choice tasks involves the abstraction of the effect of losses. The present paper explains this difficulty, summarizes its common solutions, and presents an experiment that was designed to compare the descriptive power of the specific quantifications of these solutions proposed in recent research. The experiment utilized a probability learning task. In each of the experiment's 500 trials participants were asked to predict the appearance of one of two colors. The probabilities of appearance of the colors were different but fixed during the entire experiment. The experimental manipulation involved an addition of a constant to the payoffs. The results demonstrate that learning in the loss domain can be faster than learning in the gain domain; adding a constant to the payoff matrix can affect the learning process. These results are consistent with Erev & Roth's (1996) adjustable reference point abstraction of the effect of losses, and violate all other models. © 1998 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this paper it is shown that, under assumptions of Prospect Theory, conditions for cooperation are best if dilemmas include both positive and negative outcomes, and that these conditions improve with increasing loss aversion.

      "Abstract: Misuse of computer information systems has caused significant losses to business and society, even though computing has benefited both businesses and professionals. To this end, several measures have been suggested that both prevent and deter losses. One deterrent measure is to identify individual and situational characteristics of people who act ethically/unethically. This study identifies specific char-acteristics that are associated with and may influence the ethical behavior intention of information systems employees when faced with ethical dilemmas. The results of the study show that individual and situational characteristics do influence ethical behavior intention.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Men who pursue active treatment for metastatic prostate cancer face a choice between medical or surgical castration. While both alternatives have documented side-effects (e.g. loss of libido, breast enlargement and tenderness, hot flashes, and nausea), their psychosocial impacts are not well understood. As part of a study of patients' treatment decision making, we have sought to construct a patient-based measure of the salient disease and treatment-related qualities of life experienced by these men subsequent to treatment. Focus groups (15 with patients, two with wives) were used to develop candidate Likert scale questionnaire items representing quality of life issues that patients said were important. These items were combined with assessments of symptoms, comorbidity, and generic measures of functional status and well-being in a mail survey of patients treated at the Houston VAMC and two other Houston hospitals (n = 201, response rate = 63%). Psychometric analyses (principal components and multitrait scaling) were used to identify distinct dimensions of life quality; correlations with generic measures, and symptom reports were used in validation analyses. Qualitative analyses of focus group data identified three major domains of life quality: self-perceptions, anxiety about the effects of treatment, and concern with the process of decision making and treatment. Psychometric analyses identified nine reliable and valid indicators of prostate cancer-related quality of life: body image, sexual problems, spouse affection, spouse worry, masculinity, cancer-related self-image, cancer distress, cancer acceptance, and regret of treatment decision. Internal consistency (alpha) ranged from 0.71 to 0.90. Correlations with reference scales (e.g. MOS Mental Health Index, Profile of Mood States) and symptom status supported concurrent validity. Prostate cancer patients perceive a number of important psychosocial consequences of their treatment. These consequences are represented by nine scales comprising a brief (35 items) disease and treatment sensitive health-related quality of life instrument, which we will use in monitoring the outcomes of patients' treatment choices.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To estimate the likely gains in life expectancy of patients with coronary artery disease treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors based on published reports and the results of the 4S and the West of Scotland Study. Design: Decision analysis. Main outcome: Four likely scenarios of the effect of treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the life expectancy of medically and surgically managed coronary artery disease were modelled. Results: Regardless of the scenario, treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was estimated to provide a gain in life expectancy for medically managed patients of all ages with coronary artery disease, ranging from 4.6 to 10.1 quality adjusted life years (OALYs) for a 40 year old with three vessel disease (depending on the scenario assumed), to 0.2 QALYs for a 80 year old with two vessel disease. These gains were always greater than those predicted after bypass alone. If the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors produces the same reduction in cardiac mortality after bypass as it does in medically managed patients it will increase the benefits of operation except for patients with two vessel disease over 70 years of age. Conversely, if HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors do not influence the course of coronary artery disease after bypass, the benefits of operation over medical treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are either reduced or lost completely, ranging from a loss of -5.6 QALYs for a 41 year old with two vessel disease to a gain of 1.5 QALYs for 55 to 60 year old patients with left main stem disease. Conclusion: Although their effect on the progression of coronary artery disease after bypass must be defined, it is probable that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors will produce considerable gains in life expectancy for patients with coronary artery disease.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Untreated adults (n = 21) with lengthy weight problem histories who had maintained stable weight loss for a mean of 4.5 years were interviewed and completed questionnaires about their motivations for and behavioral strategies used during weight loss. Currently obese, untreated adults (n = 20) served as controls. Successful natural recovery was associated with behavior changes like those emphasized in behavioral weight management programs (e.g., healthier food choices, eating more slowly, regular exercise). Motivations for weight loss were largely negative and reflected appearance and psychosocial concerns. Demographic, weight history, and health variables generally did not distinguish the groups. Obesity treatment was widely available but was viewed negatively. These findings reveal natural processes involved in sustained weight loss, highlight the potential importance of separating influences on behavior change from influences on help-seeking, and suggest ways that obesity treatments could be improved to increase their appeal.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It is proposed that by making sense of unpredictable price movements, rumors spawn anti-regressive predictions and adversely affect trading decisions despite investor denigration of rumors. Two experimental stock market simulations investigated these ideas. Subjects were presented with news (Study 1) and published and unpublished rumors (Study 2) while participating in a computerized investment game. As compared with controls, all manipulations caused departures from a profitable buy-low-sell-high (tracking) trading strategy despite strong differences in rated credibility between types of information source. Subjects claimed that rumor sources were non-credible and that they were not influenced by rumors in trading decisions; nevertheless they traded on rumors as though they were news. Results integrate rumor theory with the psychology of prediction, extend the corpus of rumor literature to behavior, and highlight the sense-making function of rumor in situations filled with uncertainty. © 1997 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although an important aspect of managing new product introductions is to recognize and quickly take action when a product launch has failed (i.e., “pull the plug”), senior managers in a new product launch setting tend to remain committed to a losing course of action. The authors investigate this issue with controlled experiments, using senior level executives as subjects. Their results suggest a strong bias toward continued commitment to failing new products. Consequently, the authors devise and test the effectiveness of five decision aids aimed at reducing this bias. Improving the quality of the information environment does not greatly reduce bias, nor does precommitment (at time of launch) to self-specified decisions rules. The most effective methods of reducing commitment to a losing course of action appear to be either precommitment to a predetermined decision rule or introduction of a new decision maker at the time of the stop/no stop decision. Of these two methods, the latter produces marginally less commitment to a losing course of action. However, none of the tested decision procedures completely reduces commitment to a losing course of action relative to the control condition. © 1997 American Marketing Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper examines an axiomatization of preference relations over these streams that includes preferences which do not satisfy temporal monotonicity, and which leads to a simple functional representation of these preferences. Motivated by the loss-aversion aspects of Tversky and Kahneman's prospect theory, the axioms lead to a representation that takes into account not only the utility of the per-period outcomes (instantaneous payoffs), but also the differences between the utility of pairs of adjacent outcomes, and the direction of the differences (gains or losses). In this framework, loss aversion is defined and characterized. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have an increased risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy are often considered as ways of reducing these risks, but the effect of the procedures on life expectancy has not been established. Methods: In a decision analysis, we compared prophylactic mastectomy and prophylactic oophorectomy with no prophylactic surgery among women who carry mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. We used available data about the incidence of cancer, the prognosis for women with cancer, and the efficacy of prophylactic mastectomy and oophorectomy in preventing breast and ovarian cancer to estimate the effects of these interventions on life expectancy among women with different levels of risk of cancer. Results: We calculated that, on average, 30-year-old women who carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations gain from 2.9 to 5.3 years of life expectancy from prophylactic mastectomy and from 0.3 to 1.7 years of life expectancy from prophylactic oophorectomy, depending on their cumulative risk of cancer. Gains in life expectancy decline with age at the time of prophylactic surgery and are minimal for 60-year-old women. Among 30-year-old women, oophorectomy may be delayed 10 years with little loss of life expectancy. Conclusions: On the basis of a range of estimates of the incidence of cancer, prognosis, and efficacy of prophylactic surgery, our model suggests that prophylactic mastectomy provides substantial gains in life expectancy and prophylactic oophorectomy more limited gains for young women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.\u001b[0m :\n",

Managers from 58 oil industry organizations were presented with hypothetical business decisions involving significant gains and losses, and asked to choose between action alternatives resulting in certain outcomes or probabilistic outcomes. Also evaluates the notion that tendencies towards risk taking are complex, reflecting personality traits, habits and experience. There was support for a historical basis for risk propensity, but risk preferences were not found to be influential. Further, although both risk propensity and problem framing were found to be significant predictors of risk behaviour, there was no support for prospect theory predictions.

To discriminate the respective participation of the cerebellar cortex and deep structures in learning and memory, the authors subjected 3- to 6-month-old +/Lc mice to a delayed spontaneous alternation task to test their working and long-term spatial memories. Results show that wild type (+/+) mice alternated above chance even after a 1-hr delay between the forced and choice trials, whereas in +/Lc mice, long- term memory was impaired. Cerebellectomized +/+ mice behave as +/Lc mice (working memory was preserved but long-term memory was not), whereas in the cerebellectomized +/Lc mice, both working and long-term memories were altered.

      "Abstract: On December 6, 1994, Orange County became the largest municipality ever to file for bankruptcy. This dramatic action was prompted by a loss of $1.64 billion on the Orange County Investment Pool that became \"realized\" as the pool was liquidated. This study provides an update to the Orange County situation and discusses whether the bankruptcy and liquidation were necessary. The bankruptcy decision seems to be justified by the fact that the county was facing liabilities far in excess of its assets. Indeed, the bankruptcy court has ruled that the county's petition was entirely appropriate as it was insolvent at the time of the filing. The liquidation decision, however, involved a substantial opportunity loss, as the subsequent drop in interest rates would have led to a recovery of the portfolio Whether liquidation was appropriate cannot be judged by the path of interest rates after the fact. The article illustrates how the value at risk methodology could have been used to estimate the risks of the portfolio prior to the facts. By December 1994, there was an estimated 5% probability that the portfolio would suffer a further loss of $1.1 billion or more over the following year.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Multiplicative-summing decision theories were compared by assessing their fit to choice data obtained from 559 subjects, each providing 16-60 problems. The problems were 212 pairs of multioutcome monetary lotteries, including 86 for gains, 86 for losses, and 40 mixed lotteries with gains and losses. Lotteries of each pair had the same expected value. The fit of each theory to the data was measured by the percent of problems with agreement between the observed majority preference and the lottery with the higher calculated expected utility (or Value); 'percent concordance' indicates percent of agreement. Parameter fitting showed that a linear probability function provided excellent representation of the data, and was superior to the rank-dependent weighted probability functions of cumulative prospect theory. Modeling is successful when the utility function is S-shaped, concave in the gain and convex in the loss domains, across a wide range of curvatures (from u(x) = x0.05 to x0.85). Surprisingly, the best modeling was with severe curvature (u(x) = x0.05). Addition of loss aversion to the model and steeper slopes for losses than for gains provided no or very little increases of concordances between theory and data. Conclusions are that for this data set of choices between multioutcome monetary lotteries, the most descriptive of the multiplicative-summing theories was a hybrid model which combines the linear probability of classical expected utility and a symmetrical S-shaped utility function borrowed from cumulative prospect theory. A rank-dependent weighted probability function did not improve the fit of model to data. Variance modeling also described choices very well. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

By modifying a study by Wakker, Erev, and Weber (1994) we show that all three processes - that is, perceptual biases, individual predispositions in weighting, as well as rational adaptation to an asymmetric loss function - can be involved in rank-dependent weighting.\u001b[0m :\n",

In both cases, the distance of the average loss from a set, in repeated plays of the game, was proved to converge to O with probability one. In both cases, we show that the rate of the convergence is better than (n/log1+t n)-1/2 for every positive t, obtain bounds for the L2 norm of the distance and extend the results to cases in which past losses and actions are only estimated.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: While considerable research has focused on the neurotoxicity of developmental exposures to polychlorinated biphenyls, including Aroclor 1254, relatively little is known about exposures in adult animals. This study investigated the behavioral effects of acute and repeated Aroclor 1254 exposures to adult rats on motor activity and flavor aversion conditioning. Male Long-Evans rats (60 days old) were tested for motor activity in a photocell device after acute (0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg, po) or repeated (0, 1, 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg/day, po, 5 days/week for 4 to 6 weeks) exposure to Aroclor 1254. Motor activity was decreased dose-dependently at doses of 300 mg/kg or more after acute exposure. Severe body weight loss and deaths occurred at 1000 mg/kg. Recovery of activity occurred over 9 weeks but was incomplete. After repeated exposure, motor activity was decreased dose-dependently at doses of 30 mg/kg or more, and severe weight loss and deaths occurred at 100 mg/kg. In contrast to acute exposure, complete recovery of activity occurred 3 weeks after exposure. Additional rats were water deprived (30 min/day) and received acute po administration of Aroclor 1254 (0, 10, 15, 25, 30, 100, or 300 mg/kg) shortly after consuming a saccharin solution. Three days later they were given the choice between consuming saccharin or water, and saccharin preferences were recorded. Saccharin preference was decreased at doses of 25 mg/kg or more. Additional experiments determined the effect of repeated saccharin-Aroclor 1254 pairings (0, 3.75, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg/day, 14 days) followed by a choice test 1 day after the last dose. Repeated exposure to 15 mg/kg produced robust flavor aversion conditioning. Repeated exposure to 7.5 mglkg produced flavor aversion conditioning in four of 12 rats. These results demonstrate that Aroclor 1254 causes hypoactivity and flavor aversions in adult rats; the no observable effect level (NOEL) for motor activity was 100 mg/kg for acute exposure and 10 mg/kg for repeated exposure for a period of up to 6 weeks. The acute NOEL for flavor aversion conditioning was 15 mg/kg while the repeated NOEL was 7.5 mg/kg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The life-cycle theory of saving behavior (Modigliani, 1988) suggests that humans strive towards an equal intertemporal distribution of wealth. However, behavioral life-cycle theory (Shefrin & Thaler, 1988) proposes that people use self-control heuristics to postpone wealth until later in life. According to this theory, people use a system of cognitive budgeting known as mental accounting. In the present study it was found that mental accounts were used differently depending on if the income change was positive or negative. This was shown both in a representative nationwide sample of households and in a student sample. Respondents were more willing to cut down on their propensity to consume when faced with an income decrease than to raise it when the income increased. Furthermore, contrary to the predictions of behavioral life-cycle theory, it was found that the respondents adjusted their propensity to consume the most when the income increases or decreases took place immediately. Hence, it is suggested that theories of intertemporal choice (e.g., Loewenstein, 1988; Loewenstein & Prelec, 1992) provide a better account of the data than does the behavioral lifecycle theory. © 1997 JAI Press, Inc.

      "Abstract: This paper examines the self-reported effects of alkyl nitrite use. The aim of this research into the social contextual use of nitrites was to provide qualitative data to assist with policy-making decisions and to inform the development of preventative and harm minimisation interventions. A wide variety of short term adverse effects were described by the study participants. These included headaches, minor burns, respiratory problems, lack of co-ordination and balance, contact dermatitis, nausea, tachycardia, blurred vision and lethargy. No one had experienced any long term side effects. There was a general assumption amongst respondents that nitrites must have detrimental effects on health, but in general they felt ill-informed about potential side effects. A range of adverse effects on mood were described. These included: depression, short term memory loss, aggression, panic and dependence. Research has suggested a link between the use of alkyl nitrite and sexual activity, including high rates of use amongst gay men involved in casual and high risk sex. This paper looks at the link between alkyl nitirte use and sexual activity and behaviour in a variety of populations. There was evidence of differing patterns of nitrite use according to sexual orientation. Health care professionals, especially those working in genito-urinary clinics, need to be aware of the social and sexual contexts in which nitrites are used.\u001b[0m :\n",

Posner proposed a method, based upon economic assumptions, that he argues will liberate the appellate courts from the deluge of recent civil appeals. Because Posner’s model has played such an important theoretical and practical role in how we view the decision of losing litigants to appeal, the validity of the model and the real role of economic constraints have important implications. Using empirical research, I tested the validity of Posner’s model and I propose that economic considerations are not the primary motivations in losing litigants’ decision to appeal. I argue that, if Posner’s model is flawed, using this model may not only fail to decrease appellate case filings but could actually harm the legitimacy of the judiciary. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

Hypotheses concerning the effects of the reference point on risk preferences in group decision making were tested by content analyzing transcripts of Japanese leaders' deliberations prior to their 1941 decision for war and subsequent attack on Pearl Harbor. Consistent with prospect theory, the results show systematic associations between the reference point used and the riskiness of policy recommendations. The highly risky decision for war appears to have been influenced by the group's reference point, which framed the group's alternatives as a choice between losses.

      "Abstract: This article synthesizes some recent progress in the theories of corporate control and political lobbying to model the proxy campaign as a political campaign. The model yields a number of testable implications, only some of which have been examined in the literature. For example, if the loss from voting for a \"bad\" dissident exceeds the gain from voting for a \"good\" dissident, the model predicts that as communication costs fall, the number of proxy fights increases, announcement day returns decrease, and the fraction of dissident wins first increases and then decreases.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous North American research suggests that aspects of agency theory and prospect theory may explain decisions to escalate commitment to failing projects. This study explores the universality of these theories in this context. The willingness of North American and Asian managers to escalate commitment to losing projects was measured using four go/no-go decision cases. We hypothesized that Asian managers would be less willing to act in their self-interest (a lower agency effect), and would be more willing to escalate a decision in the face of negative framing (a stronger framing effect). We found that agency theory had strong explanatory power for project in our Asian sample. Framing effects were significant in both, but they were not significantly different. © 1997, Academy of International Business. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although an important aspect of managing new product introductions is to recognize and quickly take action when a product launch has failed (i.e., \"pull the plug\"), senior managers in a new product launch setting tend to remain committed to a losing course of action. The authors investigate this issue with controlled experiments, using senior level executives as subjects. Their results suggest a strong bias toward continued commitment to failing new products. Consequently, the authors devise and test the effectiveness of five decision aids aimed at reducing this bias. Improving the quality of the information environment does not greatly reduce bias, nor does precommitment (at time of launch) to self-specified decisions rules. The most effective methods of reducing commitment to a losing course of action appear to be either precommitment to a predetermined decision rule or introduction of a new decision maker at the time of the stop/no stop decision. Of these two methods, the latter produces marginally less commitment to a losing course of action. However, none of the tested decision procedures completely reduces commitment to a losing course of action relative to the control condition.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The author describes the impact on her clinical practice of a 10-year struggle with recurrent breast cancer. Informed by tales of therapists who kept their disease secret and thus deprived patients of the experience of saying good-bye, she explores a process of clinical decision making involving self-disclosure and the clinical indications that patients were ready and wanted to learn about her illness. Nonverbal communications from patients, relevant history of disease in friends and relatives, and parallel experiences with others in their current lives were among the indications cited for self-disclosure about cancer. In clinical vignettes, the author explores her process of deciding who and when to tell, and the subsequent work of helping patients deal with the information and potential loss. She considers as well decisions about accepting new patients, countertransference challenges regarding her illness, and the authenticity that self-disclosure provides in allowing patients to determine for themselves whether or not to continue or terminate treatment.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The sunk cost effect refers to the empirical finding that people tend to let their decisions be influenced by costs made at an earlier time in such a way that they are more risk seeking than they would be had they not made these costs. This finding seems to be in conflict with economic theory which implies that only incremental costs and benefits should affect decisions. The effect is often explained in terms of prospect theory of (Kahneman, D., Tversky, A., 1979. Prospect theory: An analysis of decision under risk. Econometrica 47, 263-291), suggesting that sunk costs may induce a 'loss frame,' consequently causing risk seeking behavior. We argue that sunk costs may also result in risk aversion. In the present study we investigated the effect of time and effort investments (Behavioral Sunk Costs) on risky decision making in gain and loss situations. The results show that, in agreement with prospect theory, participants were more risk averse in gain situations than in loss situations. Moreover, incurring Behavioral Sunk Costs appeared to increase risk aversive choices, i.e., a reverse sunk cost effect. Furthermore, the results suggest that, in loss situations, Behavioral Sunk Costs mainly lead to risk aversive behavior if opting for the 'safe' alternative is not accompanied by an increased possibility to regret the decision. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: National leaders confront risky decisions on a regular basis. Although leaders may differ widely in their tolerance for risk, students of foreign policymaking lack compelling explanations for these differences. One of the few attempts to grapple with this problem holds that decision makers accept risks to avoid losses but refuse to take risks to make comparable gains. This tendency, embodied in prospect theory, is experimentally robust but consistently fails to predict the behavior of one third or more of the subjects. To investigate the contribution of individual differences to risk taking, the authors administered three questionnaires assessing risk propensity and two personality inventories (the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and the Revised NEO Personality Inventory) to 126 subjects. The results identify strong personality predictors of generalized risk taking. Contrary to prospect theory, some people were especially willing to take risks to make gains, whereas others were particularly unlikely to take risks when facing potential losses. Statistical analyses lend support to a three-stage model of risk taking. The findings suggest that if students of international conflict want to understand risk taking, then they must consider not only how leaders frame conflicts but also the character of the leaders themselves.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper demonstrates the risk of this practice by comparing the effect of message framing in a laboratory environment to its effect in a real environment. It is shown that in a laboratory environment, a loss message (e.g., if you will not buy the product, you will lose the following benefits...) is more persuasive than a gain framing (e.g., if you will by the product, you will gain the following benefits...) On the other hand, in a natural environment, a gain message is more persuasive than a loss message. It is suggested that involvement mediates this effect of framing on persuasion.

      "Abstract: This paper provides empirical evidence that distinguishes between alternative conceptualizations of the risky decision making process. Two studies investigate whether cross-situational differences in choice behavior should be interpreted in the expected utility framework as differences in risk attitude (as measured by risk-averse vs. risk-seeking utility functions) or as differences in the perception of the relative riskiness of choice alternatives as permitted by risk-return interpretations of utility functions, leaving open the possibility of stable cross-situational risk preference as a personality trait. To this end, we propose a way of assessing a person's inherent risk preference that factors out individual and situational differences in risk perception. We document that a definition of risk aversion and risk seeking as the preference for options perceived to be more risky or less risky, respectively, provides the cross-situational stability to a person's risk preference that has eluded more traditional definitions. In Experiment 1, commuters changed their preferences for trains with risky arrival times when the alternatives involved gains in commuting time rather than losses. However, changes in preference coincided with changes in the perception of the riskiness of the choice alternatives, leaving the perceived risk attitudes of a majority of commuters unchanged. Experiment 2, a stockmarket investment task, investigated changes in risk perception, information acquisition, and stock selection as a function of outcome feedback. Investors' stock selections and their perception of the risk of the same stocks were different in a series of decisions in which they lost money than in a series in which they made money. As in Experiment 1, differences in choice and in risk perception were systematically related, such that the majority of investors had the same preference for perceived risk in both series of decisions. Our results provide empirical support for the usefulness of recent risk-return conceptualizations of risky choice (Bell 1995, Jia and Dyer 1994, M. Weber and Sarin 1993).\u001b[0m :\n",

The gambler faces a sequence of two-outcome games, i.e., \"win\" vs. \"lose,\" and wishes to maximize the expected value of his terminal utility. It has been shown by Kelly, Bellman, and others that if the terminal utility is of the form log x, where x is the terminal wealth, then the optimal policy is myopic, i.e., the optimal wager is always to bet a constant fraction of the wealth provided that the probability of winning exceeds the probability of losing. In this paper we provide a critique of the simple logarithmic assumption for the utility of terminal wealth and solve the problem with a more general utility function. We show that in the general case, the optimal policy is not myopic, and we provide analytic expressions for optimal wager decisions in terms of the problem parameters. We also provide conditions under which the optimal policy reduces to the simple myopic case. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Continuing the search, this study investigated self-efficacy judgments as a potentially important individual difference in escalating commitment to a losing course of action. Predictions derived from self-efficacy theory suggest that self-percepts of high efficacy would exacerbate the economically irrational escalation bias whereas self-percepts of low efficacy would diminish it. These predictions were consistently supported in this laboratory study where business students responded to decision dilemmas in which funds had been committed to a failing course of action.

The aim of this study was to describe caregivers who develop or experience burnout (group A) and caregivers without experience of burnout (group B) and how they cope with major strain. The interviews focused on the caregivers' descriptions of their major strain (the demented person's memory difficulties and change in behaviour and the caregivers' experiences of their feelings of loss and their new role) and what they did, thought and felt in these situations. The interviews were coded and categorized and a chi-square test was performed. It was found that those in group A more often used an emotion-focused strategy (grieving, worrying and self-accusation). They were also the only ones using wishful thinking and stoicism as strategies. Those in group B used a problem-focused strategy more often (confronting the problem, seeking information and seeking social support). Another interesting finding was that the caregivers in group B frequently used the emotion-focused strategy of acceptance in combination with seeking information and seeking social support. To mix approaches like these seems to be an effective choice of strategy. It was also found that the caregivers' gender seems to have an effect on the coping strategy. The demented person's domicile did not, however, appear to result in any significant difference.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Most real-world risky decisions are based on imprecise probabilities. Although people generally demonstrate vagueness aversion, behaving as if vaguely specified probabilities are worse than comparable precisely specified probabilities, vagueness seeking also occurs. Previous explanations of vagueness preferences have been based on individual differences and regressive beliefs about extreme probabilities, and little research has examined the effect of changes in the way vagueness is communicated to the decision maker. The present study demonstrates that gain/loss framing, moderated by the operationalization of vagueness, influences how people respond to vagueness about a probability estimate. Subjects read scenarios describing consumer purchases, organizational marketing decisions, and medical treatments, and expressed preference between options having either precisely or vaguely described probabilities. Vagueness was operationalized either as a range of possible values or as verbal qualification of a single point estimate. Negative framing was associated with greater preference for vague prospects, unless vagueness was described by a numerical range with the higher value presented first, indicating a substantial primacy order effect. A second experiment demonstrates that negative framing led people to make more favorable inferences about the likelihoods of vague probabilities. © 1997 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To assess the quality of life after treatment for limb-threatening ischaemia. Design: An open, prospective, observational study in a Vascular Unit of a University Hospital. Materials: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients presenting with actual or threatened tissue loss of the leg. Methods: A single, experienced observer assessed the patients for pain, mobility, anxiety, depression, self-care and lifestyle at presentation, 6 and 12 months later. Results: Six different treatment outcomes were recognised: successful angioplasty, successful thrombolysis/thrombectomy, successful surgical bypass, amputation after failed revascularisation, primary unilateral amputation and primary bilateral amputation. Pain was significantly improved in all groups (p < 0.05) except for patients after failed revascularisation (p = 0.08). Mobility improved in patients who underwent angioplasty (p = 0.05) or a successful surgical bypass (p = 0.001). Anxiety and depression both improved significantly only after surgical reconstruction (p < 0.02). Self-care ability improved significantly after angioplasty (p < 0.05), surgical reconstruction (p < 0.005) and unilateral primary amputation (p < 0.05), but was unaltered in the other groups. Lifestyle significantly deteriorated following thrombolysis/thrombectomy and failed surgical reconstruction (p < 0.05), but was maintained in all other groups. Conclusions: The treatment of limb-threatening ischaemia should aim to maintain pre-morbid lifestyle, an aim which is best achieved by limb-salvage.

      "Abstract: Before designing an intervention to assist women in making informed decisions about BRCA1 testing, we conducted focus groups with women who had breast cancer and unaffected women whose relatives had it to better understand women's knowledge, concerns about testing, and potential influences and support needs in making a decision about genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer. Findings show a general lack of knowledge about genetic testing for breast cancer and what it means to have a positive test result, a strong concern for family members, particularly daughters, to use information from testing to help them make better decisions about their health and lifestyle choices, a strong sense of altruism, particularly among affected women, about being tested to help other women, not just family, and various support needs surrounding the testing experience, including an active role for physicians in the decision process. The major advantages to testing seem to be for information that could help reduce uncertainty and assist with making future decisions about medical treatment and plans for surveillance and some lifestyle changes. The major disadvantages to testing were concerns about confidentiality and loss of insurance, the lack of proven options for women after testing, and stress from knowing one had the BRCA1 mutation. These focus group discussions show women's concerns and ambivalence about genetic testing. We need to provide women with balanced information about the positive and negative aspects of such testing, determine how best to involve physicians in women's decisions about testing, consider the effects of testing on family relationships, and provide more public education about what genetic testing is and what it means.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The effect of monetary contingencies on alprazolam self-administration was evaluated in seven male volunteers living in a residential laboratory. Drug administration occurred prior to an afternoon work session (13.00 h), and at the onset of an evening recreation period (17.30 h). On 'sample' days, participants were administered placebo or alprazolam (0.75 mg), and at the end of the afternoon work session, were told whether their task performance was 'better' or 'worse' than average. If they received 'better' feedback they earned $55, and if they received 'worse' feedback, they earned $15. On 'choice' days, participants chose to self-administer either alprazolam or placebo, with feedback occurring on two of the four choice days. Feedback was not actually linked to performance, but instead was pre-programmed. For one week, alprazolam administration was always associated with 'better' feedback on sample and choice days, and in the other week was associated with 'worse' feedback. When no feedback was delivered, alprazolam was self-administered equally often in the afternoon (57%) and evening (71%). When feedback was delivered, it significantly influenced the choice to self-administer alprazolam in the afternoon. 'Better than average' feedback resulted in alprazolam self-administration 57% of the time, but alprazolam self-administration decreased to 14% when it was associated with 'worse than average' feedback and reduced earnings. A similar pattern of effects has been reported for d-amphetamine. Thus, the self-administration of either a stimulant or a minor tranquilizer is significantly reduced when it is associated with a consequent loss of an alternative reinforcer, in this case money.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A study of the cost of malaria at the household level, community perceptions, preventive measures and illness behaviour linked to the disease was undertaken in 5 villages in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The surveyed community had a high knowledge of malaria, although side effects of antimalarial drugs were often confused with symptoms of the disease. The community sought prompt diagnosis and treatment at 'western-type' facilities, with 84% making use of government facilities as their first choice and 16% preferring private facilities. The preventive measures used were burning coils (54% of families) and special leaves (69% of families), and 93% of the families had their houses sprayed with insecticides. Average direct expenditure on a single malaria episode was US$3, with some families spending more than 10% of the annual household net income per episode. The highest expenditure was on special diets for the sick person, to neutralize the perceived heating effect of the disease and its treatment.; Knowledge of community perceptions of malaria, treatment-seeking behaviors, and the household costs of illness is essential to the planning of sustainable malaria control interventions. These factors were investigated in household surveys conducted in 5 villages in Sri Lanka's dry zone in February 1995. 95% of the 216 families interviewed regarded malaria as their main health problem, followed by diarrhea and eye diseases. Malaria was ranked as the third most important community concern, following lack of water for cultivation and poverty. Overall knowledge of malaria's causes, symptoms, and treatment was high, although the side effects of antimalarial drugs were often confused with symptoms of the disease. Reported for the 3-month period preceding the survey were 178 episodes of malaria involving 160 families. Home treatment with paracetamol was the first step taken in 85% of cases; however, all families sought prompt treatment from Western-type facilities, especially government hospitals (48%) and mobile clinics (30%). No families consulted indigenous or ayurvedic physicians, despite their availability in the area. This utilization of prompt, effective treatment is presumed to reflect high knowledge about malaria, the perceived seriousness of the disease, and good transport facilities in the area. The total direct expenditure on a single episode of malaria averaged US $3; the median net annual income was $258. Special foods for malaria patients aimed at neutralizing the perceived heating effect of malaria and antimalarial drugs (e.g., sodas, oranges) were the most costly item. Adults lost an average of 7.8 days of work per episode and those accompanying them to health facilities lost 2.9 days. Preventive measures used by families included bed nets (23%), mosquito coils (54%), and insecticides (93%).\u001b[0m :\n",

These all share the shortcoming of focusing only on extreme outcomes. This paper suggests an alternative approach of 'tempered regrets' which may more closely replicate the decision process of individuals in those situations in which avoiding the worst outcome tempers the loss from not achieving the best outcome.

      "Abstract: A group of 125 drug abusers admitted consecutively for detoxification and short-term rehabilitation were followed up 5 years after discharge. They were asked about possible suicide attempts in a semi-structured face-to-face interview. Nearly half of the group (45%) reported having attempted suicide at some point in their life. The most common reasons given were the loss of a person whom they loved, and feelings of loneliness. Only three respondents reported using their drug of choice in the attempt(s). The suicide attempters were more often found to have been in child psychiatric treatment earlier, and to have experienced loss of significant others in childhood, than those who did not report attempting suicide. At follow-up the suicide attempters indicated that they experienced more depressive moods and more severe psychological problems than those who had never made a suicide attempt. The importance of assessing the risk of suicide attempts among drug addicts in order to be able to take measures to prevent future suicidal behaviour is emphasized.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Health-relevant communications can be framed in terms of the benefits (gains) or costs (losses) associated with a particular behavior, and the framing of such persuasive messages influences health decision making. Although to ask people to consider a health issue in terms of associated costs is considered an effective way to motivate behavior, empirical findings are inconsistent. In evaluating the effectiveness of framed health messages, investigators must appreciate the context in which health-related decisions are made. The influence of framed information on decision making is contingent on people, first, internalizing the advocated frame and, then, on the degree to which performing a health behavior is perceived as risky. The relative effectiveness of gain-framed or loss-framed appeals depends, in part, on whether a behavior serves an illness-detecting or a health-affirming function. Finally, the authors discuss the cognitive and affective processes that may mediate the influence of framed information on judgment and behavior.

      "Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the content of adolescent thinking about the consequences of choosing abstinence, sexual intercourse with a condom, and unprotected intercourse. Consequences for the relationship and for each partner's thoughts and feelings were explored. Participants were 116 high school students living in a rural area of a midwestern state; their average age was 16 years. They completed a series of open-ended questions about possible outcomes to a scenario involving sexual decision making. Content analysis of responses revealed that about half of the participants associated abstinence with positive consequences; however, it was also associated with insecurity and the possibility of losing the relationship. Sexual intercourse with a condom was viewed as an indication of caring and responsibility and was associated with positive outcomes for the relationship. Identified consequences of unprotected intercourse were almost entirely negative. Some differences in perceived consequences were influenced by the gender of the partner. Integration of these findings into programs designed to prevent sexual risk-taking is discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The negative affect associated with bad decision outcomes is often thought to involve feelings of remorse or self-blame. For example, studies showing greater regret associated with active than with passive choice are interpreted as the active chooser piling self-recrimination on top the disappointment of a poor outcome. Corresponding rejoicing is postulated for active choice that leads to good outcomes. The five experiments reported here challenge such a view. In each, hypothetical individuals experienced identical gains or losses, some as a result of their own choice, others as a result of an external, arbitrary process. Though evaluations of final outcomes were heavily influenced by the paths by which the outcomes were reached, and by the comparison levels that were evoked, in no case was decision agency a significant influence. In these experiments, then, the \"active chooser\" effect appears more a matter of change than of choice, of the route taken rather than whether one is the driver or the passenger. Further research will be needed to establish the circumstances under which different salient comparisons are evoked. © 1997 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A half-decade after the first systematic applications of prospect theory to international relations, scholars continue to debate its potential utility as a theoretical framework. Key questions include the validity of the experimental findings themselves, their relevance for real-world international behavior that involves high-stakes decisions by collective actors in interactive settings, and the conceptual status of prospect theory with respect to rational choice. In this essay I assess theoretical and methodological debates over these issues. I review work in social psychology and experimental economics and conclude that challenges to the external validity of prospect theory-based hypotheses for international behavior are much more serious than challenges to their internal validity. I emphasize the similarities between prospect theory and expected-utility theory, argue that hypotheses regarding loss aversion and the reflection effect are easily subsumed within the latter, and that evidence of framing effects and nonlinear responses to probabilities are more problematic for the theory. I conclude that priorities for future research include the construction of hypotheses on the framing of foreign policy decisions and research designs for testing them; the incorporation of framing, loss aversion, and the reflection effect into theories of collective and interactive decision making; and experimental research that is sensitive to the political and strategic context of foreign policy decision making.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The problem of orphans is serious in sub-Saharan Africa and has been increasing with the deaths of both parents from AIDS. A study of six districts of Uganda conducted in 1992 investigated the problem. Almost all the orphans are cared for by their extended family members who made the decisions to do so. It is recommended that more assistance be given to the family to enhance its capacity to cope with increased orphans expected in the future.; Excess mortality due to AIDS is causing the number of orphans and proportion of orphaned children in sub-Saharan Africa to grow daily. Uganda's 1991 population and housing census identified 1,037,228 children under age 18 years who had lost at least one parent, comprising 11.6% of all children in the same age group. 48,962 boys and 47,886 girls had lost both parents. Findings are presented from the analysis of survey data collected during 1992-93 in Iganga, Mbale, Masaka, Mbarara, Kabale, and Hoima districts. There were 4502 orphans under age 18 years in the districts, for an overall orphanhood prevalence rate of 42.7%. Masaka had the highest rate at 64.0%, while Mbarara had the lowest at 21.9%. The average number of orphans per household in the sample was 2.8. Almost all of the orphans are being cared for by their extended family members. More help should be given to families to enable them to better cope with the increased number of orphans expected in the future.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An experiment was conducted to contrast cognitive and motivational explanations of why a decision maker integrates a prior outcome with the expected outcomes of a current choice. Undergraduate students imagined that, on a fictitious day at a racetrack, they did not gamble in the prior race, that they gambled and won, or that they gambled and lost. Subjects rated in one session the likelihood of choosing to gamble in the current race. In another session, they rated how satisfied they would be with not gambling, with gambling and winning, and with gambling and losing, respectively. In support of a concreteness principle based on the assumption that cognitive effort is minimised, the results showed more integration of the prior outcome for descriptions of the bets which concretely integrated the prior outcomes with all the outcomes of the current choice than for descriptions which did not do that. A motivational explanation labelled the \"loss-sensitivity principle\" was also empirically supported in that, irrespective of concreteness of the descriptions, the prior outcome was always integrated with the expected loss of the current choice.\u001b[0m :\n",

Undergraduate students participating as subjects imagined that they on a fictitious betting day at a horse-race track did not gamble in the prior race, that they gambled and won, or that they gambled and lost. Subjects rated in one session the likelihood of gambling in the current race. In another session they rated how satisfied they would be with not gambling, with winning, and with losing, respectively. The results of Experiment 1 showed that as compared to no prior outcome the ratings of likelihood of gambling increased after a gain and decreased after a loss. This was explained by the assumption, supported by the ratings of satisfaction, that the prior outcome only affected the satisfaction with the expected loss of the current choice, making it less negative after a gain and more negative after a loss. These results were replicated in Experiment 2. In addition, if subjects did not know with certainty the outcome of a previous choice to gamble, the liklihood to accept the current gamble and the ratings of the satisfaction with its expected outcomes were largely unaffected.\u001b[0m :\n",

Population, formal and informal caregivers in the United States. A sample of 14 was studied between 1992 and 1994. Methods: Data were collected in open-ended interviews, then were coded and analyzed using grounded-theory methods. Credibility and fittingness were established. Results: Caregivers who balance engagement and detachment can affect outcomes without needing to control outcomes. Such caregivers are pragmatic and make conscious choices based on their emotional needs. They set and maintain limits and boundaries and are able to monitor the balancing process while recognizing the importance of practicing self-care. Conclusions: The longer and more intense a caregiver's involvement, the more important it is to learn to balance engagement and detachment. Caregivers may need to learn effective balancing skills.\u001b[0m :\n",

Methods: In-depth interviews with 100 mothers and fathers and 2 grandmother care providers were conducted at Pediatrie Hospitals and Care Centres throughout Canada by clinical social workers thit applied both qualitative and quantitative methods.This survey study examined complex family configurations where HIV status of individual family members included parents ant) children who could be infected, non-infected, or indeterminate and individuals whose he.alth status was currently well or ill.The concerns and needs of parents and care providers ere identified within a biopsychosocial framework. Results: This study identified the personal concerns arid rated needs of parents and family care providers living witl i family HIV Profound effects of HIV on families were identified including parent's emotional responses, ways parents coped with multiple losses, the multiple Stressors on mother-i, the experiences of parents living with uncertainty over the health and life expectancy of families members, parents' future planning and disclosure issues, and couple issues and tensions.These multiple issues often occur in the context of parents faced with severe economic pressures while attempting to care for ill and well family members in secrecy and isolation. Parents/families used various coping styles and developed unique coping strategies to provide them with hope and give meaning to their lives. In 90% of cases, disclosure to family, friends, and others was described as becoming closer or remaining the same: patterns of parent; disclosure strategies were identified. Conclusions: Parents first need a guarantee of economic support for their families to lessen stress and allow them to deal with many personal and family issues. f<egardless of whether parents chose to disclose or not disclose, there were good and bad aspects to their decisions. Health and social service providers need to team about parents' coping styles and strategies to build trust and support parents as they stabilize their lives and take control: they need to take a proactive and creative role to ensure appropriate services and networks of support are available in the event of both gradual and unexpected changes in the health status of family members, especially mothers.\u001b[0m :\n",

Yet the numbers of families affected by multiple AIDS-related loss continues to grow along with the numbers of AIDS-related deaths. This disaster offers an opportunity to appreciate the importance of families of choice as an alternative or augmentation to families of origin. Multiple AIDS- related loss affects many families, most severely the families of hemophiliacs, homosexuals, and intravenous drug users. Family therapists are in an ideal position to help families cope with multiple loss and should be aware of the unique concerns faced by survivors.

These estimates were used to supplement standard reconnaissance procedures and expedite decisions which in previous disasters were delayed until observational assessments had been completed. Based on extensive, in-depth interviews with state and federal emergency managers, this paper will focus on how these estimates were used in making decisions. Methods and models employed in generating estimates will be addressed only briefly.

A systematic approach to collect such data is needed to produce accurate information upon which right decisions can be taken. In this study, a sample of 822 traffic accidents occurred in the Riyadh area during 1411H, was considered. Data collected from this sample included general characteristics of the accidents as well as the associated medical consequences of those accidents. General statistics on different types of accidents such as fatalities per accident, fatalities per passenger, injuries per accident and injuries per passenger were calculated. Medical consequences associated with the sample accidents were identified in terms of the distribution of injuries on nine main body locations. This was done for both the injury and fatality cases of each accident type. The results indicated that the average rate of fatalities per accident is about 0.19 which is relatively higher than the reported figure. The results also indicated that head, chest and legs injuries are the most frequent types of injuries. © 1996 (A.H. 1416) King Saud University\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We extend existing audit opinion models by incorporating economic tradeoffs that arise in the auditor's qualification (modification) decision. Prior qualification studies (e.g., Dopuch, Holthausen, and Leftwich [1987]; Bell and Tabor [1991]) do not investigate whether the opinion issued is influenced by particular trade-offs facing an auditor. On the one hand, the audit firm faces the risk of losing the client if it issues a qualification, and on the other, failing to qualify exposes the auditor to lawsuits and reputation loss. We model the auditor's qualification decision as a two-stage model. We estimate a bivariate model that breaks down the probability of qualifying into two components: (1) the probability that the client deserves a qualified opinion based on the audit and (2) the probability that the auditor reports a qualified opinion, given the auditor considers that the client deserves such an opinion. We hypothesize that the second-stage decision to qualify or not is influenced by factors such as the auditor's risk of litigation, the type (Big Six or not) of auditor, the extent of outsider ownership, the share of public debt in total debt, the relative importance of the client in the auditor's portfolio, and the future growth rate of the client. Our results indicate that the auditor's litigation risk, the extent of outsider ownership, the relative importance of the client in the auditor's portfolio, and future growth are important factors in the audit opinion decision. Estimated mean and median probabilities indicate significantly higher values of reporting probabilities for qualified as compared to unqualified firms, suggesting that the second stage is an important component of the qualification decision. © 1996, SAGE Publications.

      "Abstract: In this study, we examine preferences between lotteries with chances presented either numerically or linguistically. Presentation mode is predicted to affect preferences due to the perception of linguistic chance as skewed distributions of risk. Based upon weighting functions incorporating risk/uncertainty aversion from ambiguity theory and cumulative prospect theory, we predict that presentation mode effects on risky choices will be detectable in very small risks and in large risks. In two experiments, subjects chose between both gain and loss lotteries with constant payoffs and equivalent numeric and linguistic chances. Presentation mode affected choices when chances were above 50%, where lotteries with numeric chances were more frequently preferred in gains while lotteries with linguistic chances were more often preferred in losses. The effect of presentation mode for low-chance lotteries (5% and less) also affected choices such that numeric choices were generally preferred more frequently in losses and linguistically expressed choices were generally preferred more often in gains. Overall, these results suggest that theories of the effects of second order uncertainty on risky choice may be used to model decisions involving linguistic risk. They also suggest that the study of the perception of linguistic risk assessments can provide insight into the cognitive processing behind the weighting functions proposed to depict decision under risk and uncertainty. Finally, the results have practical implications since information providers can affect decision makers' choices by controlling presentation mode in such a way as to alter the relative attractiveness of Uncertain events. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospect theory deviates from expected-utility theory by positing that how people frame a problem around a reference point has a critical influence on their choices and that people tend to overweight losses with respect to comparable gains, to be risk-averse with respect to gains and risk-acceptant with respect to losses, and to respond to probabilities in a non-linear manner. This study examines these and related observed anomalies in expected-utility theory, summarizes how prospect theory integrates these anomalies into an alternative theory of risky choice, and explores some of the implications of prospect theory for international conflict and for bargaining and coercion in particular. One hypothesis is that political leaders of adversarial states behave differently when they are bargaining over gains than when they are bargaining over losses. Another is that crisis behavior may be more destabilizing than commonly predicted by rational choice theories because leaders are less willing to make concessions and more willing to risk large losses in the hope of eliminating small losses altogether.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospect theory, a psychological theory of decision making that has shed new light on foreign policy choices, maintains that people tend to take high risks when facing losses, while proceeding with great caution when anticipating gains. This article introduces prospect theory to the study of comparative politics in order to account for the bold economic policy choices that presidents made in crisis-ridden Argentina, Brazil, and Peru, and the surprising degree of popular support that such risky and costly measures commanded in these countries; and conversely, to explain the cautious course of reform recently pursued in Chile, a country with better economic prospects. Theories based on rational choice, the leading approach to political decision making, did not anticipate these decisions. Particularly, these theories predicted that fear for their political survival would prevent democratic leaders from enacting tough economic policies. This article thus suggests that hypotheses derived from prospect theory serve as a useful alternative to extant rational choice explanations in elucidating decision making during crises.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper had three objectives. (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model. To accomplish the first objective, we use a decision-theoretic model where firms must choose strategies. The true state-of-the-world determines the profit of a strategy. Expertise identifies the true state-of-the-world. The difference in expected profit between decisions made with and without expertise determines the expected value of expertise. Using a decision-theoretic model, we calculated the expected value of marketing expertise. Our theoretical model provided the following three factors influencing the expected value of marketing expertise: (1) the instability of the marketing environment, (2) the profit impact of marketing decisions, and (3) the potential loss from marketing mistakes. An empirical analysis helped accomplish our third objective. We identified some conditions under which marketing expertise is more valuable to a firm. Greater market instability and market presence (for marketing research spending) increase value of marketing expertise, while higher organization instability, larger organization size (for CEO background), and competition decrease the value of marketing expertise. In formulating strategies for new products, market research, promotion, sales force, advertising, and other activities, the firm must first consider the role of marketing in the complete situation of the firm. Webster (1981) and Day and Wind (1980) note that marketing academicians have been preoccupied by tactical decisions rather than investigating important strategic issues. Researchers now realize that a market expertise and a market orientation may not always be best (Kohli and Jaworski 1990, Houston 1986). Identifying when marketing expertise is valuable for a firm has prominent consequences. This study provides a theoretical and empirical model for tacklirig the problem. In sum, this research reinforces the emerging view that the firm and market factors have an influence on the value of marketing expertise. Like other researchers (Kohli and Jaworski 1990, Houston 1986), we argue that marketing expertise may not be the most valuable type of expertise for all firms in all industries. By identifying both theoretically and empirically the conditions under which marketing expertise is more valuable to a firm, we provide a theoretical and empirical model for contrasting the importance of marketing relative to other disciplines.\u001b[0m :\n",

Using scenarios about hypothetical relationships, the results of Study 1 demonstrated that framing objectively identical alternatives in terms of losses versus gains affected participants' preferences for risky versus cautious actions. Furthermore, adult attachment style was found to moderate the impact of this framing effect. Study 2 examined individual differences in people's spontaneous tendencies to frame their feelings about their actual relationships in terms of losses or gains. Consistent with the findings of Study 1, attachment style was reliably associated with spontaneous framing. Secure individuals were most likely to represent their feelings in terms of a \"gains frame\" whereas fearful individuals were most likely to represent their feelings in terms of a loss frame.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Tversky and Kahneman (1991) extended the notions of reference points and gain/loss asymmetry to multiattribute choice tasks having alternatives that cannot be assigned explicit probabilities. Two experiments were designed to test these propositions in the context of choices among job finalists. In the first experiment, undergraduates (N= 82) were provided with attribute information on two job candidates, along with (incomplete) attribute information on a previous job incumbent. The results showed that the relative standing of the job finalists was evaluated from the reference point of the incumbent's performance on the non-missing attributes. Candidates representing the status quo (i.e., no change in performance on the non-missing attributes) were preferred over candidates representing a loss. However, candidates representing a gain were not preferred over candidates representing the status quo. In the second experiment, undergraduates (N = 74) received assessor training and then watched a demonstration of performance in one of two work samples. Participants told that the demonstration was one of excellent performance strongly preferred the status quo candidate (i.e., the one that performed equally well on the demonstration work sample). However, participants told that the example was one of poor performance were indifferent between the status quo and gain candidate. We conclude that the gain/loss asymmetry commonly found in risky choice can also be found in riskless choice tasks such as choosing among job finalists. © 1996 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: 92 young adolescents were tested using Tversky and Kahneman's (1981) decision problems for framing effects. A notable number of young adolescents tested were not influenced by the context of the decision problems, thus they selected the same response option for positively and negatively framed problems. Parallel information was not available in Tversky and Kahneman's study for adults because they used a between-subjects design. However, for present adolescents who selected different response options for different framing problems, the response pattern exhibited by them resembled the general pattern exhibited by the adults tested in Tversky and Kahneman's study - negative frames led them to accept risk to avoid certain loss; positive frames prevented them from risking what they were certain to gain. Boys and girls were similar in their susceptibility to framing effects as were honors students in mathematics as compared to nonhonors students. Although the positive vs negative framing only influenced some of the young adolescents tested in this study, because the influence was consistent, researchers and educators interested in adolescents' decisions involving risky choices might use framing principles to design and assess cognitive interventions for high-risk behaviors among young adolescents.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Because of a higher than normal incidence of pathogenic weight-loss techniques and eating disorders in athletes, 274 coaches were surveyed to discover their attitudes, knowledge, personal experiences, and recommendations regarding weight control. Coaches demonstrated relatively negative attitudes toward and limited knowledge about obesity, with a few gender and ethnic differences. They tended to make decisions about the need for weight control on the basis of appearance rather than objective indicators, and they saw more females as needing to lose weight and more males as needing to gain. Although a majority of the coaches had tried to lose weight themselves, some using dangerous weight-control techniques, they did not recommend such techniques to their athletes. Nevertheless, it is possible that their obvious concern about weight may have been interpreted by their athletes as encouragement for using pathogenic weight-loss methods.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A common scenario in Third World countries is that with the overriding social, economic and political implications being so complex and vast, the actual resolution to urban problems and issues is often lost and the planning process stalls at the problem identification stage. The key to the resolution of the urban decline affecting the central business district of Bombay, Fort, is in accepting and understanding its cultural and architectural significance to the city, its potential to continue as the financial centre with the influx of multinational offices being set up in the city, and to stop the degeneration of a district which already has large-scale formal and informal sector investment. The main argument of the paper is that time is ripe for an innovative conservation strategy. The proposed strategy begins with an action plan that would be essential should a program for conservation be accepted by the city's decision makers. It is a move away from the current piecemeal approach of identifying singular buildings for preservation, and pursues a more holistic approach to protect, regulate and retain the built, economic and social fabric of Fort. Encouraged by the Kanga Commission's initiatives, the proposed approach shows the steps towards a bold but manageable long-term solution. Copyright © 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Kahneman and Tversky (1984) proposed that decision makers perceive choice uncertainty in two ways: (1) as a distribution of possible outcomes or (2) as a single uncertain outcome. Using statistical training as a factor that influences these perceptions, and thus the type of decision approach individuals use, we found that individuals with different levels of experience displayed differences in the decisions they made and in the choice heuristics used to make those decisions. Statistically naive individuals were more likely to prefer loss-minimizing alternatives, use a more non-compensatory heuristic, and spend more time on loss-related information than their statistically experienced counterparts. When a distributional cue, indicating the distributional nature of choice outcomes, was presented to both experience groups, the naive group was found to use a decision approach similar to the experienced group and to make similar decisions. The results are discussed in terms of the need to include factors that alter individuals' approaches to uncertainty in future behavioral models of uncertain choice.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: During the past 10 years, there has been continuing discussion of a central idea of prospect theory: individuals' risk-taking behavior will differ depending on whether they perceive themselves to be in the negative domain (the domain of losses) or the positive domain (the domain of gains). Specifically, prospect theory proposes that individuals will be risk seeking in the negative and risk averse in the positive domain. During this same period, the study of group behavior has continued, and there has been consideration of group factors that may affect risk taking. However, there has been no systematic effort to establish direct linkages between the group behavior and the prospect theory literature. In this article, we begin by reviewing the two literature streams and suggesting linkages. Based on the linkages we see, we propose a series of testable hypotheses that we believe can establish a research agenda for those working in this area. Finally, we propose implications for managers and practitioners.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Theory: In terms of economic voting, voters' perceptions of economic indicators can be more important than the statistics themselves. This distinction is particularly important in understanding George Bush's defeat in 1992. Hypothesis: Relentlessly negative reporting on economic performance during the election year negatively affected voters' perceptions of the economy. These altered perceptions influenced voting behavior. Methods: Ordinary least squares regression is used to demonstrate the media's impact on economic evaluations. Logistic regression is used to demonstrate the importance of economic evaluations in vote choice. Results: Media consumption and attention to the presidential campaign through the mass media negatively shaped voters' retrospective economic assessments. These assessments were significantly related to vote choice. This suggests an explanation for why George Bush lost reelection despite an economy that had rebounded from recession well in advance of election day.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: What was the value in changing ASPA's Code of Ethics? Until recently, the Code of Ethics of the American Society for Public Administration symbolized the confusion in the field rather than its insights. The fine content of the former code was lost in numerous, unequal categories and discursive language. The new code has five principles or decision-making sources upon which public administrators should draw. This article demonstrates how the five sources are prominently discussed in the literature and are useful for practitioners. Even more, the new code should provide an authoritative framework for the field. At an elementary level, the code prohibits egregiously unethical behavior. At a more sophisticated level, the code recognizes that the really tough administrative decisions occur when two or more of the legitimate decision-making sources compete. Thus the code is far more than a list of legalistic prohibitions. It is a powerful tool for decision analysis on the one hand and an aspirational call for excellence in the profession on the other.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Assuming that binary rank- and sign-dependent utility holds for gambles and that riskless choice utility can be constructed using the binary operation of joint receipt of consequences, there are four distinct measures of utility over gains: the two, one from gambles and the other from joint receipt, that arise by working with the trade-offs of just gains and the two that arise by working with the trade-offs of gains with losses. The problem is to discover testable behavioral properties that make the various pairs of measures identical. This is worked out completely, leading to six distinct properties. Three have previously been studied both theoretically and empirically: event commutativity, segregation, and duplex decomposition. Three are new and have not been studied empirically: joint receipt decomposition (for gains and for the mixed case) and joint receipt consistency. Similar issues and results hold for the utility of losses, where the mathematics is identical except for parameter values. The paper concludes with a discussion of how the results extend to general finite gambles and of some possible difficulties. © 1996 Academic Press * This work has been supported in part by National Science Foundation Grant SBR-9540107 to the University of California, Irvine.

      "Abstract: In many organizations point estimates labelled as 'forecasts' are produced by human judgment rather than statistical methods. However, when these estimates are subject to asymmetric loss they are, in fact, decisions because they involve the selection of a value with the objective of minimizing loss. While there are often considerable advantages in using judgment to arrive at these decisions the psychological demands of the task may mean that the resulting decisions are sub-optimal when compared with those resulting from a normative decision model. In these circumstances a combination of statistical methods and judgment may be superior. This paper suggests a procedure which involves the statistical correction of the original decision to obtain a forecast and the subsequent use of a mathematical model to identify the theoretically optimal decision in the light of this forecast. The application of the procedure to the monthly decisions of a manufacturing company suggests that it may offer the potential for achieving substantial improvements in many practical contexts.

      "Abstract: Researchers using prospect theory in explaining Bowman's 1 risk-return paradox have typically assumed a single fixed reference point, normally the industry median, in defining two decision contexts: gain and loss. Our findings suggest this reference point is elevated above industry median performance, and varies over time and across industries independent of industry performance. Consistent with prospect theory, firms above this reference point were risk averse and those below it were risk seeking. We found no evidence of a second survival reference point for firms in trouble.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In comparative judgments that follow binary choices, judgments of \"How much better is a preferred option?\" and \"How much worse is a less preferred option?\" may differ in their magnitudes (\"valence effects\"). This paper analyzed cognitive processes that underlie positive valence effects (\"Better\" exceeding \"Worse\") and negative valence effects (Worse exceeding Better). My analyses used a \"focus shift model.\" The focus shift model postulates that choice options are represented as sets of desirable and undesirable features. Difference judgments are reached by assigning subjective weights onto such features and integrating weighted feature contributions. Positive and negative valence effects reflect the differences in subjective weighting depending on valence of judgments. Experiments 1 through 3 showed that systematic positive valence effects were observed in the domain of gains, whereas negative valence effects were observed in the domain of losses. Estimates of subjective weights showed that valence effects occurred when participants heavily weighted desirable features in preferred options and undesirable features in less preferred options. These patterns of subjective weighting for positive and negative valence effects were consistent with the focus shift model. Data were more consistent with the focus shift model over alternative explanations of valence effects. Relationship with relevant economic and psychological phenomena are discussed. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Based on the value-expectancy framework of migration decisionmaking, an explanatory model is tested which includes migration-related value measures along with individual, household and community-level determinants of both intentions to move and change in intentions to move. Multinomial logistic regression results based on data from the 1992 Thailand National Migration Survey provide some support for the hypothesis of gender-specific determinants of both intentions to move and the reconsideration of migration intentions. For men, value measures of affiliation and comfort, social networks, the presence of young children in the family, and land holdings are significant determinants of migration decisionmaking; for women income and comfort values, the presence of elderly persons in the household, community size, and crop losses are the salient factors. The results are discussed in light of traditional and current cultural expectations for men and women in rural Thailand.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decison-making dilemmas can arise because errors may result either from deciding too soon or from delaying decisions too long. Delay can result in lost opportunities or reductions in payoffs from the most accurate decision. This paper investigates decision processes in environments where there is time stress due to the opportunity cost of delaying decisions. First, using computer simulation, the relative accuracy of alternative decision strategies is examined in environments that differ in terms of the levels of opportunity cost of delay. The lexicographic choice rule is shown to be a very attractive decision process in situations where there is opportunity-cost time pressure. Two experiments test the adaptivity of actual decision behavior to the presence or absence of opportunity-cost time pressure along with variations in goals (accuracy emphasized vs. effort savings emphasized), dispersion in probabilities or weights across the outcomes of the choice options, and the degree of correlation among the outcomes. Subjects were generally adaptive to opportunity-cost time pressure. However, failures in adaptivity were identified when choice environment properties with conflicting implications for adaptation were present simultaneously. In particular, under opportunity-cost time pressure, subjects received a lower expected payoff when the goal was to emphasize choice accuracy than when the goal was to emphasize savings in effort. The question of when adaptivity in decision making might fail is discussed, © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Health care professionals need to know what meanings women with breast cancer are ascribing to their disease if they are to identify maladaptive coping strategies and ensure that women receive the support that they need in order to promote physical and psychological recovery. This study involved assessing meaning of illness for a group of women with breast cancer at two points in time, the time of diagnosis and a mean of 21 months from diagnosis. The eight meanings of illness devised by Lipowski were depicted by the following words: challenge, enemy, punishment, loss, strategy, relief, weakness and value. The most popular choice of meaning for the women was challenge, although some women's choices indicated that maladaptive coping strategies were being used.

Ectopic pregnancy is a risk factor associated with fertility management, but unlike early miscarriage in fertility management, an ectopic pregnancy has additional potential negative sequelae for the women, including risk for severe hemorrhage and death and threat to future fertility. The purpose of this study was to describe women's experiences of loss following diagnosis and treatment of an ectopic pregnancy while undergoing fertility management. A thematic analysis of the data derived from semistructured interviews was conducted. Themes emerging from the women's discussion of their pregnancy loss and fertility plans included physical pain and shutdown, emotional protection, grief, and pressure, endpoints, and decision making. For women continuing fertility management, both the life-threatening risks of future ectopics and time allowances for grieving were minimized.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In decisions involving choice under strict uncertainty, decision makers' choice heuristics varied widely depending on the task conditions. Two experimental task variables, the format of the outcome distribution and the presence or absence of a time constraint, were used to test the sensitivity of choice processes and choice preferences in these decisions. With no time constraint, decision makers made compensatory tradeoffs on the displayed information when the distribution of outcomes was presented as a range, but they used a loss minimization heuristic when the distribution was presented as variability around the range midpoint. With a time constraint, decision makers used a loss minimization heuristic when exposed to the range format presentation of outcomes, whereas in the midpoint format, they focused on the midpoint outcome. Choice preferences also shifted with changes in time constraint. With no time constraint, decision makers preferred high variability alternatives when outcomes were presented in range format, but low variability alternatives in midpoint format presentation. With a time constraint these preferences reversed. Decision makers seemed to adapt their choice processing to the decision conditions rather than using some canonical choice rule regardless of the conditions. This result is consistent with the findings of previous studies that looked at risky choice and risk-free choice. The implication is that although people may have intuitive models of choice under strict uncertainty such as loss minimization, the stronger factor in determining how they make their decisions seems to be the actual task conditions of the decision, © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Preference for different increasing (or decreasing) sequences of rewards has been found to depend both on the magnitude of increase or decrease from step-to-step in the sequence and on the rate of change with which rewards increase or decrease. This experiment examined the effects on preference of different magnitudes and rates of change of reward. Using rewards for actual task performance, four increasing and four decreasing sequences were studied, each consisting of 24 rewards of varying magnitude. Sequences differed according to four possible models of rate change: linear, exponential, logarithmic, and step function. Preferences for given reward sequences obtained prior to extensive task and reward experience (decision utility) were not closely related to preferences after such experience (predicted utility). In the increasing reward sequences, subjects preferred the step sequence (with its single large increase at the end) prior to experience, but after experience they preferred the exponential, linear, and logarithmic sequences which entailed continuous reward-to-reward improvement throughout the sequence. In the decreasing sequences, subjects were less definite in their preferences. Prior to experience they most preferred the logarithmic sequence with its decelerating decline in magnitude of rewards, while after experience they least preferred the step function, with its huge loss at the end of the sequence. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Two experiments examined the influence of positive affect on probability estimation and choice. Participants in whom positive affect had been induced, as well as no-manipulation controls, were asked to make both numerical evaluations of verbal probabilities in three-outcome gambles and actual betting decisions about similar gambles. Results from Experiment 1 showed the phenomenon labeled cautious optimism: Positive affect participants significantly overestimated the probabilities associated with phrases for winning relative to their estimates of probability of losing for the same phrases (optimism), while participants in a control condition did not; yet, in actual gambling situations, affect condition participants were much less likely to gamble than were controls when a real loss was possible (caution). Results of the betting task from Experiment 2 further indicated that affect participants used a betting-decision rule that was different from that of controls: They bet less than controls in gambles where potential losses were large, even though probability of loss was small, and they bet more than controls in gambles where the amount of the potential loss was small, even though the probability of loss was moderate or large. These findings suggest that positive affect can promote an overt shift from a decision rule focusing primarily on probabilities to one focusing on utilities or outcome values, especially for losses. Taken together, the results are compatible with an interpretation of the influence of positive affect in terms of an elaboration of positive cognitive material, and purposive behavior in decisions, rather than in terms of mere response bias. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Two experiments assess the type and amount of conflict influencing decision difficulty in hypothetical scenarios where subjects chose between two alternatives made to appear relatively attractive (approach-approach conflicts) or relatively unattractive (avoidance-avoidance conflicts), each involving attribute trade-offs across alternatives (embedded approach-avoidance conflicts). In Experiment 1, independent of information processing demands, decisions are more difficult when alternatives are unattractive and/or attribute trade-offs are large. Reference states that change the relative attractiveness of the alternatives increase or decrease decision difficulty in a manner consistent with loss aversion: Superior reference states increase decision difficulty more than inferior reference states reduce it. Experiment 2 further tests the reference dependence of decision difficulty by varying the nature of the reference state (stated comparators, as in Experiment 1, or endowments) as well as its extremity. Endowed reference states affect decision difficulty more than reference states that are stated comparators. Moreover, consistent with loss aversion, inferior reference states that are twice as extreme as superior reference states reduce decision difficulty about as much as the superior reference states increase it. The results demonstrate that decisions can be made easier or harder by way of reference dependence, and that the loss aversion so prevalent in preference formation generalizes to perceptions of decision difficulty in multiattribute settings. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this paper, we claim that great importance should also be given to the fact that the incumbent firm is in the industry while the entrant is outside the industry. Therefore, even without any other asymmetries, we should expect different behavior from the two types of firms. Making use of the existing literature on decision making under uncertainty, the paper focuses on reference-dependent preferences and on loss aversion. The paper demonstrates that the firms' reference points and loss aversion affect a firm's entry/exit decision, the self-selection of entrants, and the market structure that emerges.\u001b[0m :\n",

In responding to traditional framing problems, problems posing explicit threats), subjects faced with gain prospects have generally been thought to presuppose losses or shift their reference point downward. Abelson and Levi have suggested that, similarly, subjects might be expected to presuppose gains or shift their reference point upward when faced with problems that pose explicit opportunities. Choices in this study were consistent with this prediction. However, measures aimed at assessing the interpretations of framing problems did not support the presumed shifts in reference point. Moreover, evidence was found for a problem domain effect on overall risk seeking in one problem arena (jobs), but no such effect was found in another problem arena (money).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: A series of studies examined how various blood ethanol concentrations influenced the effectiveness of a negative punishment procedure in a risk-taking/decision-making task. Based on the animal punishment literature plus the impression that ethanol diminishes the effects of punishment and impairs decision making, it was predicted that individuals receiving alcohol would increase their risk-taking behavior despite the presence of a negative punishment stimulus (point loss) given on a variable schedule. Method: In Experiment 1, a within-subjects design with repeated measures was used where 10 male subjects played a modified computer-generated choice game under three levels of punishment certainty. Three levels of punishment severity and four ranges of blood ethanol (0.00%. 0.01-0.049%, 0.050-0.099%, 0.10-0.15%). Results: Results indicated significant decreases in risk taking as either punishment certainty or severity was increased. However, no significant effects were found for ethanol, or interactions of ethanol with punishment certainly or punishment severity. Two additional studies examining aspects of the experimental procedure produced similar results. Conclusions: Overall, the results of these studies do not support the hypothesis that high concentrations of blood alcohol are sufficient in and of themselves to eliminate the suppression function of negative punishment contingencies leading to increased risk-taking behavior. The implications of these results for understanding blood alcohol effects are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research has considered the question of how anticipated regret affects risky decision making. Several studies have shown that anticipated regret forces participants towards the safe option, showing risk-aversion. We argue that these results are due to the previous confounding of the riskiness of the options with the feedback received. Our design unconfounds these factors, and we predict that participants will always tend to make regret-minimizing choices (rather than risk-minimizing choices). We present three experiments using a \"choices between equally valued alternatives\" paradigm. In these experiments we manipulate whether the risky or safe gamble is the regret-minimizing choice by manipulating which gamble(s) will be resolved. As predicted, participants tend to choose the regret-minimizing gamble in both gains and losses and in both relatively high risk and relatively low risk pairs of gambles. We consider the implications of these results for the role of regret in Choice behavior. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People prefer a sure gain to a probable larger gain when the two choices are presented from a gain perspective, but a probable larger loss to a sure loss when the objectively identical choices are presented from a loss perspective. Such reversals of preference due to the context of the problem are known as framing effects. In the present study, schema activation and subjects' interpretations of the problems were examined as sources of the framing effects. Results showed that such effects could be eliminated by introducing into a problem a causal schema that provided a rationale for the reciprocal relationship between the gains and the losses. Moreover, when subjects were freed from framing they were consistently risk seeking in decisions about human life, but risk averse in decisions about property. Irrationally in choice behaviors and the ecological implication of framing effects are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Several organizational researchers have recently argued that the propositions of Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) prospect theory are in conflict with commonly held notions of risk taking for opportunities and risk aversion for threats. This investigation was an attempt to empirically separate threat and opportunity perceptions from loss and gain perspectives. Experiment 1 (N = 244) revealed that most decision makers, faced with a traditional framing problem, perceived the risky alternative as an opportunity when they were in the loss domain, but perceived it as a threat when they were in the gain domain. Experiment 2 showed that framing the same (loss and gain) problems as threats versus opportunities influenced risk taking, such that management students (N = 84) were more risk taking for opportunity-framed problems and risk averse for threat-framed problems. At the same time, the students took more risks for the loss problem than for the gain problem. We conclude that threat and opportunity perceptions are theoretically and empirically distinguishable from loss and gain perspectives. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This prospective study aimed to investigate the impact of both (the speediness of) a subsequent pregnancy and the birth of a viable child on grief arising from a previous pregnancy loss. Data were collected from a series of written questionnaires. Of the 2140 pregnant women who participated in the study, 227 lost a baby by miscarriage (85%) or perinatal death (15%). In 221 women, the loss concerned a singleton. At each of four post-loss assessments, these women completed the Perinatal Grief Scale. They also indicated whether they had conceived again and, if they had, related how they felt about that. Data were analyzed by means of hierarchical multiple regression. Both conceiving again and the birth of a living child lessened grief: A speedy new pregnancy was only rarely found to be detrimental. It is suggested that parents, at least following miscarriage, no longer be advised to wait a specific time before conceiving again. Preferably their individual situation should be discussed with them in order to help them make their own informed decision concerning the subsequent pregnancy.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Drawing on the accounts given by 163 relatives, friends and others who knew a sample of people who lived alone in the last twelve months of their lives, this paper examines a variety of strategies used by speakers to maintain their moral identities. Respondents sought to locate themselves as members of a community of care by stressing their activity in surveillance of the living conditions of those who lived alone, describing their part in the orchestration of help by members of a team of professional and lay carers, and in conducting negotiations over the placement in institutions of people who failed to maintain adequate reputations for independent living. A variety of strategies for justifying or excusing placement decisions - including criticisms of the behaviour of the people who lived alone - are described. At the same time, the accounts are read as a resource for understanding the perspective of the people who lived alone. People who live alone towards the end of life face particularly pressing threats to their capacity to maintain meaning and purpose. Declining physical capacity threatens loss of control and the onset of social death, conspiring to undermine ontological security. The struggle to maintain a reputation for independence in the face of neighbourly surveillance for signs of slippage is described. The paper concludes by identifying a central dilemma for carers: how to provide care that allows its recipient to manage self-identity independently.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Effects on intrinsic motivation of three elements of the competitive situation (viz., competitive set, competitive outcome, and interpersonal context) were explored. Participants solved puzzles with a same-sex confederate under one of five experimental inductions, and intrinsic motivation was assessed by subsequent free-choice behavior and self-reports of interest/enjoyment. As predicted by cognitive evaluation theory, competitive outcome (viz., winning vs. losing) and interpersonal context (viz., pressured vs. nonpressured) affected intrinsic motivation. Path analyses showed that (a) winning (relative to losing) increased intrinsic motivation by enhancing perceived competence and (b) a pressured (relative to nonpressured) interpersonal context decreased intrinsic motivation by diminishing perceived self-determination. Further, competence valuation - the importance one places on doing well - related positively to perceived competence, perceived self-determination, and intrinsic motivation.\u001b[0m :\n",

This paper suggests three dimensions on which information processing for resource allocations differs: status quo effects (individuals react more strongly to losses in status quo than to gains), resource valence effects (individuals react more strongly to resource allocations involving burdens than those involving benefits), and blame effects (individuals react more strongly to resource allocation decisions in which they exercise choice). Results of an empirical study confirm significant differences in the information processing of burdens and benefits, and also confirm the importance of psychological distance in the reactions of individuals to burdens and benefits allocations. © 1996 Plenum Publishing Corporation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An alternative theoretical explanation of integration of prior outcomes in risky decisions is the loss-sensitivity principle stating that a prior outcome is only added to expected losses. An experiment is reported which tested the implication of this principle that there will be less integration with an expected loss when its salience is reduced. A group of 20 undergraduates rated how likely they were to make imaginary roulette bets with less salient expected losses whereas another group with an equal number of undergraduates performed the same type of ratings for imaginary horse-race bets with more salient expected losses. In support of the implication, a prior outcome had a stronger impact in the latter group. A stronger impact was furthermore found for high as compared to low stakes. When the loss was salient, the impact of the prior outcome was greater for subjects who reported that they were in a positive mood than for subjects who reported that they were in a more neutral mood.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The attraction effect has historically referred to a situation in which an inferior alternative (i.e., a decoy) influences the relative attractiveness of other alternatives in a choice set. This investigation was aimed at examining attraction effects in a simulated employee-selection context, and testing alternative hypotheses for the source of attraction effects. Experiment 1 investigated decoys along with superior, but unavailable, (i.e., phantom) alternatives in an employee-selection scenario. Results showed no target by alternative-type interaction, suggesting that decoys and phantoms operate similarly in affecting selection. This finding favors context-dependent weighting and loss-aversion explanations for attraction effects.

      "Abstract: Post-decision consolidation processes were studied in a two-stage lottery design. School children (1) rated the attractiveness of audiotape head sets, (2) decided for which of two head sets they would like to get a lottery ticket, (3) threw a dice to determine if they got a lottery ticket in the preferred lottery or not, and (4) drew a ticket in the final lottery. Before and after each of these stages ratings were obtained of the attractiveness of the alternatives on four attributes. The results were interpreted in terms of Differentiation and Consolidation Theory. Post-decision consolidation appeared immediately after the outcome of the dice throw. Subjects who won a lottery ticket consolidated their prior decision to a greater degree than those who lost. The effect was so strong for the former group that a pre-decision attractiveness disadvantage was restructured to a post-decision advantage. Folowing the decision, consolidation remained at approximately the level reached immediately after the dice throw for losers and winners, respectively, but with an increasing trend over time for winners. Even following a final loss of an audiotape headset the level of consolidation was maintained.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We use computer simulations to show how social fragmentation and consequent social loss can result from six innocuous cognitive and behavioral assumptions. These assumptions govern individuals' choices with respect to each other and are independent of processes associated with fragmentation in various classical literatures. We model \"society\" as a set of individuals who encounter each other in circumstances that permit potentially productive but also risky relationships with each other. Individuals (1) have the option of playing Prisoner's Dilemma games with others they encounter, but they do not have to; (2) have preferences over mutual cooperation and free-riding outcomes; (3) have expectations about each other's play; (4) have observable cateogry \"tags\"; (5) can modify their future responses to \"tagged\" individuals based on experience; (6) can search out partners they believe represent good prospects for productive relationships. In these terms, the only condition necessary for fragmentation to emerge is that some circumstance makes the probability of encounters across \"tagged\" categories unequal, and a difference in sizes of categories, however slight, is sufficient to do that. Some difference in category sizes is, for practical purposes, inevitable, and thus so are pressures toward fragmentation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In six studies, student subjects were given short descriptions of persons experiencing the same degree of success under different circumstances, and asked to decide in each case who is most lucky (in the case of success), and who is most unlucky (in the case of failure). Typically, the most 'lucky' person is the winner who most easily could, or should, have lost, and the most 'unlucky' is the loser who could, or should, have won. Factors contributing to counterfactual closeness, and thus to the experience of luck, are: Physical closeness, temporal order, choice, how \"real\" is the alternative, and how much is it deserved. By manipulating such factors, a vignette describing two misfortunes can appear lucky (because they move the victim away from close counterfactual success); and a vignette where one out of two lottery players wins a big prize can be construed as an example of bad rather than good luck (if the other deserved to win).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A reversal of preference between compound and simple risks was demonstrated in the context of compound gambles with loss elements transparently in common. The role of predecision editing heuristics in this violation of the Invariance Principle was explored in a process-tracing study. Verbal reports showed that cancellation-by-similarity and amalgamation heuristics were differentially applied to simple and compound risks depending on their similarity structure. It was argued that such heuristics are often useful in simplifying complex choice problems without loss of important information. However, the inappropriate cancellation of elements of compound risks can be maladaptive, and can contribute to a lack of insight into the true nature of these risks. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper has three objectives: (1) to construct a theoretical model that aids in evaluating marketing expertise, (2) to use that theoretical model to identify factors influencing the value of marketing expertise, and (3) to empirically test the model by observing how different market conditions influence whether companies emphasize marketing expertise. We accomplish these objectives as follows. First, we use decision theory to find an expression for the expected value of marketing expertise. We do not use decision-analysis in the normative tradition. Nor do we assume that firms actually use formal decision-analysis. Rather, we assume that firms are rational and that decision theory describes their actions. Given that assumption, we predict how firms should evaluate marketing. Here, marketing expertise helps a firm make better marketing decisions (at least on average). Hence, the value of marketing expertise increases as marketing decisions become more important. Second, consistent with decision theory, we predict that marketing decisions become more important with increases in the instability of the marketing environment (i.e., predictability), the profit impact of marketing decisions (i.e., opportunity profit), and the loss from marketing mistakes (i.e., potential loss). Third, we construct empirical measures of our theoretical constructs with data from 592 firms. Our empirical results are consistent with our predictions and reveal factors influencing the value of marketing expertise. For example, greater market instability and market presence increase the value of marketing expertise, while larger organization size, organization instability, and competition decrease its value.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Older workers are often placed in an unenviable position in the face of stereotypes which define them as increasingly marginal in the work force, and view retirement in terms of status loss and disengagement. Yet voluntary early retirement schemes have been a recent feature of work organisations of all types in Britain, Western Europe and North America. The nature of the decision-making processes of those involved in such schemes has not been widely researched and such studies as have been conducted have not drawn on the existing framework of decision analysis. This paper reports the findings of two linked studies into the early retirement decisions of men working in Britain for a large multinational company in the manufacturing sector. The first investigated the factors deemed to be important for a group of men at the point of decision whilst the second investigated both the factors deemed to be important and the quality of life of a group of men who had taken the decision to retire early between 18 months and 3 years previously. Both studies indicated that the decisionmaking process is complex and cannot be reduced to single-factors like health or financial status. The most important factor in the quality of life of early retirees was the matching of expectations of further work at the point of decision. The studies illustrated the utility of a decision analysis approach to the study of early retirement.\u001b[0m :\n",

Charging a fee to play (which makes initial equilibria money-losing) creates coordination on better equilibria. When fees are optional, improved coordination is consistent with forward induction. But coordination improves even when subjects must pay the fee (forward induction does not apply).

The community and the types of gambling available are described. Data on gambling expenditures were obtained from various state agencies. Lottery and casino winners were interviewed to discover how their winnings were distributed. Annual (1991) player losses, profit margins, taxes, and resulting economic and social impacts are discussed. The most consequential findings are estimates of annual player losses ($3.3 million; $205 per capita) and community revenue losses ($2.2 million; $138 per capita). Per capita lottery and charitable gambling player losses were 9.4% lower than those of a community studied earlier; per capita community revenue losses were 7.6% lower. Research methods developed in this study provided more reliable estimates than those used previously.

      "Abstract: We consider the implication, for study efficiency, of choice of method of exposure assessment in epidemiological studies, and in particular the optimal allocation of resources that should be devoted to improving the accuracy of exposure assessments. Useful for this purpose is a general result that the efficiency of a study based on approximate exposures relative to one based on exact exposures is equal to the square of the correlation between the true exposure and the approximate measurement in the study base (called the validity coefficient). This implies that to maximize study power, investment in increased precision is worthwhile up to the point at which proportional increase in total costs per subject exceed the proportional gain in the square of the validity coefficient. This result does not hold if exposure measurement error depends on disease status (is differential), or if important confounders are measured with error. 'Classical' exposure measurement error (uncorrelated with true exposure) or misclassification usually biases estimates of effect. Information from validity or reliability sub-studies can be used to correct this bias, but not substantially recover lost efficiency. There are several papers on the optimal allocation of resources to a validity sub-study. © 1995.\u001b[0m :\n",

Subjects preferred the store that guaranteed (a \"sure\" option) good prices (experiment 1), product availability (experiment 2), or a rebate (experiment 3) when consequences were framed in terms of gains; subjects preferred the risky option when consequences were framed in terms of losses. Consistent with fuzzy-trace theory, framing effects were reduced when the expected values of options were disparate in a direction that disfavored sure gain or probabilistic loss options (experiment 2) and when the perceived costs of committing a judgmental error were high (experiment 3).

      "Abstract: Biases in risk perception potentially have a large effect on insurance and risk-related behavior. The government can alter these perceptions either through informational programs or controlling the risk. Policies that convey a higher risk level generally have the expected effects on insurance and protective actions, whereas efforts that increase the precision of either the government risk information or private beliefs typically have ambiguous effects. In some cases, the structure of how government policies enter the risk-belief function is consequential. Ascertaining the magnitude of the effects, not simply the direction, also is an important issue. For example, misperceptions have a dramatic effect on the tradeoffs between compensating differentials and the size of the loss but a negligible effect on the tradeoff between compensating differentials and the magnitude of the probability. © 1995 The Geneva Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

Accordingly, two or more decision situations can be valued to determine where scarce infor Mation resources are best deployed. It is shown how minimum and maximum EVPI can be determined for a given payoff matrix as a game against nature. The infor Mation gains (or losses) in dollar or percentage terms can also be determined as the decision maker moves through various infor Mation stages such as null, vague and proper prior distributions.

      "Abstract: Morales and colleagues deserve credit for extending traditional economic analysis by using anthropological field data and applying midlevel economic tools to policy analysis. However, their analysis is problematic because it exaggerates how many benefits would be lost if the Maxwell Street Market were moved, ignores the costs imposed by the market, and does not consider the economic benefits of the university's proposed land use. Even very moderate success of the university's plans will more than compensate for the economic losses caused by the market's move. It was politically impossible for the university to implement its expansion plans while maintaining the market. Such difficult choices inevitably arise in a complex urban environment. Cost-benefit analysis is a useful tool, but provides only some of the information that enters into the decision-making process.

Outside investors have an incentive to seek compensation via tort law and the Securities Act of 1933 should the stock price fall subsequent to their purchase of the IPO. Potential litigation costs motivate the entrepreneur to underprice the IPO in a tradeoff between the litigation cost and the up‐front opportunity loss of underpricing.

The degree to which virgins predicted they would feel better afterfirst experiencing sex was significantly less than that which nonvirgins reported actually feeling.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 52-Foreign Currency Translation (SFAS 52) was issued in December 1981, but its application to U.S. companies was not mandatory until fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1982. Therefore, multinational calendar-year companies could manage earnings by deciding whether to apply SFAS 8 or SFAS 52 for the years 1981 and 1982. The study found that firms adopting SFAS 52 early were less capital intensive, smaller, had lower debt-to-equity ratios, and had larger foreign currency translation amounts that were losses: this provides evidence of earnings management.

We find that in the case of Somalia, news coverage trends do not support the claim that news attention to Somalia led to the Bush administration’s decision to intervene. On the basis of content analysis and interviews of officials in Washington and Africa, we argue that the decision to intervene was the result of diplomatic and bureaucratic operations, with news coverage coming in response to those decisions. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In spite of its importance to the retail sector, there has been relatively little research on the economics of Christmas Season gift-giving. The one exception is Waldfogel (1993), The Deadweight loss of Christmas, American Economic Review, 83, 1328-1336, who found a substantial amount of deadweight loss associated with Christmas gift-giving. Here it is shown that the Waldfogel study is incomplete and alternative models of consumer choice theory which better explain Christmas gift-giving are identified. Although the standard neoclassical and altruistic models predict no relationship between the population of children and per capita Christmas spending, a model is developed that includes non-pecuniary externalities and predicts that children have a positive impact on Christmas gift-giving. This prediction is supported by empirical evidence. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent findings of large differences between people's valuations of gains and losses imply that the common preference order axioms of completeness, transitivity, and dominance, on which economic analyses and predictions of consumer behavior are largely based, may not be consistent with actual choices. This paper reports the results of an experimental test of the preference order assumptions using real exchanges of two goods and money. The findings show consistent differences in the valuation placed on goods and money depending on whether the entitlements are being acquired or given up, and provide direct evidence of preference assumption violations.

      "Abstract: This article argues that the devaluation of options with missing information, found in previous research, is a specific example of ambiguity avoidance in choice. H. J. Einhorn and R. M. Hogarth's (1985) ambiguity model was used to make predictions concerning responses to missing information in an employee-selection context. A within-subjects design was used to test the hypothesis that decision makers would avoid options with missing information when they were anticipating gain, but they would prefer such options when they were anticipating loss. Degree of ambiguity was expected to interact with this effect. The results supported the hypothesized effect of decision-maker perspective on choice. However, although there was a significant interaction between decision-maker perspective and degree of ambiguity, it was not of the nature that was predicted by the Einhorn-Hogarth model. Generalized pessimism was negatively correlated with preferences for missing-information options. © 1995 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Probabilities are the integral components of utility. In a risk venture, people are not only cognizant of the financial gains and losses attached to the venture, but are also aware of the probabilities attached to the losses and gains. For most people, losses have greater negative consequences than he positive consequences of equivalent gains. This is risk aversion. Most people are risk averse, but the degree to which people are risk averse varies greatly. College students, with their limited resources, typically are much more risk averse than are venture capitalists. Some people are actually risk seeking rather than risk averse in their outlook—at least over a range. Because different individuals have different attitudes toward risk, a series of utility functions ranging from strongly risk averse can be envisioned through risk neutral to risk seeking. A risk-neutral outlook is identical to a pure expected monetary value (EMV) criterion, where a financial loss is identical to a gain of an equal amount of money in its psychological effect, except that a loss has negative consequences and a gain has positive consequences, regardless of the amount of money at stake. Many individuals and companies exhibit aberrant behavior toward risk. Some may be risk seeking when lesser amounts of money are involved but become strongly risk averse when larger amounts are at stake. Most people who gamble at casinos are risk seeking over only a limited range. One way to determine utility is to analyze decisions that have been made in the past. Another way is to obtain responses to a series of hypothetical investment alternatives in which losses and gains and attached probabilities are specified for alternative outcomes, which assume that the responses exemplify those that would be obtained in actual situations. Sometimes the responses are so erratic that it is difficult to graph them. © 1995, Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The quantity of “horse-race” coverage of political campaigns has been amply documented, but its consequences for the dynamics of campaigns are less well understood. This study examines the effects of media portrayals of public support for candidates on the behavior of potential campaign contributors. This relationship is tested in the context of the four leading Democratic presidential primary candidates in 1988. A time-series analysis of contributor behavior suggests that horse-race spin—that is, the extent of media coverage suggesting a candidate is gaining or losing political support—helps determine the frequency of campaign contributions. Consistent with previous research, some contributors are motivated to donate by coverage suggesting that their strongly favored candidate is losing ground, while other candidacies benefit from coverage suggesting increased viability. Overall, findings suggest that strategic considerations weigh heavily in decisions to donate money to political candidates. © 1995, Southern Political Science Association.

      "Abstract: Attempts to solve the Trolley Problem by means of a single principle have proved unpersuasive. Nor can the intuition about Transplant be adequately grounded in the hypothetical dissent of rational contractors. It is explained by the initial liability principle, that loss should lie where it falls unless there is sufficient reason to shift it. If we did not think we should accept misfortune in such cases and thought that minimising loss of life was sufficient reason to shift the loss we should not be according others the minimum respect and treatment we feel is their due. The intuition about Trolley is explained by the affinity of that case to the pure case where the choice is between saving many and saving fewer, where minimising misfortune is the only credible option. But these considerations are not yet enough to accommodate the cases that lie between the extremes of Trolley and Transplant. We can handle the intermediate cases by attempting to assimilate them to one or other paradigm and to one another with a sensitivity to morally relevant and irrelevant differences that seeks initially to be faithful to the values reflected by our moral intuitions. Those intuitive judgements are unlikely to survive such an examination wholly unmodified. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

We examine whether the perceived fairness of layoff procedures, corporate and government assistance programs, and individual differences influence the choice of problem-focused and/or symptom-focused coping strategies. Our findings challenge traditionally held assumptions about factors that may be associated with successful coping. Specifically, perceptions of the fairness of layoff procedures and adequacy of government assistance programs were negatively related with problem-focused strategies used by layoff victims, and there was no relationship with corporate assistance programs and the choice of coping strategy. In addition, self-blame for the job loss was positively related to a symptom-focused strategy. Suggestions for future research on victims of layoffs are discussed. © 1995, Sage Publications.

The individual's choice to cooperate or not was determined by 1 of 3 simple heuristics: tit-for-tat; win-stay, lose-change; or win-cooperate, lose-defect. Wins and losses were determined through the comparison of a play's outcome with the average outcome of the individual's neighbors. The results revealed qualitative differences between small and large groups. Furthermore, the prevalence of cooperation in the population depended in predictable ways on the heuristic used, the values of the payoff matrix, and the details of the social comparison process that framed the outcomes as wins or losses.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We propose three principles and a general framework of reasoning for managing risk in the public interest.Principle 1.Risks shall be managed to maximize the total expected net benefit to society— The principle that the net benefit is to be maximized across society as a whole is argued to be a sufficient and rational guide to assessing the effectiveness of efforts directed at reducing risk and thus improving health and safety. The net benefit of an activity is the excess of the totality of benefits over the totality of detriments.Principle 2.The safety benefit to be promoted is life‐expectancy— The goal is to ensure that risk mitigation efforts maximize the net benefit to society in the specific terms of length of life for all individuals. The effect of an activity on life expectancy is proposed as the proper basic measure of its net safety impact. Life expectancy is a universal measure valid for comparisons both within and among countries and can be adjusted to include health expectancy and other factors such as income levels that affect the quality of life. The impact on life expectancy allows a dispassionate accounting of the good and the bad inherent in any proposal or activity that is in the public interest but has some impact on life and health. Principle 3.Decisions for the public in regard to health and safety must be open and apply across the complete range of hazards to life and health— Systematic efforts to evaluate all the important consequences, both direct and indirect, are required to improve the basis for risk management in society. Balancing of the detriments and the benefits of any given initiative is the key aspect of the undertaking. Safety may well be an important objective in society, but it is not the only one. Thus, allocation of society's resources devoted to safety must be openly and continually appraised in light of other competing social needs because there is a limit on the resources that can be expended to save lives. Maximization of healthful life for all is judged the proper basis for managing risk in the public interest, and that this is achieved when the net of the contribution to the total saving of life exceeds the loss of life.

      "Abstract: Resource-allocation behavior has recently received increasing attention in the decision-theory literature partially because individuals and societies are facing hard decisions about the allocation of constrained resources. We observed in two previous studies that resource allocators do not plan for probable losses in loss situations, but instead react to losses after they occur. In this paper, we determine if a similar failure to anticipate changes in resources occurs in a gain situation. The data suggest that subjects do not allocate their resources in anticipation of probable gains or losses, thus considerably increasing the generality of our previous findings. © 1995 Academic Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: My study compares the effects of three different types of CPA firm services-audits, reviews, and compilations-on the extent to which two types of accounting irregularities might occur. Using the randomized response technique, an experiment was performed where experienced MBA and Executive MBA students were asked to make decisions involving inappropriate ways to inflate income. One decision (situation #1) was whether or not to recognize a loss from a write-down of defective inventories, as would be necessary according to generally accepted accounting principles. The other decision (situation #2) was whether or not to alter the date on a shipping document so that income could be recognized in the current year instead of in the following year. For both decisions, differences in the expected direction were found among the responses from subjects in the audit, review, and compilation groups. However, only the results for situation #1 were statistically significant. In addition, subjects' perceptions about the levels of assurance provided by the three CPA firm services were similar across these services. © 1995.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In its most basic form, bandit theory is concerned with the design problem of sequentially choosing members from a given collection of random variables so that the regret, i.e., [Formula Omitted], grows as slowly as possible with increasing n. Here µj is the expected value of the bandit arm (i.e., random variable) Indexed by j, Tn(j) is the number of times arm j has been selected in the first n decision stages, and [Formula Omitted]. The present paper contributes to the theory by considering the situation in which observations are dependent. To begin with, the dependency is presumed to depend only on past observations of the same arm, but later, we allow that it may be with respect to the entire past and that the set of arms is infinite. This brings queues and, more generally, controlled Markov processes into our purview. Thus our “black-box” methodology is suitable for the case when the only observables are cost values and, in particular, the probability structure and loss function are unknown to the designer The conclusion the analysis is that under lenient conditions, using algorithms prescribed herein, risk growth is commensurate with that in the simplest i.i.d. cases. Our methods represent an alternative to recent stochastic-approximation/perturbation-analysis ideas for tuning queues. © 1995 IEEE\u001b[0m :\n",

Experiment 1 showed that, by repeating the event, these tendencies could be substantially reduced, but not eliminated, when expected value was held constant between the sure alternative and the risky one. Experiment 2 demonstrated that risk-aversion can be reversed to risk-seeking within the gain situation, and vice versa within the loss situation, by changing the probabilities and the payoffs associated with the probabilities.

      "Abstract: We investigated infertile couples with grand multiple pregnancies who elected multifetal pregnancy reduction (FR) or declined the procedure in order to understand the psychological sequelae of this decision. A unique questionnaire was designed to evaluate the various psychological issues in FR and in parenting multiples. The FR group (n = 31) and a declination (DR) group (n = 13) who conceived a grand multiple pregnancy but declined fetal reduction were investigated by mail with appropriate coding of the questionnaires to maintain confidentiality. All patients conceived following assisted reproduction and there were no differences between the groups with regard to maternal age, race, education, marital status, or median family income. Seventy-one percent of the FR group were employed outside the home whereas only 30% of DR women were similarly employed. Religious beliefs played an important role in the DR group; the FR group reported financial concerns as being an important factor in the decision process. Nearly one-third of FR patients considered themselves to be uncomfortable or very uncomfortable with this decision during the course of the pregnancy. No patient who declined reduction had any discomfort with their decision to continue their pregnancy. Coping strategies in both groups included the maintenance of outside interests, avoiding being homebound, and making use of support groups. Some patients achieving a grand multiple pregnancy following assisted reproduction who pursue fetal reduction have persistent anxiety regarding their decision and the terminated fetuses.

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine acute and persistent psychologic impacts of multifetal pregnancy reductions andpatients' ability to cope with fetal loss while simultaneously bonding to surviving infants. STUDY DESIGN: The first 100 women to undergo a multifetal reduction were invited to participate in a retrospective telephone study assessing their emotional reactions and attitudes toward multifetal reduction. The semistructured interview elicited demographic and obstetric data and contianed scales used in previous studies of reproductive loss, which assessed repetitive thoughts about reduced fetuses, catastrophic fears, and lingering depressive feelings. RESULTS: More than 65% of the sample recalled acute feelings of emotional pain, stress, and fear during the reduction procedure. Mourning for the lost fetuses was reported by 70% of women, but most grieved for only 1 month. Thoughts about reduced fetuses occurred moderately frequently after the reduction but rarely at follow-up. Persistent depressive symptoms were mild, although moderately severe levels of sadness and guilt continued for many. Nonetheless, 93% wold make the same decision again. Emotional reactions of patients who miscarried differed little. The small subsample who continued to be most affected were younger (p < 0.02), were more religious (p < 0.003), and had viewed the multifetal pregnancy on ultrasonography more often (p < 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Multifetal reductions, although highly stressful psychologically, are well tolerated. Sadness and guilt may persist, especially for an identifiable subgroup. Normal maternal bonding and achievement of parenthood goals facilitate grief resolution. The large majority were reconciled to the termination of some fetuses to preserve the lives of a remaining few. © 1995.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People make decisions every day based on their estimates of the chances of various events occurring. By their very nature, these subjective estimates are less certain, and thus more ambiguous, than objective probabilities such as those associated with roulette wheels or lotteries. In two experimental studies, we investigate choices between bets on the decision maker′s knowledge versus bets on a lottery with the same chance of winning. In Study 1, we partially replicate the Heath and Tversky (1991) finding that subjects have an increasing preference for betting on their own knowledge over the matched-chance lottery as probability increases. We also discover a significant minority of subjects who exhibit the opposite pattern and prefer the lottery as probability increases. In addition, we explicitly test the subjects′ attributions about the credit they would feel for a win and the blame they would feel for a loss, and these attributions do provide some explanation for their choice behavior. In Study 2, we manipulate knowledge and accountability, in an attempt to heighten the attributions of credit and blame, and we replicate the findings. © 1995 by Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Self-ratings of health by individuals responding to surveys have shown themselves to be potent predictors of mortality in a growing number of studies; they appear to contribute significant additional independent information to health status indicators gathered through self-reported health histories or medical examinations. A key question raised by these studies is: What are the mediating processes involved in the association? Specifically, do poor self-ratings increase the risk of disability and morbidity, and are these outcomes intervening steps in the link to mortality? In this report we address the first question, of self-ratings predicting future levels of functional disability, our choice of an index of overall impact of morbidity. Data come from the New Haven Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) site (N = 2,812). Results show that self-ratings of health in 1982, net of baseline functional ability, health and sociodemographic status, are associated with changes in functional ability over periods of one through six years. These findings extend our understanding of the meaning of excellent, good, fair, and poor ratings of health, and that they have implications not just for survival but for the loss or maintenance of functional ability in daily life. © 1995 by The Geromological Society of America.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Subjects made or evaluated decisions in hypothetical scenarios. We manipulated knowledge about the outcome and act vs omission in four cases. In case 1 (production processes), acts (changing the process) were considered better than omissions when the decision maker did not know the outcome or knew that it was better than the status quo. Acts were considered worse than omissions once the decision maker learned that the foregone option would have led to an even better outcome. In case 2 (medical treatment), act vs omission again interacted with gain vs loss (relative to the status quo) unless the outcome of the foregone option was known, in which case act vs omission interacted with better vs worse (of the two options). In case 3 (fetal testing), subjects tolerated less risk of miscarriage when a potential for regret was present (because the test with the risk of miscarriage, although better, might miss disorders that another test would detect). This effect was greater for actions than omissions. In case 4 (vaccination), subjects showed less tolerance of vaccine risk when the decision maker would know about the outcome of vaccination or nonvaccination. Thus, the bias toward omission (not vaccinating) is greater when potential regret is present, and potential regret is greater when knowledge of outcomes is expected. © 1995 Academic Press.

Evidence is presented that the need for surrogate decision making covers a full range of decisions affecting the daily lives of residents and their quality of life and not just quality of treatment and health care. Findings from the study suggest that families are highly involved in providing decision making assistance to their relatives or substitute decision making for those who cannot participate in decisions.

      "Abstract: Individuals′ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for risky alternatives was assessed using four different procedures in order to test hypotheses about psychological processes underlying WTP. Key variables manipulated were (1) costs described as losses vs payments (framing), (2) integration vs segregation of costs and risky outcomes, and (3) judgment vs choice-based response mode. The largest and most striking effect was that, contrary to a hypothesis suggested by loss aversion, WTP was actually higher when the cost of an alternative was described as a “loss” than when it was described as a “payment.” This difference was replicated in a second experiment. The Transaction Analysis framework of Fischhoff and Furby (1988) was used to generate a list of contextual factors that might influence subjects′ WTP and perhaps explain this puzzling effect. In Study 2, subjects rated the importance of statements corresponding to these and other factors. These ratings suggested that the operative difference between the “loss” and “payment” conditions was not framing. Instead, implicit norms associated with transactions were apparently evoked less strongly by the loss condition. These results are evidence that experimental manipulations of theoretical interest in behavioral economics may induce unintended disparities between the problem structures and assumptions of researchers and subjects. Beyond the clear methodological implications, these findings point to the need for behavioral decision theorists to pay more attention to the “gap-fillers” and ready-made scripts that individuals bring to every task. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An integration of range-frequency theory, a theory of psychophysical judgment, and prospect theory, a theory of choice behavior under risk, is proposed. A critical assumption of prospect theory is that the reference point, which helps govern the riskiness of choice behavior, is modeled after Helson′s (1964) adaptation level notion. It is proposed that range-frequency theory provides a better representation of the reference point and, thus, can be used to understand with greater precision the judgment of outcomes as gains or losses and the perceived riskiness of subsequent decisions. A computer-based decision task was performed using 199 graduate and undergraduate students. Hypotheses concerning range and frequency effects on the reference point were fully supported. The judgment hypotheses were generally supported under gains, but received inconsistent support under losses. Range and frequency effects on choice were consistent with predictions under both gains and losses with one exception.

      "Abstract: The effects of short-term fluctuations of odds and personal control upon risk-taking behavior in computer blackjack were examined. Although probabilistic models make clear recommendations about optimal play in blackjack (e.g., the basic strategy and card counting), players deviate from optimal play. Those deviations might be explainable by cognitive theories. Risk taking can be explained in terms of irrational cognitions and self-serving evaluations of outcomes; it can also be explained in terms of the available evidence used when people make their decisions. Twelve undergraduate students of the University of Hong Kong played computer blackjack for money. Fluctuations of short-term odds were manipulated as winning or losing streaks, the ability to request extra cards during play was considered to be control of a skill-relevant dimension, and the ability to choose “dealers” was considered to be control of a skill-irrelevant dimension. Recent successful outcomes and the ability to control the skill-relevant factor led to increases in bet size and to stronger self-serving bias in the attribution of the outcomes. Cognitive theories of risk taking that emphasize the evidence available for decisions were supported. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An explanation of the loss-aversion function of prospect theory that relates the theory to a distinction between positive-based and negative-based incentive value was investigated. We predicted that betting decisions would show loss aversion to the extent that they involved necessary goals—goals that were more likely to be negatively based (associated with a threat of negative alternatives). Therefore, conditions that increased perceived goal necessity should have increased the magnitude of the loss-aversion effect. The results from 194 subjects in two studies supported this prediction. Factors related to perceived goal necessity (e.g., telic dominance, imagined proportion of financial assets to be gambled, proportion of assets in a necessities account, actual proportion of income spent on necessities) were related to reluctance to take hypothetical bets. Relationships seemed to be contingent on bet characteristics (amount and win-loss ratio). A third study suggested that these results reflected loss aversion rather than risk aversion. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: To assess patient responses to radical prostatectomy and its effects. Methods: A national sample was taken of 1072 Medicare patients who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer (1988 through 1990) by mail, telephone, and personal interviews. The effects of the surgery and its complications on these patients' lives were studied through: (1) patient ratings of the extent to which sexual and urinary dysfunctions were \"problems\" in their lives; (2) two general measures of quality of life, the Mental Health Index and the General Health Index; (3) patient reports of how they felt about the results of treatment and whether they would choose surgery again. Results: On average, dripping urine, particularly to the point where subjects were wearing pads, had a more significant effect on patients than loss of sexual function; incontinence had significant adverse effects on the measures of quality of life and selfreported results of surgery. Overall, postsurgical patients scored comparatively high on the quality of life measures (similar to a cohort of patients with benigh prostatic hyperplasia who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate), reported feeling positive about the results (81%), and would choose surgical treatment again (89%). Nonetheless, there was variability in patient response to the effects of surgery. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the ability of many Medicare patients to adapt to adverse outcomes, such as loss of sexual function and incontinence. They also provide evidence of the variability of individual patients' responses to surgical results and reinforce the importance of individualized decision making for patients facing a decision about radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. © 1995.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospect theory predicts that people tend to prefer the sure option when choosing between two alternative courses of action framed in terms of gains and prefer the risky option when choosing between two alternatives framed as losses. Related research investigated the impact of emphasizing the probability of the positive outcome of a risky option versus emphasizing the probability of the negative outcome on preference. Most of these studies on the effects of “outcome salience” related their findings to prospect theory′s framing effect. It will be argued that most of these studies inaccurately applied prospect theory to explain the obtained effects and that these might be better understood in terms of salience. In four experiments we test the predictions that (1) choosing between two options in a gain problem will lead to decreased risk preference as compared to loss problems and (2) emphasizing the probability of positive outcomes of a risky option leads to increased preference for this option compared to emphasizing the probability of negative outcomes. Results confirm the impact of both prospect framing and outcome salience and indicate that these effects should be understood in terms of distinct, independent processes. © 1995 Academic Press.

      "Abstract: Most negotiation relationships consist of interactions that occur across time. This paper explores the influence of two variables on the outcomes of such negotiations: the mobility of negotiators and the frame of the short-term sacrifice required to reach long-term gain. Specifically, we focus on the integrativeness of agreements both within a static negotiating period as well as across several negotiations. Subjects participated in an experiment that consisted of 10 similar negotiations across time, with two issues being addressed in each negotiation. The experiment was created to allow for the possibility of a moderately advantageous integrative agreement within each static negotiation, as well as a superior integrative agreement across negotiations. A higher level of negotiator mobility was predicted to decrease the integrativeness of outcomes across negotiations. This prediction was supported. The frame of the sacrifice required of subjects was predicted to affect integrativeness both within as well as across negotiations, such that subjects would be less likely to sacrifice on an issue, or issues, if it meant accepting a perceived loss rather than a reduced gain. This prediction was not supported. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for managerial negotiation and decision making. © 1995 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study examines the impact of two contextual features of decision settings on managers′ risky behavior. Considerable research indicates that decision makers exhibit risk avoiding or risk taking behavior depending upon whether options are viewed as gains or losses with respect to a given reference point. We argue in this paper that multiple points of reference are important determinants of risky behavior in many decision contexts, and that research should explicitly consider their effect to fully understand and predict risky behavior. The analysis of contextual features is extended to consider the impact of prior gains and losses in the second part of the paper. Seventy-two professional corporate managers participated in two experiments that involved a corporate investment decision setting. The setting exemplifies a context that has both multiple important points of reference and prior gains and losses. The data indicated that the presence of multiple relevant reference points results in a complex pattern of risky behavior, where managers′ decisions to accept or avoid risk were affected by the relative positions of risky alternatives with respect to two important points of reference. In particular, a mixture of risk taking and risk avoiding occurred for options between the relevant reference points. The managers were also found to be more willing to accept risk after experiencing a prior gain as opposed to a prior loss. These findings point to the importance of considering such task characteristics when attempting to predict and understand risky behavior across a variety of task contexts. © 1995 Academic Press.

      "Abstract: Objective: To describe the psychosocial processes by which women make the decision to seek care for the symptoms of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI). Design: The qualitative method of grounded theory was used to study the prehospital experience of women with symptoms of AMI. Participants: Sixteen women between the ages of 42 and 82 years who were hospitalized in a coronary care unit after AMI. Results: The women delayed a median of 5.4 hours (range 1.5 to 144 hours). The psychosocial processes by which they made the decision to seek treatment after symptom onset were dynamic and multidimensional. The fundamental structure involved two core categories: (1) maintaining control, and (2) relinquishing control. Within these two core categories there were five subcategories: symptom awareness, perceived insignificance, self-treatment, perceived threat, and lay consultation. Conclusion: Although these women immediately recognized their symptoms as abnormal, they did not acknowledge their seriousness until after the use of a variety of coping mechanisms and self-treatment behaviors to reduce threat and maintain control over the situation. Interventions to reduce delay should focus on the issue of perceived loss of control during symptom onset and attempt to reduce the sense of threat by describing the benefits of seeking treatment early. © 1995 Mosby-Year Book, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Design. - Data were collected during the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment (SUPPORT), a prospective cohort study of outcomes, preferences, and decision making in seriously ill hospitalized adults and their families. Setting. - Five tertiary care hospitals in the United States. Participants. - The 2661 seriously ill patients in nine diagnostic categories who survived their index hospitalization and were discharged home were eligible for this analysis. Surrogate and/or patient interviews about the impact of illness on the family were obtained for 2129 (80%) of these patients (mean age, 62 years; 43% women; 6-month survival, 75%). Outcome Measures. - Surrogates and patients were surveyed to determine the frequency of adverse caregiving and economic burdens. Multivariable analyses were performed to determine correlates of loss of family savings. Results. - One third (34%) of patients required considerable caregiving assistance from a family member. In 20% of cases, a family member had to quit work or make another major life change to provide care for the patient. Loss of most or all of the family savings was reported by 31% of families, whereas 29% reported loss of the major source of income. Patient factors independently associated with loss of the family's savings on multivariable analysis included poor functional status (odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10 to 1.78 for patients needing assistance with three or more activities of daily living), lower family income (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.37 to 2.21 for those with annual incomes below $25 000), and young age (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.13 to 3.82 for those younger than 45 years compared with those 65 years or older). Conclusions. - Many families of seriously ill patients experience severe care-giving and financial burdens. Families of younger, poorer, and more functionally dependent patients are most likely to report loss of most or all of the family's savings.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The sensitivity of a benefit-cost analysis of a data program to incorrect specifications of the cost function C and benefit function B is an important consideration for producers and consumers of the analyses. We consider the effects of misspecification of B or C on the optimal data expenditure and optimal data quality. Geometric and analytical results show when the analysis will be sensitive and when order of magnitude estimates for costs and benefits will suffice in practice. A benefit-cost analysis of the 1970 census illustrates these results. We also show why misspecification of benefits typically has a larger effect than comparable misspecification of costs. If the benefits and the costs are both large but their difference small, the optimal expenditure for data (or optimal data quality) will be highly sensitive to changes in specifications of costs, benefits, data use, etc. In other cases, the sensitivity of the prescribed optimal expenditure to scalemisspecification of costs or benefits depends on the sharpness of the bend of the graph of B versus C near the optimum. Although the prescribed optimal expenditure is the same when B is misspecified as when C is comparably misspecified, the levels of data quality attained can differ. When B is misspecified, the data quality attained decreases if benefits are understated. When C is misspecified, the data quality attained usually decreases if costs are overstated, but for some unusual decision problems it increases and in rare, 'self-correcting' problems, it remains unchanged. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In an analysis of whether to replace STOP signs by YIELD signs, the value of life lost was pegged at $1,500,000 and the value of time at $6.71/hour. These numbers imply that when the sum of traffic delays accumulated by many drivers is equal in duration to the average lifetime lost in a fatal crash (37.3 years), the cost of such delay is higher than the cost of an average lost life. Most find this to be disturbing. If so, why is it that estimates of the value of time and life allegedly based on people's preferences are at odds with what most prefer? A search for the root of this problem leads to Schelling's distinction between the value of death to those who die and the value of the probability of dying to those who live. He thinks that while it is not possible to put a value on one's own death, it is possible to put a value on changes in the probability of one's own death. I think that this distinction does not solve the problem. If it is impossible to have preferences for consequences that would have to be experienced posthumously, it cannot help to make the event of death still more remote by a dimly perceived probability. People may be willing to express preferences and econometricians may be eager to interpret them. But, inasmuch as these preference are vacuous, they have no interpretation and attempts to do so may lead to the noted inconsistency. Consistent use of a wildly incorrect value of life in cost-benefit analyses involving risk leads to consistently incorrect conclusions. Instead of using a questionable value of life in dispassionate-looking computations, it may be better to give legitimacy to public decisions more directly by a mechanism akin to a ballot or a jury. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: What effect does positive and negative feedback about past risk taking have on the future risk taking of decision makers? The results of an experimental study show that subjects who are led to believe they are very competent at decision making see more opportunities in a risky choice and take more risks. Those who are led to believe they are not very competent see more threats and take fewer risks. The feelings of self‐competence and self‐confidence on one task did not generalize to a similar task. Perception of opportunities was unexpectedly not related to the perception of threats. As executives bring their personal perceptual biases to firm decision making, our results identify a serious built‐in bias in SWOT analysis (the analysis of firms' strengths and weaknesses as related to potential opportunities and threats). Executives who believe that they and their firm are very competent will take more risks and vice versa. Our results also provide evidence that the perceived likelihood of an event depends on whether the event is a loss or a gain. Human decision making is subject to the general bias that outcome expectations are not independent of outcome valuations. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Government regulations are an increasingly important component of the environment in which firms operate. Regulations may subject firms to large costs and possibly regulatory‐induced risks, both of which may have effects on stockholders' wealth. In this paper we investigate the valuation effects of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product approvals, rejections and disciplinary decisions on the firms that operate in the food and drug industries. We find that FDA decisions have very large wealth effects. The large price changes associated with approval and rejection decisions suggest that a significant amount of uncertainty about FDA decisions is present almost up to the announcement day. These results are somewhat surprising given the lengthy period of time involved in developing and reviewing drugs and the continuous flow of information received by the market about their potential. We also find some evidence of information leaks preceding FDA announcements. With respect to disciplinary decisions, the evidence from the data suggests that stockholders experience large losses associated with FDA actions. Since these losses represent lost stream of future illegal income, it appears that ignoring FDA rules may be quite profitable for firms that are not caught.

However, in some situations, risk judgments can be represented as an additive combination of probability and utility.

      "Abstract: The reported study is a response to the Kahneman and Tversky (1984; 1988) proposal that systematic examination of alternative framings of decisions offers a useful reflective device that can help decision makers assess the values that should be attached to the primary and secondary consequences of their choices. We investigate the effect of social interaction as a mediator of responses to the theater ticket problems of Tversky and Kahneman (1981). The hypothesis is supported that attending the theater with a friend (social interaction) versus alone reduced the effect of the lost ticket versus the loss of a $10 bill on willingness to spend a second $10 to see the play. A further hypothesis, that social interaction results in a positive main effect on attending the theater after the ticket ($10 bill) loss receives limited support. The results support the views of Payne (1982), Schoemaker (1982), and Bettman, Johnson, and Payne (1991) that context effects influence a decision maker's judgment and, hence, the outcome of the decision process. © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

      "Abstract: This research concerned satisfaction with outcome‐differences (advantageous inequity, equity, or disadvantageous inequity) as a function of the individual's gain or loss frame, other's gain or loss frame, the cooperative or noncooperative nature of the relationship, and their interactions. After reading a scenario, subjects rated on a satisfaction‐dissatisfaction scale a series of outcome‐pairs providing themselves and another party with outcomes. Consistent with Equity Theory, results showed that gain framed individuals found equity more pleasing than advantageous inequity, which in turn was preferred over disadvantageous inequity, but only when the decision making context was coopera‐ tive rather than noncooperative. In a noncooperative context, gain framed individuals were as pleased with equity as with advantageous inequity. Contrary to Equity Theory, but consistent with Prospect Theory, loss framed individuals were relatively insensitive to outcome‐differences and the nature of the relationship. Results finally suggested that advantageous inequity was preferred less when the other party had a loss rather than gain frame, albeit only under cooperative circumstances.

      "Abstract: This study assesses the impact of accountability, the status quo, and anticipated costs and benefits on judgement of the acceptability of a drug in the US pharmaceuticals market. Several effects are documented: (1) subjects were more accepting of a drug, the lower the anticipated risks of side effects and the greater the anticipated benefits; (2) subjects were especially unwilling to accept risk when the drug was not yet on the market and when they felt accountable for their decisions; (3) accountable subjects confronted by an off‐the‐market drug that posed moderate or high risk were also especially likely to procrastinate, to buckpass, and to think in integratively complex ways about the problem, notwithstanding the fact that many more lives would be saved than lost. We explain these results by positing that perceptual‐cognitive processes (loss aversion) and political processes (blame avoidance) mutually reinforce each other when decision makers are accountable for choices that raise the possibility of changing the status quo in ways that impose losses on identifiable constituencies. We conclude by commenting on the complex normative issues that arise in labelling response tendencies as biases. Choices that look irrational within one ethical or political framework sometimes appear quite reasonable with another. Copyright © 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study explores the differences between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs in the city-state of Singapore with regard to the risks involved in the decision to become an entrepreneur. The sample is composed of 30 Chinese entrepreneurs and 44 Singaporean managers and engineers employed by six multinational corporations. Whether or not entrepreneurs are more risk-oriented than managers is not clear from this study but the data from this study demonstrate that entrepreneurs are able to give up job security and take specific kinds of risks related to launching a new venture because they have confidence that they will either succeed or be capable of carrying on a successful career. Whereas job security is a critical variable that holds non-entrepreneurs to the status quo in Singapore, the potential loss of self-respect and self-image, the fear of failure, appears to be a force that drives Chinese entrepreneurs in Singapore to succeed. Although the research for this study began from the widely held premise that risk was a psychological attribute, the research process revealed that risk is more productively seen as a decision-making variable. The research in this study, like previous studies on entrepreneurs and risk, also assumes that choice was the core of risk-taking. It is doubtful, however, that individuals have a generalized risk-propensity, for risk is highly contextual. Risk is most likely to be seen in specific kinds of entrepreneurial decisions such as the decision to become an entrepreneur, the decision to grow a new venture through new product development, international market entry or other strategic options, and decisions related to control issues. Risk should be viewed as part of a complex multivariate process and attention needs to be given in the future to the study of risk identification, risk assessment, formulation of risk strategies, and the management of risk. Risk is an inherent aspect of any opportunity and, consequently, is the darker side of the heart of entrepreneurship. In a Chinese entrepreneurial setting these factors and decisions are part of a complex social process. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: To evaluate the economic consequences of a routine varicella vaccination program that targets healthy children. —Decision analysis was used to compare the costs, outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of a routine vaccination program with no intervention. Clinical outcomes were based on a mathematical model of vaccine efficacy that relied on published and unpublished data and on expert opinion. Medical utilization rates and costs were collected from multiple sources, including the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program and the California Hospital Discharge Database. —A routine varicella vaccination program for healthy children would prevent 94% of all potential cases of chickenpox, provided the vaccination coverage rate is 97% at school entry. It would cost approximately $162 million annually if one dose of vaccine per child were recommended at a cost of $35 per dose. From the societal perspective, which includes work-loss costs as well as medical costs, the program would save more than $5 for every dollar invested in vaccination. However, from the health care payer's perspective (medical costs only), the program would cost approximately $2 per chickenpox case prevented, or $2500 per life-year saved. The medical cost of disease prevention was sensitive to the vaccination coverage rate and vaccine price but was relatively insensitive to assumptions about vaccine efficacy within plausible ranges. An additional program for catch-up vaccination of 12-year-olds would have high incremental costs if the vaccination coverage rate of children of preschool age were 97%, but would result in net savings at a coverage rate of 50%. —A routine varicella vaccination program for healthy children would result in net savings from the societal perspective, which includes work-loss costs as well as medical costs. Compared with other prevention programs, it would also be relatively cost-effective from the health care payer's perspective. (JAMA. 1994;271:375-381). © 1994 American Medical Association.

      "Abstract: A substantial body of work has been performed developing models for decision making under adversarial conditions. To date however, little attention has been paid to the underlying motivation of the decision makers or how the decision process actually functions in the corporate environment when adversarial relationships exist between departments. In this paper adversarial decisions are analyzed using Allison's conceptual framework, strategic assumption surfacing and testing (SAST), and agency theory. The performance of the SAST method is found to be linked to the descriptive model that best represents the decision making process and whether the analyst subscribes to agency theory as a valid motivator for individual decisions within the organization. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: According to traditional models of deindividuation, lowered personal identifiability leads to a loss of identity and a loss of internalized control over behaviour This account has been challenged by arguing that manipulations of identifiability affect the relative salience of personal or social identity and hence the choice of standards to control behaviour The present study contributes to an extension of this argument according to which identifiability manipulations do not only affect the salience of social identity but also the strategic communication of social identity. Reicher and Lvine (1993) have shown that subjects who are more identifiable to a powerful outgroup will moderate the expression of those aspects of ingroup identity which differ from the outgroup position and which would be punished by the outgroup. Here we seek to show that in addition, subjects who are more identifiable to a powerful outgroup will accentuate the expression of those aspects of ingroup identity which differ from the outgroup position but which would not be punished by the outgroup. This is because, when identifiable, subjects may use such responses as a means of publicly presenting their adherence to group norms and hence as a means of establishing their right to group membership. A study is reported in which 102 physical education students are either identifiable (I) or not identifiable (NI) to their academic tutors. They are asked to respond on a number of dimensions where pilot interviews show the ingroup stereotype to differ from outgroup norms. Expressions of difference from the outgroup position would lead to punishment on some of these dimensions (P items) but would not lead to punishment for others (NP items) The predicted interaction between identifiability and item type is highly significant. As expected, for NP items identifiability accentuates responses which differentiate the ingroup stereotype from outgroup norms. All these results occur independently of shifts in the salience of social identity. The one unexpectedfinding is that, for P items, identifiability does lead to decreased expression of the ingroup stereotype, but the diference does not reach significance. Nonetheless, overall the results do provide further evidence for the complex effects of identifiability on strategic considerations underlying the expression of social identity in intergroup contexts.

      "Abstract: Information technology (IT) projects can fail for any number of reasons, and can result in considerable financial losses for the organizations that undertake them. One pattern of failure that has been observed but seldom studied is the runaway project that takes on a life of its own. Such projects exhibit characteristics that are consistent with the broader phenomenon known as escalating commitment to a failing course of action. Several theories have been offered to explain this phenomenon, including self-justification theory and the so-called sunk cost effect which can be explained by prospect theory. This paper discusses the results of a scries of experiments designed to test whether the phenomenon of escalating commitment could be observed in an IT context Multiple experiments conducted within and across cultures suggest that a high level of sunk cost may influence decision makers to escalate their commitment to an IT project In addition to discussing this and other findings from an ongoing stream of research, the paper focuses on the challenges faced in carrying out the experiments.© 1995 M.E.

This article reviews these phenomena and discusses their implications. The first part discusses the evidence for reference dependence and introduces the principle of loss aversion for both certain and uncertain choice. The second part discusses context effects in choice, and introduces the principle of tradeoff contrast.

      "Abstract: The way that choices are framed or presented to consumers may exert a significant impact on preferences. With few exceptions, past experiments have always framed choices for decision makers. Six studies examined how people themselves frame ambiguous events. Using a scenario format, Study 1 demonstrated that subjects interpreted paying back a loan as a gain rather than as a loss. Study 2 replicated this finding with a methodology where subjects actually received a loan of real money from the experimenter. Study 3 showed that the tendency to view paying back a loan as a gain was greater when the loan was for oneself rather than another person. Study 4 replicated the initial finding using a choice dilemma similar to those used by Tversky and Kahneman (1981). Studies 5 and 6 showed that people view selling a possession as a gain. However, Study 5 also showed that buyers do not display this tendency. These data suggest that the tendency to frame actions as gains will be moderated by role expectations and the bias to view one's actions in a positive light. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

      "Abstract: Much of decision aiding uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to help people with risky decisions. Assessing the utility of outcomes and one's degree of belief in their likelihood are assumed to be separable tasks, the results of which can then be combined to determine the preferred alternative. Evidence from different areas of psychology now provides a growing consensus that this assumption is too simplistic. Observed dependencies in the evaluation of uncertain outcomes and the likelihood of the events giving rise to them are frequent and systematic. Dependencies seem to derive from general strategic processes that take into consideration asymmetric costs of over- vs. underestimates of uncertain quantities. This asymmetric-loss-function interpretation provides a psychological explanation for observed judgments and decisions under uncertainty and links them to other judgment tasks. The decision weights estimated when applying dependent-utility models to choices are not simply reflections of perceived subjective probability but a response to several constraints, all of which modify the weight of risky or uncertain outcomes.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper we attempt to formalize the idea that a mechanism that involves multilateral communication between buyers and sellers may be dominated by one that involves simple bilateral communication. To do this we consider the well known problem in which a seller tries to sell a single unit of output to a group of N buyers who have independently distributed private valuations. Our arguments hinge on two considerations. First, buyers communicate their willingness to negotiate with the seller sequentially, and second, buyers have the option of purchasing the good from some alternative supplier. It is shown that the seller cannot improve upon a procedure in which she offers the good to each buyer in turn at a fixed price. The seller reverts to multilateral communication if possible, only when no buyer is willing to pay the fixed price. In reasonable environments buyers will be too impatient to wait for the outcome of a multilateral negotiation and all communications will be bilateral. In many problems in mechanism design, informed traders have no alternative to participation in the mechanism that is offered by its designer. The best mechanism from the designer's point of view is then the one that is most efficient at extracting informational rents, that is, a simple auction. In a competitive environment it is likely to be costly for buyers to participate in an auction or any other multilateral selling scheme in which the seller must process information from many different buyers because alternative trading opportunities will be disappearing during the time that the seller is collecting this information. Buyers might be willing to participate in an auction, but only if they could be guaranteed that the competition that they face will not eliminate too much of their surplus. At the other extreme to the auction is a simple fixed price selling scheme 1. The seller simply waits until he meets a buyer whose valuation is high enough, given the opportunities that exist in the rest of the market, for him to be willing to pay this price. The seller extracts the minimum of the buyer's informational rents since the price that a buyer pays is independent of his valuation. Yet the seller might like this scheme if adding a second bidder to the process makes it very difficult for him to find a buyer with a valuation high enough to want to participate. In the presence of opportunity costs, the seller faces a trade-off between his ability to extract buyers informational rents and his ability to find buyers who are willing to participate in any competitive process. In practice this trade-off will impose structure on the method that is used to determine a price. In markets where there are auctions, limits are put on buyer participation. In tobacco auctions bids are submitted at a distinct point in time from buyers who are present at that time. In real estate auctions time limits are put on the amount of time the seller will wait before making a decision. These restrictions on participation are presumably endogenously selected by the seller (possibly in competition with other mechanism designers) with this trade-off in mind. On the other hand, markets in which objects appear to trade at a fixed price are rarely so simple. A baker with a fixed supply of fresh bagels is unlikely to collect bids from buyers and award the bagels to the high bidder at the end of the day. Buyers are unlikely to be willing to participate in such a scheme since they can buy fresh bagels from a competitor down the street. Yet despite the fact that bagels sell at a fixed price throughout the day, most bakers are more than willing to let it be known that they will discount price at the end of the day on any bagels that they have not yet sold. Selling used cars presents a similar problem. Each potential buyer for the used car is likely to have inspected a number of alternatives, and is likely to know the prices at which these alternative can be obtained. A seller who suggests that buyers submit a bid, then wait until the seller is sure that no higher offer will be submitted is asking buyers to forgo these alternative opportunities with no gain to themselves. To avoid the rigidity of the pure fixed price scheme most used cars are sold for a fixed price or best offer. These examples suggest that the best selling mechanism may involve a complex interplay between participation and surplus extraction considerations. The purpose of this paper is to provide a simple formalism within which the factors that determine the best contract can be evaluated. We consider the best known environment from the point of view of auction design in which there are a large number of buyers with independent private valuations for a unit of an indivisible commodity that is being sold by a single supplier who acts as the mechanism designer. We modify this standard problem in two critical ways. First, we assume that the seller meets the potential buyers sequentially rather than all at once. Secondly we assume that buyers have a valuable alternative that yields them a sure surplus. This creates a simple bidding cost that is effectively the expected loss in surplus (created by the disappearance of outside alternatives) that the buyer faces during the time that he spends negotiating with the seller. These simple assumptions allow us to calculate the impact of competition and communication costs using completely standard arguments from the mechanism design literature. We are able to show that with these assumptions the seller's expected surplus will be highest if the object is sold according to the following modified fixed price scheme: the seller contacts each of the potential buyers in turn and either offers to negotiate or announces that he no longer wishes to trade. If he offers to negotiate and the buyer agrees, the buyer immediately has the option of trading for sure with the seller at a fixed price set ex ante. If the buyer does not wish to pay this fixed price, he may submit an alternative bid. The seller will then continue to contact new buyers, returning to trade with the buyer only if no buyer wishes to pay the fixed price and no higher bid is submitted. It will be clear that in our environment, both the simple fixed price scheme and the simple auction are feasible. The simple auction prevails when the fixed price is set equal to the maximum possible valuation, while the simple fixed price scheme occurs when the fixed price is set so that buyers are willing to participate if and only if they are willing to pay the fixed price. Our results will show that a simple auction in never optimal for the seller. The seller can always strictly improve his payoff by moving to a scheme in which there is some strictly positive probability that trade will occur at the fixed price. On the other hand, there are reasonable circumstances in which the seller cannot achieve a higher payoff than the one she gets by selling at a fixed price. It is shown that for any positive participation cost, there is a large, but finite, number of potential buyers so that the seller cannot achieve a higher payoff than what she gets by selling at a fixed price. Two simple, but important continuity results are also illustrated. As the cost of participation in the mechanism increases (decreases), the probability with which the seller's unit of output is sold at a fixed price goes to one (zero) in the best modified fixed price mechanism for the seller. Our paper is not the first to generate such a modified fixed price scheme. Both McAfee and McMillan (1988) and Riley and Zeckhauser (1983) come up with similar schemes for the case in which the seller must bear a fixed cost for each new buyer that she contacts. There are two essential differences between our model and theirs. First, as the cost is interpreted as the opportunity cost of participation in the mechanism, it is reasonable to imagine that the seller advertises the mechanism ex ante. Another way of putting this is that the seller pays a fixed rather than a variable cost to communicate the mechanism to buyers. This makes it possible to assume that the mechanism is common knowledge to the seller and all the buyers at the beginning of the communication process. For this reason we can make our case using completely standard arguments. Secondly, the mechanism in the opportunity cost case plays a different allocative role than it does in the case when the seller bears a cost. The mechanism must decide whether buyers should communicate with the seller or pursue their alternative activities, as well as who should trade and at what price. It is this allocative role that makes bilateral communication superior to multilateral communication in a competitive environment. These differences allow us to show, for example, that a simple fixed price scheme is undominated for the seller when the number of buyers is finite. As shown by McAfee and McMillan, this is only possible when the number of potential buyers is infinite when the seller bears the cost of communication. Remarkably, the existence of opportunity costs to buyer participation is not, by itself, sufficient to explain why sellers might prefer bilateral communications mechanisms. Samuelson (1983) and McAfee and McMillan (1987) show that when buyers must pay a fixed cost to submit a bid, which is equivalent to giving up a valuable alternative, a seller cannot expect to earn more than she does in a second price auction (though Samuelson shows that the reserve price may depend on the number of potential buyers). One of the contributions of this paper is to show that the assumption that buyers make their participation decisions simultaneously is critical to this result. Simultaneous entry decisions means that whether or not any particular buyer is assigned to the alternative activity is independent of any other buyer's valuation. With sequential communication the seller is able to relax this constraint. It is precisely the enlargement of the class of feasible mechanism that breaks down the optimality of the simple auction. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study focuses on the stock market effects associated with the announcements of product approvals, denials and recalls by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the impact of product approvals on research and development expenditures (R&D) and forecasts of earnings by Value Line. When the FDA announces approvals, the shareholder wealth of affected firms increases significantly. The announcements of denials and recalls by the FDA are associated with stock price declines. The stock price impact of recalls is dependent on whether the firm voluntarily withdraws a product or if the withdrawal is mandated by the FDA. Specifically, voluntary recalls are not associated with a change in stockholder wealth, while FDA mandated recalls are associated with decreases in stock price. In addition, we find that partial product recalls have a smaller impact than total recalls. An examination of the effects on competitors’ stock price reveals losses when the FDA announces an approval or a recall, but no impact for a denial. An analysis of changes in risk around FDA decisions suggests that, on average, betas do not change around approvals, recalls or denials. In addition, our results suggest that announcement period stock price behavior is unrelated to risk changes except for approvals where returns are positive and significant for firms with either increasing risk or no change in risk. We also find that approvals are associated with increases in R&D and forecasts of earnings for the sample firms, with returns to stockholders upon announcement of the approval being related to the increases in R&D and short-term earnings forecasts. © 1994, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The study involved 48 students from Flinders University and Melbourne University who were administered 25 decision trials on which they could win or lose money. Information search behaviour was measured by the DEAN procedure (Ball & Mann, 1991), a process‐tracing package for recording and analysing information search patterns for problems presented in decision matrix format. The relationship between information search behaviour and risky choice was examined. It was found that the individual's search processes and strategies are related to the nature of subsequent choices. Individuals who searched little information were more likely to choose risky, money‐losing options. The findings, which demonstrate consistency between search and choice, indicate that different parts of the decision‐making process are coherent. 1994 Australian Psychological Society\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article takes issue with the rational choice approach that views the economy as an autonomous realm where isolated individuals make maximizing choices in terms of their personal preferences. The argument made is that income generation, consumption and exchange form a holistic complex that must be studied in its unity and that the economy and individual economic behaviour are articulated with a social context. This is demonstrated by evidence (collected through fieldwork) on the differences in the use of remittances by three villages in Kerala, India, which have experienced large scale migration to the Middle Eastern countries. In the three cases, it was the way in which income earned from international migration was perceived, together with the variation in ethnic structures, that explained the similarities and differences in their consumption, exchange and investment patterns. In each case, it was the larger ethnic structure that conditioned (1) the types of activities into which the money was channelled; (2) the range of people who were the beneficiaries of migrant remittances; (3) the patterns of reciprocity or charity practised by the migrants; (4) the selection of the trade‐off point between community status and economic accumulation; and; (5) the groups of individuals who gained or lost economic control. © 1994 Institute of Social Studies\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Excess use of fertilizer-N results in leaching of nitrate, which threatens the environment in various ways. Taxes on nitrogen fertilizers have been suggested as a measure to reduce the nitrogen load to the environment. An economic model for predicting the farmers' decisions regarding fertilizer application, and an ecological model which predicts the nitrate leaching given these decisions is presented. From economic theory it is known that the economic optimal amount of fertilizer is where the value of the marginal product equals the input factor price. Marginal yields are derived from the estimated yield curves and fertilizer-N levels which maximize farmers' profits. Based on the economic models' predictions of the profit-maximizing fertilization practice, nitrate losses were predicted by the SOIL-SOILN model. High N-tax levels (> 200%) are needed to affect the nitrate leaching significantly. However, lower taxes may have an indirect effect on the ecology of farmlands by improving the economics of other measures against nitrogen losses. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People with low self-esteem (LSE) seem to focus on self-protection; rather than trying to achieve gains for their self-esteem, they try to avoid losses. This research examined, in a social comparison context, the hypothesis that LSEs seek self-enhancement when they have an opportunity that is \"safe,\" that is, carrying little risk of humiliation. Experiments 1 and 2 indicated that LSEs sought the most social comparisons after receiving success feedback, whereas high-self-esteem Ss (HSEs) sought the most comparisons after failure. Further results suggested that LSEs who succeeded were seizing a safe means of self-enhancement and that HSEs who failed were seeking to compensate for the failure. Also supporting this interpretation for LSEs was Experiment 3, in which LSEs who succeeded sought the most comparisons when such comparisons promised to be favorable. All three studies illustrate the value of a new measure of social comparison selection.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In a group of 30 women who underwent induced delivery after they had been informed of a lethal fetal anomaly, 18 women reported that this was the outcome of a clear decision process and 12 reported that they had no choice. In contrast to findings in other research areas, the experience of having perceived control was not associated with lower grief scores three months after perinatal loss.; Perceived control over perinatal death through induced abortion was not associated, as hypothesized, with lower grief scores 3 months after perinatal loss in a comparison study conducted in The Netherlands. Included in the analysis were 30 women who underwent pregnancy termination at 24 weeks of gestation and above because prenatal diagnosis revealed a fetal malformation that was incompatible with extrauterine life or would result in an extreme mental or physical handicap. The control group was comprised of 30 women who underwent induced delivery resulting in perinatal death. The median gestational age in the study group was 31 weeks. 18 (60%) of subjects were categorized as having perceived control over the perinatal death on the basis of their agreement with the statement: \"I wished to have the pregnancy terminated, because it was useless to wait any longer.\" The remaining 12 expressed a lack of perceived control, as evidenced by their feeling: \"I did not have any choice.\" There were no significant differences among subjects when the Perinatal Grief Scale was administered 3 months after the pregnancy termination.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper concerns the optimal control of input to a FIFO jobshop with a single workstation. The input is jobs for which the processing and delivery times are observable upon arrival. The control is exercised by charging a price for each completed job. The objective is either profit maximization or welfare maximization. The semi-Markov decision processes that maximize the two objectives are studied simultaneously. Optimal prices are specified in terms of opportunity costs. The opportunity cost of a job is the expected future loss of earnings caused by having the job submitted to the shop. Results for the cases with and without discounting are established simultaneously by a new approach. It is based on the idea of studying the infinite-horizon model directly and it allows the state space and the decision set to be denumerable. Mild assumptions ensure that the opportunity cost is increasing as a function of the work backlog, and increasing and convex as a function of the processing time.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many reinforcement learning approaches can be formulated using the theory of Markov decision processes and the associated method of dynamic programming (DP). The value of this theoretical understanding, however, is tempered by many practical concerns. One important question is whether DP-based approaches that use function approximation rather than lookup tables can avoid catastrophic effects on performance. This note presents a result of Bertsekas (1987) which guarantees that small errors in the approximation of a task's optimal value function cannot produce arbitrarily bad performance when actions are selected by a greedy policy. We derive an upper bound on performance loss that is slightly tighter than that in Bertsekas (1987), and we show the extension of the bound to Q-learning (Watkins, 1989). These results provide a partial theoretical rationale for the approximation of value functions, an issue of great practical importance in reinforcement learning. © 1994, Kluwer Academic Publishers.

      "Abstract: Symptom control is the essence of palliative care but is not without problems, especially in the difficult socio-economic conditions of a developing country. We present our experience with over 2000 hospice admissions over six years in India's first hospice, to highlight our problems and the measures we have taken to solve them. The prevalent habit of tobacco smoking and chewing in India gives rise to a high incidence of head and neck cancers which form 50% of our admissions. Another 24% is formed by breast and gynaecological cancers. The difficult symptoms in head and neck cancers are pain, dysphagia, fungation and trismus. Almost 25% of our head and neck cancers have feeding tubes, which we feel are justified and most useful for medication and basic nutrition. Difficult problems in gynaecological cancers are pain, chronic blood loss, ulcerations and fistulae. The inadequate or sporadic availability of oral and injectable morphine adds to our problems in pain control. Non-compliance of patients to take adequate medications and the resistance from relatives make it sometimes difficult to achieve optimum symptom control. India has many systems of alternate and unorthodox medicine. We find that these are best tried outside the hospice unless they are in fully-studied clinical trials. In the end there is always the difficult choice of either remaining in the hospice for optimal symptom control or going back to their homes, where this may not be available.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: According to prospect theory, risk attitude changes depending on whether a prospect is perceived as a gain or a loss relative to a reference or aspiration level. To investigate risk attitude with respect to years of life, the authors elicited utilities at two occasions by the certainty equivalent method from 30 women from the general population. The respondents gave certainty equivalents to gambles with years of life. The gambles were two-outcome gambles with equal probabilities to experience each outcome. A shift from a risk-seeking towards a risk-averse attitude was observed with increasing expected value of the gambles. For each individual, the averaged responses over the two replications were fitted with an s- shaped logistic curve that showed an excellent fit (r2 ≥ 0.97) for all respondents. The aspiration level of survival can be derived from this function and was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.43, p < 0.025). The data are consistent with prospect theory and may explain why patients opt for risky treatments, since most of the respondents were risk-seeking in the short term. © 1994, Sage Publications.

      "Abstract: When offered an opportunity to win $1 on every \"win\" trial in which they drew a red jelly bean, subjects frequently elected to draw from a bowl that contained a greater absolute number, but a smaller proportion, of red beans (e.g., 7 in 100) than from a bowl with fewer red beans but better odds (e.g., 1 in 10). Subjects reported that although they knew the probabilities were against them, they felt they had a better chance when there were more red beans. Similar, but less extreme results were obtained on \"lose\" trials, where drawing a red bean meant losing $1. These results were predicted from the concretive and experiential principles of cognitive-experiential self-theory. Nonoptimal choices in the laboratory were significantly correlated with heuristic responses to relevant vignettes and with self-reported gambling in real life.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background and Purpose. In clinical trials stroke is reported as a major morbid outcome, but the impact of stroke on patients is not directly assessed. This study examines patient preferences for different outcomes of stroke, including death. MethodsWe presented patients with written case scenarios of stroke outcomes. The scenarios represented four categories of stroke severity (mild, moderate, severe, and fatal), and for nonfatal strokes the scenarios described motor, language, and cognitive deficits. Patients reported values for each of the 10 stroke scenarios using a rank-and-scale method over a 100-point range, with 100 representing perfect health and 0 corresponding to the worst possible health state. ResultsOne hundred seventeen of 209 consecutive patients at risk for stroke participated in this study. Severe strokes were uniformly rated as having low preference weights (mean ± SD [median]: 3±4 [1] for disabling hemiplegia, 8±9 [5] for confusion, and 15 ± 14 [10] for global aphasia), and severe motor impairment (a disabling hemiplegia) was rated as significantly worse than death. Even mild deficits resulted in substantial loss to patients (54±21 [55] for dysarthria and 53±21 [50] for mild anomia). ConclusionsStrokes may result in a wide variety of poststroke consequences for patients. Severe strokes may be viewed by patients as tantamount to or worse than death. Even mild strokes may cause significant declines in patient preferences for health states. These data are useful in interpreting studies that report stroke and death, in designing new studies that measure stroke in at-risk populations, and in helping patients reach treatment decisions about therapies designed to prevent strokes. © 1994 American Heart Association, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Diagnosis of breast cancer causes great psychological stress. In addition to the fact that the patient is suffering from a life-threatening disease, she is confronted with a possible amputation of the breast. The female breast has a lot of real and symbolic significance for motherhood and femininity, and if one includes erotic and cosmetic aspects it is easy to see why its loss is perceived as a serious damage to femininity and sex appeal. The advent of breast-conserving surgery as an option has aroused many hopes of removing most of the psychological stress from the patients and improving their quality of life. Patients and Methods: Within llie framework of Ihis sluJy the quality of life of women with primary breast cancer was investigated in dependence on their age and the nature of the operation. 27 wom- en who had a breast-conserving operation and 81 who had a modification of Patey's radical mas- tectomy were included in the study. 42 women in the latter group were under 60 years of age and the other 39 women were over 60. There were no significant differences in the description of the groups of patients, with the exception of the postoperative follow-up time, which was an average shorter in the patients who had the breast-conserving operation: 2.01 years compared to 2.84 years after mas- tectomy. The patients were all assessed with the Karnofsky index which was above 50%. Two ques- tionnaires were used: one of them was developed by a Mannheim Working group, the other was a validated test instrument of a Dutch working group under Mrs. dc llaes. The chi-square lest was used for significance tests. The following areas of quality of life were investigated: emotional stress, functional status and physical symptoms, family and social contacts, sexuality, body image and femi- ninity. Additional points looked at were information on the disease, attitude to self-help groups, and an overall assessment of the quality of life. Results: Women who had had a mastectomy felt significantly more often that they were less attrac- tive physically than before the operation, and more often developed the feeling of incomplete womanhood. The older woman also suffers from reduced physical attractiveness and the feeling of incomplete womanhood. When ages were compared, there was significantly more often a poorer overall assessment of the quality of life and a poorer functional status and Karnofsky index after the mastectomy in the group over 60 years. In all other areas (emotional stress, social contacts, sexu- ality and body image) there were no significant agc-dcpcndcnt differences. Conclusions: This study throws new light on the question to what extent the breast-conserving proce- dure is advantageous to older women. We found lhat older women after mastectomy suffer as much from the loss of a breast as younger women, i.e. they develop exactly the same feeling of no longer being a whole woman. The above results contradict statements by many authors who favor the bieast-conserving procedure for younger women, and w ho question the benefit of this procedure for older or old women. This result argues for including older patients as w ell in the decision about the surgical procedure. © 1994 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Increased attention has recently been paid to the impact of illness on the well-being of households in developing countries. This has been a particular theme in the case of malaria, but relatively little evidence is available on how households react to malaria and on its impact on expenditure and time allocation patterns. This paper reports the results of a study designed to investigate the economic consequences of malaria for households in Nepal. A household survey of malaria cases in two districts provided information on use of various sources of treatment, their cost to households, time lost by the person with malaria, the extent to which others inside or outside the household provided assistance with the normal work of the malaria patient, the time spent caring for a child with malaria and any financial losses associated with the malaria episode. Out-of-pocket expenditure on treatment differed greatly between the two districts, for reasons associated with the choice of public or private sources of treatment and the number of visits made per episode. The majority of households appeared to cope without great difficulty with the reduction in labour supply caused by a malaria episode, by drawing largely on the time of adult family members. Caution is advised in extrapolating the results to other situations, given the extent to which local factors are likely to influence the impact on households. Moreover, the findings relate to a situation where a malaria control programme is in place: a relatively greater impact per household would occur in the absence of control. However, it is argued that such surveys have value in informing health policy, particularly in relation to setting priorities and treatment policy. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A significant body of research indicates that managers often continue projects which logically should be discontinued to prevent subsequent losses to their firms. Affective explanations are usually provided for these apparently illogical decisions; for example, feelings of personal responsibility may bias the managers' evaluation of a project. In contrast, this study employs two agency theory concepts to investigate whether a rational explanation may exist for these decisions. A decision-making experiment was performed to examine the prediction that project managers who both experienced an incentive to shirk and possessed privately held information would exhibit a greater tendency to continue a project which was expected to become unprofitable than would those who experienced only one or neither of these conditions. Consistent with agency theory, the results indicate these two factors interact, providing support for the predicted relationships. Implications for the design of management incentive and control systems and suggestions for further research are presented. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

We independently manipulated the value of the status quo and the assignment of the better or worse outcome to an act or an omission. Acts leading to the worse outcome were always considered worse than omissions leading to the worse outcome. This act-omission difference was reduced or reversed for the better outcome. Most experiments showed an overall bias toward omissions (combining better and worse). Little evidence was found for greater omission bias for losses relative to the status quo than for gains. A bias toward maintaining the status quo itself was found, however, independently of omission bias.

      "Abstract: This paper examines the influence of affect′s two primary dimensions, Pleasantness and Arousal, on risk-taking behaviors. In Study 1, higher levels of Arousal led subjects to pay less for insurance to protect themselves from potential losses. In Study 2, a between-subjects design examined willingness-to-pay for statistically equivalent lotteries and insurance. Higher Arousal led to higher risk-seeking expressed as higher willingness-to-pay for lotteries but lower willingness-to-pay for insurance. Higher Negative Affectivity (i.e., Unpleasantness and high Arousal) led to higher willingness-to-pay for insurance for possible losses of substantial value. Also, higher Calmness (i.e., Pleasantness and low Arousal) led to greater willingness-to-pay for lotteries. The results are interpreted in terms of two mechanisms: (i) congruency between Pleasantness and selected risk-taking decision strategy and (ii) Arousal-induced restriction in attentional capacity. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Managers′ reports of their own reactions to risk suggest that decision makers may feel they can control both the likelihood and the magnitude of future potential losses (March & Shapira, 1987). As a consequence, delayed losses appear much less intimidating than immediate losses because delayed losses are heavily discounted. However, if decision makers discount losses more heavily than gains, or if future loss seems less credible than gain, decision makers will make more risky choices when outcomes are delayed than when they are immediate. These are the ideas explored in this study. The questions addressed are: (1) Do decision makers discount gain and loss asymmetrically, with higher loss than gain rates, and (2) is the uncertainty (implicit risk) associated with future loss outcomes greater than that associated with gain outcomes? Lottery ratings were used to fit three intertemporal choice models, each of which represents a particular time-discounting or implicit-risk hypothesis. The resulting time and implicit risk parameter estimates were used to test hypotheses about discounting asymmetries. A significant number of subjects discount loss faster than gain. Both implicit risk and time discount rates were higher for loss than gain. Thus, the asymmetry detected in this study is in the direction that would induce greater risk tolerance with delay as predicted in Miller′s (1959) conflict theory. The results also reflect managers′ optimistic view of the future and their belief in their eventual mastery of it. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of analysing a company's risk exposures is to gain an understanding of the risks that the company faces. Only then can the likely level of future losses be estimated, and decisions about how best to manage these risks be made. To gain a full understanding, we first need to adjust for a number of external factors to ensure that all data are on a consistent basis. The historic data can then be analysed and the level of variability determined. After identifying appropriate probability distributions for the frequency and severity of the risks, simulations can be run to make forecasts.Once forecasts have been made, the best way to manage and finance the risks can be considered. As such decisions typically depend upon many factors, utility theory can be used to summarize the advantage that the company will obtain from each alternative in a given situation. This will involve defining a utility function for the company. Methods of eliciting these utility functions exist, including influence diagrams. Decision theory can consequently be applied to determine the best course of action using the company's utility function and its beliefs about the future. Uncertainty inherent in the information can therefore be incorporated in the decision process rather than be ignored. The decision will also depend upon the ability of the company to sustain a loss from retained risks and regulatory requirements relating to the risks. © 1993 Oxford University Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The interface between grief, an intrapsychic and behavioral response to bereavement, and mourning, a process involving the social and cultural prescriptions for the expression of grief, has seldom been examined. Using data from a qualitative study on the effects of an elderly parent 's death on adult daughters, this paper provides evidence that grief and mourning influence each other. Individual response to loss can be understood by examining interwoven intrapsychic and socially evaluative domains. Individuals struggling to incorporate these two, sometimes conflicting, dimensions may in part make choices in their own experiences of and responses to bereavement. This paper suggests that the internal debate involved in balancing personal and cultural forces not only leads to control of the expression of grief, but molds the intrapsychic experience of grief as well. For example, the need to control grief both serves to shape and contain it, and assists in maintaining an enduring tie with the deceased elderly parent. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Much of decision aiding uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to help people with risky decisions. Assessing the utility of outcomes and one's degree of belief in their likelihood are assumed to be separable tasks, the results of which can then be combined to determine the preferred alternative. Evidence from different areas of psychology now provides a growing consensus that this assumption is too simplistic. Observed dependencies in the evaluation of uncertain outcomes and the likelihood of the events giving rise to them are frequent and systematic. Dependencies seem to derive from general strategic processes that take into consideration asymmetric costs of over- vs. underestimates of uncertain quantities. This asymmetric-loss-function interpretation provides a psychological explanation for observed judgments and decisions under uncertainty and links them to other judgment tasks. The decision weights estimated when applying dependent-utility models to choices are not simply reflections of perceived subjective probability but a response to several constraints, all of which modify the weight of risky or uncertain outcomes.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We studied how evaluation of changes in low-probability risks are affected by reference points and framing effects. Subjects considered hypothetical situations with one or two low-probability risks. Different frames were used to describe changes in risk levels. In the first experiment, subjects chose between risk-reduction options that achieved the same overall risk reduction: large reduction of one risk vs. equal (smaller) reduction of two risks. When the risks were described as losses relative to the no-risk ideal, more subjects were indifferent between the options than when the same options were described as gains relative to the status quo. In the latter case subjects preferred equal reduction of both risks, unless one risk could be reduced to zero. In a related experiment, subjects were less willing to pay any price for a commodity that carried small increases in two risks than for a commodity carrying a comparable large increase in one risk. In other experiments, subjects evaluated single changes in risks rather than comparing or evaluating pairs of changes. Subjects again placed particularly high value on reducing any risks to zero, and they were even more inclined to do so when some other risk would also be reduced to zero. In a final experiment, elimination of risk was found to be less highly valued if its source was not fully eliminated, and a status-quo effect was found. The findings are interpreted in terms of reference theories of choice. © 1993 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although flawed by methodological problems, the research literature tends to provide support for the assumption that induced abortion in the 1st trimester is not accompanied by enduring negative psychological sequelae. In cases where such sequelae are reported, the morbidity is attributed to a pre-existing psychiatric condition or circumstances precipitating the choice of abortion. However, detailed descriptive letters from 45 women prepared in response to a request by a pastor of an upper-middle-class Protestant congregation in Florida indicate that prolonged grieving after abortion may be more widespread phenomenon than previously believed. Letter writers ranged in age from 25-60 years; 75% were unmarried at the time of the procedure and 29% aborted before the legalization of abortion in the US. The most frequently cited long-term sequela, especially among those who felt coerced to abort, was a continued feeling of guilt. Fantasies about the aborted fetus was the next most frequently mentioned experience. Half of the letter writers referred to their abortions, as \"murder\" and 44% voiced regret about their decision to abort. Other long-term effects included depression (44%), feelings of loss (31%), shame (27%), and phobic responses to infants (13%). For 42% of these women, the adverse psychological effects of abortion endured over 10 years. Since letter-writers came from a self-selected population group with a known bias against abortion and only negative experiences were solicited, these experiences must be regarded as subjectives and anecdotal. However, they draw attention to the need for methodologically sound studies of a possible prolonged grief syndrome among a small percentage of women who have abortions, especially when coercion is involved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: We conducted a multicenter trial comparing two angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors to determine whether effects on quality of life during antihypertensive therapy are uniform within this pharmacologic class of agents, and to relate the effects of the drugs on quality of life to objective adverse events, such as the loss of a job or the death of a spouse. Methods: After a four-week washout period when they received placebo, 379 men with mild-to-moderately-severe hypertension were randomly assigned to receive captopril (25 to 50 mg twice daily, with or without hydrochlorothiazide) or enalapril (5 to 20 mg per day, with or without hydrochlorothiazide) for 24 weeks. Blood pressure, quality of life, and life events were monitored. Differences between treatments were evaluated by calibrating measures of quality of life with objective life events. Results: Throughout the treatment period, no differences were found in blood pressure, frequency of withdrawal of patients from the study, or major side effects. Patients treated with captopril had more favorable changes in overall quality of life, general perceived health, vitality, health status, sleep, and emotional control (P<0.05 for each). The changes varied according to the quality of life at base line (P<0.001); patients with a low quality of life at base line remained stable or improved with either drug, whereas those with a higher quality of life remained stable with captopril but worsened with enalapril. The quality-of-life scales correlated with life events and symptom distress (P<0.001), and calibration analysis indicated that differences between treatments were clinically important. Conclusions: Two angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, indistinguishable according to clinical assessments of efficacy and safety, had different effects on quality of life. Calibration with life events showed that drug-induced changes are substantial and that the different effects of these two agents on quality of life can be clinically meaningful., Quality of life is widely perceived to be an important end point in therapeutic assessment. Quality-of-life end points that are related to health are increasingly being used to adjust measures of effectiveness for clinical decision making and resource allocation1–4 and to evaluate drugs in clinical trials of cancer,5,6 human immunodeficiency virus infection,7,8 arthritis,9,10 heart failure,11,12 and hypertension13–15.

This method identifies, for each model, the situations that permit consistent inferences about the ordering of value differences. Examples of rankdependent and sign-dependent preference patterns are used to motivate the models and the \"tradeoff consistency\" axioms that characterize them.

      "Abstract: This exploratory study was undertaken to assess the effects of legalized gambling in a northeastern Minnesota community and to inform the state's citizens and decision makers of the impacts of gambling. The community, the types of gambling available, and the types of businesses and organizations involved in gambling are described. Annual (1990) amounts of money won and lost, profit margins for various types of gambling, and the resulting economic and social community impacts are discussed. The most consequential findings are the amounts of money spent on gambling (twice the state's per capita average) and the resulting community revenue losses (nearly $2 million or $105 per person) annually. Nevertheless, many local citizens want even more gambling opportunities. Public policy and future research issues are raised. © 1993 Human Sciences Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study of coping with unemployment traces the distress levels of workers in 4 closing and 12 nonclosing General Motors (GM) plants. Workers were interviewed 3 months before plants closed, 1 year after, and 2 years after (final N = 1,136). Tested were (a) effects of unemployment on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and somatization; (b) linkages between depression and subsequent unemployment, controlling for workers' gender, race, marital status, age, education, prior income, and seniority; and (c) the relationship between workers' coping decisions and subsequent depression. Results showed that unemployment at Waves 2 and 3 was related to prior frequency of symptoms of depression. Depression, in turn, was alleviated for workers whose coping decisions at Wave 2 fit with their Wave 3 outcomes: those who both wanted and found a job, lost a job they disliked, or remained unemployed as planned.\u001b[0m :\n",

People sometimes treat safety and danger categorically, undervalue the importance of a partial risk reduction, are influenced by the way in which a problem is framed, and inappropriately evaluate an action by its subsequent outcome. These strategies help explain examples where risk perceptions conflict with standard scientific analyses. In the domain of emotions, people tend to consider losses as more significant than the corresponding gains, are imperfect at predicting future preferences, distort their memories of past personal experiences, have difficulty resolving inconsistencies between emotions and rationality, and worry with an intensity disproportionate to the actual danger. In general, such intangible aspects of clinical care have received little attention in the medical literature. —We suggest that an awareness of how people reason is an important clinical skill that can be promoted by knowledge of selected past studies in psychology.

      "Abstract: ■ Purpose: To critically review the risks and benefits of therapy for asymptomatic and symptomatic persons with gallstones who are considering therapy to prevent future episodes of biliary pain or complications including acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or gallbladder cancer. ■ Data Sources: Review of English-language literature regarding the natural history of persons with gallstones and the operative mortality rates for open cholecystectomy and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mathematical simulation modeling was used to derive estimates of lifetime risks for gallstone-related mortality and for life expectancy, for prophylactic cholecystectomy and expectant management, for men and women of different ages. ■ Results: For persons with asymptomatic gallstones, natural history is so benign that treatment is generally not recommended. For persons with symptomatic gallstones, (that is, that have caused an episode of biliary pain), the rate for subsequent pain is high so that many persons probably choose cholecystectomy to avoid pain; however, about 30% of persons who have had pain do not have further episodes of pain. The expected loss of life for persons with symptomatic stones managed expectantly is roughly several months, on average, and may not be considered high enough in itself to warrant therapy. Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy has become popular with patients and physicians, its safety is yet unknown compared with open cholecystectomy. ■ Conclusion: Prophylactic cholecystectomy should be recommended for most persons with symptomatic gallstones unless the person wants to try a period of watchful waiting to see if pain recurs. Nonsurgical therapy may be suitable for persons with high operative risk. For persons with asymptomatic gallstones, watchful waiting is the best course.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A natural setting in which 158 coal miners who had filed grievances were assigned to either mediation or arbitration was used to test a model of 3 mediating processes underlying judgments of procedural justice: instrumental, noninstrumental, and procedural enactment. The generality of these processes was tested across procedures varying objectively in the degree of disputants' outcome control, across contexts in which disputes rather than decisions were resolved, and across situations in which the grievance was won, lost, or compromised as a result of the dispute resolution procedure. All 3 processes consistently accounted for judgments of procedural justice in all but 1 of these circumstances (instrumental processes did not account for procedural justice when grievants won). Perceptions of the 3rd party's enactment of the procedure emerged in this study as a key influence (as a moderator and mediator) of procedural justice judgments. Implications for the theory of procedural justice and the design of dispute resolution procedures are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Summary   A 1991 phenomenological case‐study investigated the effect of long‐term gastrostomy tube feeding on an incompetent patient and her surrogate decision maker. In this case, a daughter chose tube feeding for her severely debilitated mother after she had become aphasic. The report includes the daughter's perceptions of (a) her relationship and experience with a tube‐fed mother, and (b) her mother's experience with tube feeding. The experience of tube feeding differed from what the daughter had expected. The daughter perceived that tube feeding reduced her mother's quality of life. Taste sensations and pleasures of eating were lost. Tube feeding also negatively influenced the daughter's activities and subsequent relationship with her mother. Tube feeding, however, did extend life and did allow ongoing visits by the daughter and her children. The mother could still continue to fulfil the role of a mother and grandmother to a certain extent. Most significantly, however, tube feeding was perceived to prolong death. Concern over whether her mother would have chosen tube feeding for herself prevailed. Copyright © 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A descriptive model of choice between monetary lotteries-called the Advantage Model of Choice-is proposed. According to the model, people evaluate lotteries in a choice problem by comparing them separately on the dimension of gains and on the dimension of losses. In making these comparisons, people employ both “absolute” and “comparative” strategies that are subsequently combined to yield a choice. The model is evaluated on both qualitative and quantitative grounds. As part of the qualitative evaluation, a number of previously documented phenomena that characterize people′s choices between lotteries are reviewed. It is shown that the Advantage Model is consistent with these phenomena. As part of the quantitative evaluation, three experimental tests of the model are reported. The model′s ability to predict both individual choice and group preference is evaluated, and the model is shown to compare favorably to particular versions of Prospect Theory and Utility Theory. It is suggested that the Advantage Model captures one of the underlying processes that guide human choice behavior in risky situations. Examples of the model′s relevance to nonmonetary domains are provided. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

A static-risk computer spreadsheet model was built to assess the risks of herd infection together with the likely disease effects and associated costs to the producer following initial infection of the herd. A dynamic state-transition disease model was built which was able to model the spread of infection in a herd over time (i.e. endemic disease) together with the likely disease losses and costs involved. The models help to explore the nature of the disease and its effects and costs to producers over time, to explore control strategies and their likely impact, and to help highlight areas critical to disease control decision-making. © 1993.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper uses Regret Theory to explain some survey results on managers' dividend policy decisions under uncertainty. Regret Theory suggests that when an individual chooses an action from a number of uncertain alternatives, his decision is influenced by the potential post‐decision regret (pride) he feels on his inabilty (ability) to select the option with the best outcome. Based on this premise, we argue that (1) the decision to pay dividends and simultaneously raise venture capital from external sources is attributable to managerial aversion for regret at the failure of a risky investment opportunity implemented with internal funds generated by a conservative dividend policy; and (2) the decision to support dividends with borrowed funds when earnings are declining is motivated by the prospect that an improvement in the firm's financial condition will make the managers proud that their judgment has helped avert a potential crisis for the firm without any wealth loss to its shareholders.

      "Abstract: Recent studies by Kahneman et al. (1986a, b) present consistent evidence that the economically rational decision of market exploitation is perceived as unfair by individuals. Further, these fairness judgments are influenced by the sign of the outcome—that is, an outcome coded as a gain is perceived as fairer than an objectively similar outcome coded as a loss, particularly when they occur for the benefit of the exploiter. As an extension of the Kahneman et al. research, we examine the influence of both outcome sign and information about the procedures used to allocate the outcome on individual judgements of market exploitation. Replicating Kahneman et al., we found that market exploitation is judged as unfair, and that such judgements are influences by the subjective coding (as gains or losses) of objectively similar outcomes. In addition, we found that procedural information also influences judgements of market exploitation. The implications of these results are discussed.

      "Abstract: This article examines Australian firms' voluntary reporting treatments of foreign-currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of overseas subsidiary accounts. Prior to regulation, firms could report the translation gains or losses in earnings or reserves. While leverage and management ownership proportions have some univariate explanatory power, only leverage is significant in multivariate tests of the impact of debt and management contracting incentives for the alternative reporting methods. The evidence provides weak support for predictions that firms' reporting methods were motivated by lenders' attempts to restrict wealth transfers and managers' attempts to transfer wealth from shareholders. As such, it is unclear whether contractual efficiency or opportunism dominated the reporting decisions. © 1993.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A general equilibrium model is developed in which production of a good generates toxic pollution that imposes the risk of premature mortality. This risk is reduced to an optimal level by a Pigouvian tax that causes consumers to demand less of the polluting good. Whereas the value of human life on which courtroom decisions are commonly made is one of lost output, in this model the value of human life includes both a lost output component and a psychological willingness to pay component. Because the dose-response curve for pollution is S shaped and because the disparity between the ex ante statistical value of human life and the ex post certainty value is likely to be large, the model has special implications for Pigouvian taxation. © 1993.\u001b[0m :\n",

Three different group compositions (number of members with “gain-oriented” vs “loss-oriented” frames) were used: three gain-oriented and one loss oriented (3-1), two gain-oriented and two loss-oriented (2-2), and one gain-oriented and three loss-oriented (1-3). Results indicated a postgroup discussion choice shift toward the risk alternative in the 2-2 and the 1-3 composition conditions.

      "Abstract: This paper analyzes the role of capital structure in the presence of intrafirm influence activities. The hierarchical structure of large organizations inevitably generates attempts by members to influence the distributive consequences of organizational decisions. In corporations, for example, top management can reallocate or eliminate quasi rents earned by their employees, while at the same time, they must rely on these employees to provide them with information vital to their decision making. This creates the opportunity for lower level managers to influence top management's discretionary decisions. As a result, divisional managers may attempt to inflate the corporate perception of their relative contributions to the firm, or to take actions that make the elimination of their rents more costly for the firm. This incentive to influence is especially acute when managers fear losing their jobs, for example in the event of a divestiture. Since the firm's capital structure can affect future divestiture decisions, it can be chosen to reduce or increase the divisional managers' incentives to influence top management's decisions. The control of influence activities arises at the expense of restrictions on future divestiture decisions. Hence, there emerges an optimal capital structure that trades off the costs of influence activities against the costs of making poor divestiture decisions. The findings suggest that capital structure can also be chosen to control influence activities that arise under less extreme motivations. We identify several key factors that determine the optimal capital structure: the top management's prior assessment of the likelihood that it will be optimal to divest a specific division; the costs of influence activities to the firm and to the divisional managers; and the difference in the valuation of the division's assets in the current firm and under alternative uses. 1993 The American Finance Association\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An experiment is presented that explores the finding that a request to judge probabilities can bias subsequent decisions (Erev et al., 1993). Subjects chose among gambles whose outcomes were determined by the occurrence of events in a video game environment. The probabilities of the events could be assessed based on the visual display. In the no‐probabilities condition the subjects simply indicated their choices. In the subjective‐probability condition subjects first estimated probabilities and then made choices. In the objective‐probability condition, subjects saw the actual probabilities instead of the events when making their choices. The results suggest that the availability of explicit probabilities (both subjective and objectives) decreases the subjects sensitivity to the outcome dimension and, hence, increases the reflection effect; i.e. subjects in the subjective‐and objective‐probability conditions showed stronger risk aversion when the gambles involved possible profit and stronger risk seeking when the gambles involved possible losses than in the no‐probabilities condition. In addition, the subjective assessments impaired the quality of the decisions in term of the subjects expected profit. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

      "Abstract: Summary The purpost of this research was to determine whether people devalue future heahh gains differently from future health losses. 108 subjects in various states of health were randomised to groups that rated their preference for a hypothetical health gain or loss of variable duration and delay, in the condition ofanhritis. Direction and duration of the hYPOthetical future health change had an interactive effect on time preference (p < 0.00 1). For the health gain, devaluation due to delay was consistent across durations. For the health loss, devaluation depended on duration; the long-duration loss was devalued with delay while the fleeting loss was inflated. These findings cast doubt on the assumptions of positive time preference and constant rate discounting that underlie the classical model of discounting. They provide suppon for a theory of intenemporal choice which posits that vivid, fleeting, future events engender ‘anticipation utility’ which attenuates positive time preference. OUT findings suggest that standard practices fOT discounting future health outcomes in economic evaluations of arthritis and possibly other conditions may need to be re-examined. © 1993, Adis International Limited.

Current and initial stress response to the abortion, general mental health, and demographic characteristics were assessed quantitatively, and interviews explored subjective perceptions. The distress group had significantly higher scores on initial stress response and religiosity, were more often currently affiliated with conservative churches, and reported lower degree of social support and confidence in the abortion decision. Qualitatively, 48% of the distress group recalled experiencing feelings of loss immediately post-abortion, in contrast to none in the nondistress group.

      "Abstract: Six months after the death of their infants of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the subjective impression of mothers anonymously rating their initial and present grief was that there had been a reduction in all symptoms (p <.001). However, an increase in the relative ranking of some cognitive symptoms over somatic ones, the association of certain lifestyles and situational variables with higher levels of grief, and the implication for future symptoms of family decisions made during bereavement underscore the importance of continuing active support for these families. In relative ranking, guilt rose from 10th to 5th most prominent symptom, particularly among the 34% of mothers whose infants manifested clinical symptoms (p <.05). Single mothers had higher grief scores both initially (p <.05) and at 6 months (p <.002), were almost three times more likely to become pregnant within 6 months of the death but only one-third as likely to attend a support group, and were also more likely to move after the death (44% vs 25%). Mothers whose infants had been discovered by another caregiver reached out more to a crisis intervention service of a support program available to SIDS families (p <.05). Mothers without surviving children had grief levels comparable with those with children but were less likely to rate their pediatrician's support as satisfactory, increasing the probability that they would change physicians with subsequent children, thereby losing continuity of care and support. © 1992 by Williams & Wilkins.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Adults' self‐reports about their choices in a delayed matching‐to‐sample task were studied as a function of the number of elements (one, two, or three) in a compound sample stimulus. Signal‐detection analyses were used to examine control of self‐reports by the number of sample elements, by the speed and accuracy of choices reported about, and by several events contingent on self‐reports. On each matching‐to‐sample trial, a sample element appeared as one of two comparison stimuli. Choice of the matching element, if made within 500 ms of the onset of the comparison stimuli, produced points worth money or chances in a drawing for money, depending on the subject. After each choice, subjects pressed either a “yes” or “no” button to answer a computer‐generated query about whether the choice met the point contingency. The number of sample elements in the matching‐to‐sample task varied across trials, and events contingent on self‐reports varied across experimental conditions. In Experiment 1, the conditions were defined by different combinations of feedback messages and point consequences contingent on self‐reports, but self‐reports were systematically influenced only by the sample‐stimulus manipulation. Self‐report errors increased with the number of sample elements. False alarms (inaccurate reports of success) were far more common than misses (inaccurate reports of failure), and false alarms were especially likely after choices that were correct but too slow to meet the point contingency. Sensitivity (A′) of self‐reports decreased as the number of sample elements increased. In addition, self‐reports were more sensitive to choice accuracy than to choice speed. All subjects showed a pronounced bias (B'H) for reporting successful responses, although the bias was reduced as the number of sample elements increased and successful choices became less frequent. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the failure of point contingencies to influence self‐reports in the first experiment was not due to a general ineffectiveness of the point consequences. Rates of inaccurate self‐reports decreased when they resulted in point losses and increased when they resulted in point gains. 1993 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior\u001b[0m :\n",

Psychotherapists, counselors, chaplains, etc. can be facilitators of effective communication. This study generated a list for use in discussion by asking persons who cared for individuals with terminal illnesses, critical injuries or elderly people what conditions seemed appropriate for termination or refusal of medical treatment except for pain relief. The 182 out of 204 individuals who contributed conditions showed clear agreement on terminal illnesses, brain disorders, dependence on machines for life, and other irreversible deterioration or severe loss of quality of life, lack of suitable treatment, patient's wish, and concern about the effect of the patient's condition on others. Some specified further qualifications, such as at what point during a terminal illness termination or refusal was appropriate. The list with notes could be appended to a Living Will or a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care. The notes should be updated periodically. Through use and research, the list also can be refined further.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risk analysis on disease epidemics of wheat was studied by simulations, using a weather model (based on the weather generator developed by Shen (1988, Ph.D. thesis, Beijing Agricultural University)) and a multiple disease epidemic simulation model for wheat (Dong, 1988, Ph.D. thesis, Beijing Agricultural University). Monte-Carlo simulations were used to link these two models. Expected yield losses in wheat caused by three diseases under various weather conditions combined with different initial inoculum levels could be estimated. The information about the risk of disease epidemics was primarily obtained from analysis of the frequency distribution of expected simulated yield losses. Two sets of simulations were performed to study the risk of yield loss on wheat in general. Two additional sets of simulations were run for the Beijing and Gangu districts to provide examples of risk assessment tables in specific environments. Risk assessment tables could provide decision makers with a powerful tool to manage diseases. © 1993.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of framing on group decision-making. Decisions involving risk were posed in terms of either gains or losses to individual subjects. Subsequently, subjects were divided into groups and the decisions were presented again in either the same frame or the opposite frame. As hypothesized, when the same frame was presented to subjects both individually and in groups, individual-level framing effects became larger in groups; when the opposite frame was presented to groups, initial framing effects were reduced. However, these results were observed on only two of the four decision cases. On the other two cases, significant choice shifts occurred independently of the framing manipulations. Implications of these results for decision making groups in applied settings are discussed. © 1993 Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of this study was to investigate the differential effects of maternal, single surrogate, and multiple surrogate caregiving on psychological and educational outcomes in a group of Vietnamese Amerasians. Subjects were assessed in Vietnam using several measures of affective and behavioral symptomatology as well as a detailed psychosocial history. Amerasians who lived continuously with their biological mothers had fewer symptoms of psychological distress than did either group raised by surrogate caregivers. In addition, those living continuously with either their mothers or a single surrogate had better educational outcomes and experienced fewer geographic relocations than did those raised by multiple surrogates. Amerasians who remained continuously with their biological mothers had better overall outcomes than did those raised by surrogate caregivers. Continuous surrogate caregiving appeared to offer some, but not complete, protection from the adverse effects of maternal loss. The clinical significance of these findings for those assessing and treating Amerasians, as well as for those assisting immigration officials with relocation decisions, is discussed. J. Am. Acad.

      "Abstract: The contributions in the April issue of the Canadian journal of Behavioural Science on \"The Psychology of Control\" suggest both how much we have learned in the past twenty years and how far we still have to go. Although it is difficult to mark the beginning of any field, Glass and Singer (1972) set the stage by distinguishing between \"actual\" and \"perceived\" control. Many of us subsequently investigated the negative consequences of the loss of perceived control (Dweck and Repucci, 1973; Seligman, 1975; Wortman and Brehm, 1975) and the positive consequences of gaining perceived control (Langer, 1975; Langer and Rodin, 1976; Bandura and Cervone, 1983). Unfortunately, when we identified perceived control as a variable with important consequences, we failed to distinguish between the perspectives of the actor exercising control and the observer witnessing that behaviour. Most researchers adopted the observer's perspective, which prompted us to label perceived control an \"illusion\" (Langer, 1975). We discovered that subjects had a misplaced confidence in their own capacity to control events (Langer and Roth, 1975; Ayeroff and Abelson, 1976). More recently, the observer's perspective has prompted some investigators (Taylor and Brown, 1988) to assert that illusory control is good and even necessary for psychological well-being, while others (Wong, 1992) question whether sufficient attention has been given to the aversive consequences of control. We doubt that an illusion of control is beneficial. Rather than accepting perceived control as an illusion, we prefer to reassess the validity of the current theories of control. Would perceived control still appear illusory if we took the actor's perspective seriously? We focus on this question by examining a situation that embodies the entire spectrum of perceived control ranging from extreme helplessness to extreme domination. We consider sexual trauma from the perspective of the victim. From the actor's perspective, we make an important distinction between choice and prediction. This distinction allows us to recognize that, even in situations of apparent helplessness, perceived control may be legitimate from the actor's perspective. From this perspective, we can see that current theoretical frameworks on control may have distorted the actor's reality. We conclude that future research on perceived control should be guided by the actor's perspective. © 2014 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The term \"framing effect\" refers to the finding that subjects often respond differently to different descriptions of the same problem. An important question about framing effects is whether subjects can recognize the equivalence of the two problems if asked to directly compare them. In two experiments, subjects were first presented with framing problems and then were asked to directly compare the two versions and state whether they thought these should be treated the same. In Experiment 1, subjects gave brief justifications for their answers. They often provided sensible justifications for why the two situations should be treated differently. Experiment 2 showed that different types of framing effects (e.g., loss/gain, sunk cost) varied with respect to whether subjects agreed that the two versions should be treated the same. These results have implications for both normative and descriptive models of decision making. © 1993 by Academic Press, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The dominance principle states that the judged price of gamble A should be equal to or greater than the judged price of gamble B whenever A's outcomes are equal to or better than the corresponding outcomes of B, holding everything else constant. Subjects often violate the dominance principle by assigning a higher price to a gamble with some probability of winning a positive amount, Y, otherwise zero, than to a superior gamble with the same chances of winning Y, otherwise winning X. Violations also occur with losses. Results are consistent with a configural-weight theory in which the decision weight for each outcome depends on the rank of the outcome with respect to the other outcomes in the lottery and the value of the outcome (zero vs. nonzero). © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We develop a new version of prospect theory that employs cumulative rather than separable decision weights and extends the theory in several respects. This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability. This article has benefited from discussions with Colin Camerer, Chew Soo-Hong, David Freedman, and David H. Krantz. We are especially grateful to Peter P. Wakker for his invaluable input and contribution to the axiomatic analysis. We are indebted to Richard Gonzalez and Amy Hayes for running the experiment and analyzing the data.

      "Abstract: Among the violations of expected utility (E.U.) theory which have been observed by experimenters, the violations of its independence axiom is, by far, the most common. It seems that, in many cases, these inconsistencies can be ascribed to the desire for security - called the security factor by L. Lopes (1986) - which \"makes people attach special importance to the worst outcomes of risky decisions\" as well as to the sole outcomes of riskless decisions (certainty effect). J.-Y. Jaffray (1988) has proposed a model which generalizes E.U. theory by taking into account this factor and is then able to account for certain violations. However, especially in experiments on choice involving prospective losses, violations of the von Neumann-Morgenstern independence axiom cannot be explained by the security factor alone and have to be partially ascribed to the potential factor (L. Lopes, 1986) which \"reflects heightened attention to the best outcomes of decisions\", especially when the best outcome is the status quo. In this paper, we construct an axiomatic model for subjects taking into account simultaneously or alternatively the security factor and the potential factor. For this, as in Jaffray's model, it has been necessary to weaken not only the standard independence axiom but also the continuity axiom and, in the same time, to reinforce the dominance axiom. In the resulting model, choices are partially determined by the mere comparison of the (security level, potential level) (i.e. the (worst outcome, best outcome)) pairs offered, and completed by the maximization of an affine function of the expected utility, the coefficients of which depend on both the security level and potential level. In this model, a decision maker who (i) has constant marginal utility for money, (ii) is sensitive to the security factor alone in the domain of gains, (iii) is sensitive to the potential factor alone in the domain of losses, behaves as a risk averter for gains and a risk seeker for losses. © 1992 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper elaborates upon the linguistic implications of results centred around prospect theory, a decision-theoretic framework that so far has been applied in psychology, economics, political science and sociology. One of the goals of prospect theory has been to account for cases where the reformation to decision-theoretic options (expressible as “gains” or “losses”) altered the preference order of individuals. Framing effects of this kind are entwined with a number of linguistic issues that are the topic of this paper relative to the domain under discussion: the granularity of meaning (including the status of thematic roles and the foreground/background distinction); the role of reference points; the relationship of semantic and conceptual structure; and information packaging. The paper also looks at the interface between the semantics of verbs related to “winning” and ‘losing” and the pragmatic principles of prospect theory. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

      "Abstract: It is estimated that approximately 3% of pregnant adolescents who carry to term will place their infant for adoption. Birth mothers who place for adoption have higher socioeconomic indices and are less influenced by a negative social network than are those who keep the child. As a result of placing an infant, birth mothers may experience an enduring sense of loss. This is exacerbated by the social blocking of open grieving and restricted opportunities to participate, even indirectly, in the life of the child. If adoption is to become a more frequently used pregnancy resolution option, then structural changes in the delivery of counseling and supportive services must be considered. 1992 The Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Most utilitarian theories assume that people are rational and tend to favor activities which maximize profits and minimize losses. Hence, when the gains associated with illegal behavior outweigh the costs, the volume of crime is expected to increase. Most macro-social research based on this perspective examines the effects of only one piece of information that informs the decision to violate the law, namely the probability of experiencing negative sanctions. To the extent that prospective offenders simultaneously consider both the gains and losses associated with selecting a particular course of action, the failure to take into account gains accrued from illegal activities in analyses of criminal behavior is likely to produce an omitted variable bias. Moreover, utilitarian theories of crime specifically discuss the effects of the gains from crime relative to costs. Hence, properly specified models should include cost-benefit functions. The present study seeks to extend previous macro-social research by examining the influence of the relative costs and benefits of engaging in illegal behavior on the volume of economic crime (i.e., robbery, burglary, larceny, and auto theft). The time-series analyses indicate that as the pecuniary gains from crime increase relative to the risks of apprehension, the aggregate levels of auto theft, robbery, and burglary increase. However, the gains from crime relative to risks are not related to the level of larceny-theft. The implications of these findings for utilitarian theories of crime control are discussed. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Sufficient conditions for the existence of optimal incentive strategy are given. Static and dynamic leader-follower games with quadratic cost functionals are investigated. It is shown that leader-follower games with quadratic cost functionals admit optimal incentive strategies under some conditions. For a special class of leader-follower games with the follower’s decision variable being scalar, there exists a unique linear optimal incentive strategy.

The task for the first study was to judge the maximum worth of information by bidding to reduce an ambiguous prospect to a risky one when given an option between a risky prospect and an ambiguous one. A within-subjects design was used in which, for the risky prospect, the probability of gain and expected value were varied. The results were inconsistent with both expected value and expected utility models, but were consistent with a satisficing strategy. The second study was similar to the first but with context changes in the stimuli and a slightly different decision task. The results showed that the effects are robust across task and context. The main behavioral effect is that people appear more willing to buy information that may decrease an expected loss than information that may increase an expected gain. A decision justification principle is consistent with that effect. © 1992.\u001b[0m :\n",

But whether the costs to consumers of imperfect information are large enough to warrant public intervention in markets is still an open question. By studying the optimality of new car choices, we attempt to shed light on this question in this study. We use individual-level preference data to rank the alternatives in each respondent's choice set on the basis of quality. Defining a non-optimal choice as one in which the consumer could have purchased a brand of higher estimated quality for a lower price than the actual choice, we estimate the cost savings that would have resulted from buying the higher quality brand at the lower price. We go on to relate these estimated losses due to non-optimal choices to brands purchased and to consumer characteristics. © 1992.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: I believe the choice of DM2.95 as a central rate for sterling's entry into the ERM was a major mistake of macroeconomic policy, on a par with monetary targeting and underestimatingtlle late 1980s' consumer‐led boom. Indeed it was a belief that we were about to make this mistake that led me to undertake, with colleagues at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a detailed and unique study of the choice facing policy makers. I shall have more to say on that study below. Shortly after entry I wrote: “The danger is that the government will attempt to defend the present exchange rate bands at all costs. As a result it may produce, or fail to prevent, a recession on the same scale as 1980‐81. (Wren‐Lewis, 1990, emphasis added). I fear that much of this has come to pass, but we still have a chance to retrieve something. To propose a devaluation of sterling within the ERM requires three distinct arguments. The first is that we entered the ERM at a real exchange rate which was above a level required to produce a sustainable current account of the balance of payments. The second is that this matters, and in particular that it has prevented the government from taking steps to counteract the recession. The third is that the gains in adjusting, through a realignment, to a lower rate now outweigh the loss of credibility that would be involved. I shall consider each point in turn.1 Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

Evidence supports the hypothesis that the methods of accounting for foreign‐currency gains and losses on long‐term monetary‐items were associated with the exposure. Methods of disposing of the gains and losses arising from translation of the accounts of overseas subsidiaries were also associated with the exposure, but not in the manner predicted. The results indicate that foreign‐currency accounting policies were established in an interactive (portfolio) decision‐making process, and that managers reported equity claim exposures relative to the returns to equity claims against other firms. Overall, the study provides evidence that at least some unregulated choices of foreign‐currency accounting methods were made to minimise the agency costs associated with contracts between shareholders and management. © 1992 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand\u001b[0m :\n",

Least strong client reactions were nihilistic flight, regression, denial, recapitulation, and expression of a need for further treatment. Practitioners’ strongest reactions to termination were pride in the client’s success and pride in their own skill; their least strong reactions were relief, doubt about their own effectiveness, doubt about their client’s progress, and reexperiencing of previous losses.

      "Abstract: Decision‐makers in the protected crop environment face similar pest‐management decisions, in economic terms, to growers of field crops or grain store managers. As a result, the principles of economic thresholds, cost: benefit analyses and risk minimisation apply equally to each of these systems. Growers are faced with several general classes of pest‐control decisions: the general control strategy to adopt, and then tactical questions such as when to start control and when to stop or change control practices. However, there are a number of aspects of protected crops which require a somewhat different view of the problem. Several economic models for these questions are examined. The high density of protected crops means that a great deal is at risk at any one time. The protected environment reduces uncertainty about losses, but by optimising temperatures and humidities it increases the probability of loss. The feeling of being able to “control” the environment may extend to pests as well, increasing the use of standard pesticide or biocontrol programmes, rather than responsive pest management based on thresholds. The relatively small scale of protected crops, their accessibility for inspection and the high level of management skills involved in their production improve prospects for monitoring and predicting crop levels, insects and diseases, thus reducing uncertainty. However, the high probability of loss may reduce the value of gathering information, and encourage growers to rely on standard prophylactic procedures which allow them to devote management effort to more productive activities, such as marketing. The balance may be shifted towards more information‐based decisions in the future to try to avoid excessive pesticide use because of more stringent regulations on pesticide residues and changing market demand for more organic produce. This may affect disease control in particular, where prophylactic biological control is not an option. At the policy level, feedback on environmental impacts to consumers and policy‐makers is poor and decisions with expensive implications for the economy and for environmental quality may not be made in an optimal manner.

      "Abstract: The article presents the results of some empirical studies of perceptions of ownership changes in Poland in 1988 and 1990. A fundamental difference in employee awareness appears in relating ownership to responsibility, financial risk and effective management. The negative outcomes of privatization are: unemployment, loss of social security benefits, and takeover or partial takeover of property by foreign capital. The positive aspects of the changes are: increasing efficiency throughout the economy, the rationalization of management, a relationship between the effects of work and wages, and a reduction in bureaucracy. In conclusion it is noted that the process of ownership change is becoming politicized, and the relationship between privatization and changes in social awareness is emphasized. © 1992.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The effect of positive versus negative frames on risky choice was examined for a variety of scenarios and risks. Preferences in the positive domain were strong and mainly risk averse, with notable exceptions. Preferences in the negative domain, however, were marked by their inconsistency, shown both by an overwhelming lack of significant majority preferences and a surprisingly strong tendency of individual subjects to vacillate in their negatively framed choices across presentations. This finding is accounted for by a proposed aspiration level contingency in which aspiration levels are systematically set to be more difficult to achieve in the face of a perceived loss than a gain. The implications of the results, and the aspiration level contingency, are explored with respect to current theories of risky choice, including Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) prospect theory and Lopes's (1987, 1990) security-potential/aspiration theory.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigated the extent to which decisions by coaches and athletic trainers concerning the return of injured athletes to competition were influenced by the player's status and the game situation. Samples were drawn from Oregon high school and Canadian university basketball teams. Coaches and athletic trainers completed a questionnaire in which they decided whether an injured player should be returned to competition. The scenarios included winning, losing, or close games and involved a starter, first substitute, or bench player. Chi-square analyses revealed that coaches made decisions based on both a player's status and the game situation. In contrast, athletic trainers' decisions were not significantly influenced by these variables. Since the role of the coach seemingly makes it difficult to make health related decisions concerning injured players, athletic trainers should be responsible for such decisions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Study objective-The aim was to carry out an economic evaluation of the programme implemented in one district health authority for the screening of infants for hearing loss. Design-The approach taken was a cost-effectiveness analysis using the methodology of decision analysis to model the options appraised: (1) the conventional screening policy was for a health visitor and colleague to screen at 8-9 months, and at 10 months for each child to be seen again by a clinical medical officer for a developmental assessment plus hearing screen if necessary; (2) the alternative policy was for screening to take place at 10 months only if concern is expressed (or if there is a clinical indication) at the developmental assessment; the introduction of a 'clue list' was considered; (3) the third option was no screening. Main results-The annual expected cost per unit output was £20.57 for the conventional screening policy, between £11.13 and £11.23 for the alternative policy, and £11.27 for the third option of no screening. Introducing the 'clue list' under the alternative screening policy is likely to raise the cost per unit output, but the effects are uncertain. Conclusions-The results suggest that the alternative screening policy is more cost-effective than the conventional policy, but has little advantage over not screening at all. The effects of introducing a clue list need further investigation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Three experiments (N = 1,331) demonstrated that research findings on suspiciousness about coincidences (Miller, Turnbull, & McFarland, 1989) can be accounted for in terms of subjective probability, as predicted by cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST) but in contrast with the norm theory (NT) account offered by Miller et al. (1989). Ss participated in a hypothetical (Experiments 1 and 2) or real (Experiment 3) lottery game in which they chose between 2 bowls offering equivalent probabilities of winning or losing but differing with respect to absolute numbers (e.g., 1 in 10 vs. 10 in 100). Responses across 4 conditions (2 probability levels × 2 outcome types) and across the 3 experiments supported predictions derived from CEST but not those derived from NT. Results are discussed in terms of 2 conceptual systems, rational and experiential, that operate by different rules of inference.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Relocation to a nursing home can be stressful and may result in mental and physical illness. Appraisal, or the meaning assigned to relocation, can influence relocation outcome. This study examined the relationships between appraisal of relocation and 30 nursing home residents' psychological and physical health, morale, functional independence, and demographic and situational factors, including age, gender, income, education, prior residence, participation in the decision to relocate, and preparation for the move. Positive, benign, and challenge appraisals were related to higher morale and functional independence. Threat appraisal was related to poorer psychological health and lower morale. Harm-loss appraisal was associated with lower morale and lower functional independence. Preparation for the move was related to higher positive appraisal, higher morale, functional independence, and lower harm-loss scores. Implications include the need to assess people's appraisal of relocation so as to plan strategies that prevent relocation stress. © 1992 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.\u001b[0m :\n",

The paper reports research on the cost-effectiveness of the malaria control programme in Nepal. It outlines the heirarchy of choices presented by malaria control and concentrates on the evaluation of the mix of routine strategies employed by the programme, particularly for vector control and case detection and treatment. A social perspective is taken, and emphasis placed on identifying costs falling on households, namely private expenditure on treatment and loss of days of work.

      "Abstract: Images of AIDS invoke fears of contagion, disability and formidable death, and moral overtones directed toward drug use, sexuality and sexual identity and freedom. Responses to these images are both private and public, and have profound consequences for individuals whose lives have been touched by the disease, both the person with AIDS and the family caregiver. The purpose of this paper is to analyze in detail 'going public,' one category of a substantive theory of AIDS family caregiving. This category was developed from a grounded theory study of 53 AIDS family members who were asked to describe their experiences as an AIDS family caregiver during an indepth interview. Data were content analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Going public referred to how AIDS family caregivers let others know that they were caring for a PWA. Specifically, going public entailed selecting appropriate persons and audiences to tell, formulating approaches to communicating information, and considering the risks and benefits of the possible choices. The description of going public as an AIDS family caregiver details the assertiveness involved in political action and social change, contrasted with the isolation and secrecy involved in maintaining relationships with others under the condition of a stigmatizing illness. Data revealed a particular emphasis on the phenomenon of 'guilt by association'. Because of their close relationship to a person with AIDS, caregivers were obligated to share the stigma of AIDS and were likewise discredited. Findings from our study emphasize the tremendous personal suffering experienced by caregivers which was associated with AIDS stigma in the form of rejection, loss of friends and harassment. Data also revealed the strong commitment of many caregivers to social activism which ranged from participating in educational efforts to marching in demonstrations. The rationale for the apparent increased activism among AIDS family caregivers compared to other groups of caregivers is explored. Going public highlights both the personal suffering and social manifestations of AIDS, significant issues to consider in planning health services for the second decade of the AIDS epidemic. © 1992.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The paper examines the issue of whether willingness to pay (WTP) or willingness to accept (WTA) is the most appropriate indicator of the benefits or costs that people realize from a change in an environmental asset. Specifically, the paper addresses the disparity between estimates obtained in contingent valuation research with these different measures, and it suggests a reason for the disparity that requires an expanded model of valuation. The model focuses on the context in which valuation decisions are made, accounting for the role of change position (gain or loss) and motives like personal responsibility and altruism in influencing resource values. The paper also calls for an expanded inductive approach to researching the issues raised by the model. It reports some initial results from inductive research that suggest that WTP is the most appropriate indicator, but the paper calls for further research that addresses the issues this finding raises. © 1992.\u001b[0m :\n",

A total of 778 men and women, recruited from four worksites, answered a 40-item questionnaire consisting of statements based on constructs from the trans-theoretical model of behavior change. Principal-components analysis identified two factors--one a 6-item component representing avoidance of exercise (Cons), the other a 10-item component representing positive perceptions of exercise (Pros). Analysis of variance showed that the Pros, Cons, and a Decisional Balance measure (Pros minus Cons) were significantly associated with stage of exercise adoption. Results are consistent with applications of the model to smoking cessation and other areas of behavior change. Distinctions between exercise adoption and behaviors such as smoking cessation, weight loss, and alcoholism are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risk management is an important function to the service business that continues to grow in breadth and complexity. It involves the systematic application of a five-step process which is designed to enable a risk manager to cope with the risks of pure loss exposures. A number of operational and financing techniques can be employed to treat risks of loss once they have been identified. The particular technique(s) chosen by a service firm depends to a significant degree upon the firm’s objectives in relation to each of six performance dimensions. While the concept of risk management follows a patterned thought process and can be readily understood, it is helpful to select risk management techniques on the basis of relatively sophisticated decision theory formulations. Assistance in identifying, analysing, and treating loss exposures may be sought from outside experts. Too often, top management and boards of directors do not realise the value and necessity of an effective risk management programme in minimising the adverse impact of risk on the service firm's resources and earnings. A sound risk management programme enables a service business to minimise expenses, operate more effectively, and achieve some combination of pre-loss and post-loss objectives. Such a programme can make it possible for the service firm to survive an otherwise crippling financial loss and sustain service continuity. Sound risk management also engenders peace of mind and confidence while enabling owners to concentrate more of their attention on speculative risks which they might otherwise seek to avoid. For these reasons, it is increasingly crucial that service firm managers learn to manage pure risks effectively. © 1991, MCB\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A rational statistical decision maker whose preferences satisfy Savage's axioms will minimize a Bayesian risk function: the expectation with respect to a revealed (or subjective) probability distribution of a loss (or negative utility) function over the consequences of the statistical decision problem. However, the nice expected utility form of the Bayesian risk criterion is nothing but a representation of special preferences. The subjective probability is defined together with the utility (or loss) function and it is not possible, in general, to use a given loss function - say a quadratic loss - and to elicit independently a subjective distribution. I construct the Bayesian risk criterion with a set of five axioms, each with a simple mathematical implication. This construction clearly shows that the subjective probability that is revealed by a decider's preferences is nothing but a (Radon) measure equivalent to a linear functional (the criterion). The functions on which the criterion operates are expected utilities in the von Neumann-Morgenstern sense. It then becomes clear that the subjective distribution cannot be elicited a priori, independently of the utility function on consequences. However, if one considers a statistical decision problem by itself, losses, defined by a given loss function, become the consequences of the decisions. It can be imagined that experienced statisticians are used to dealing with different losses and are able to compare them (i.e. have 'preferences', or 'fears' over a set of possible losses). Using suitable axioms over these preferences, one can represent them by a (linear) criterion: this criterion is the expectation of losses with respect to a (revealed) distribution. It must be noted that such a distribution is a measure and need not be a probability distribution. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

We extended earlier research by including a wider range of variables than earlier studies and by measuring actual relocation decisions rather than willingness to relocate. Results indicated that employees who had lived a shorter time in the community and had more positive perceptions of the new job's attributes were more likely to relocate. Contrary to expectations, employees with high school age children living at home were more likely to relocate than families without high school age children. The results were compared with findings from earlier studies, and areas for future research were discussed. © 1992.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Abstract: The appeal of expected utility theory as a basis for a descriptive model of risky decision making has diminished as a result of empirical evidence which suggests that individuals do not behave in a manner consistent with the prescriptive tenets of EUT. In this paper, we explore the influence of probability on risky choice, by proposing and estimating a parametric model of risky decision making. Our results suggest that models which provide for probability transformations are most appropriate for the majority of subjects. Further, we find that the transformation differs for most subjects depending upon whether the risky outcomes are gains or losses. Most subjects are considerably less sensitive to changes in mid-range probability than is proposed by the expected utility model and risk-seeking behavior over 'long-shot' odds is common. © 1992 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

      "Abstract: This study assesses the impact of decision framing and the anticipated behavior of others on choosing to cooperate in social dilemma problems. Two hundred and eighty-eight students completed a questionnaire which presented two management scenarios representative of social dilemmas a manager might confront in a business environment. The two scenarios were based on parameters established by a generalized uniform N-person dilemma game. One scenario was described in a give-some context (contribute to the collective good); the other was presented in a take-some context (destruction of an existing collective good). After each scenario, information was presented concerning the response proportion of others, the certainty of the others' response, and whether others were expected to cooperate or defect. All four main effects were significant, as well as the interactions of response proportions by game context and response certainty by response direction. Reliable framing effects were evidenced. Individuals were more willing to contribute to a collective good than to experience some personal loss to avoid the destruction of an existing collective good. Findings raise questions concerning the extent of applicability of prospect theory to social dilemmas. © 1991, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Uncertainty may be categorized along two dimensions: (1) the nature of probabilistic information (i.e. frequency information, about the outcomes of similar situations in the past, versus process information, about the way(s) in which a future loss might occur), and (2) the degree of personal control (i.e. the extent to which an activity's outcomes depend on internal factors (e.g. knowledge, skills) versus external (e.g. chance) factors). The effects of variations in both dimensions on people's risk‐taking tendency were experimentally studied. In a computerized task, subjects had to stop a fast‐moving symbol before it passed a target line. Success yielded a financial gain, failure led them into a ‘penalty task’ with the possibility of a considerable loss. On each trial subjects chose among 10 risk levels (varying symbol speeds): low levels resulted in small but almost sure gains, high levels yielded larger but less probable gains. Across subgroups of subjects, three penalty task characteristics were varied: (1) the actual loss probability, (2) the external versus internal determination of outcomes, and (3) the available risk information. Major findings were: (a) subjects did not set a lower risk level, but they did appear to be more attentive (i.e. they failed fewer trials) when the actual loss probability was lower; (b) internal outcome determination resulted in more failed trials (lesser caution); (c) subjects ignored frequency information, but were sensitive to process information. Results are discussed in terms of effort allocation for controlling risk during task performance. Copyright © 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper discusses a model to predict intended condom use among a sample of British, 16‐20 year old virgins (n = 571). This group are of interest as they hold attitudes and have beliefs about condoms and their ability to use them that are not based upon experience of condom use. In particular the paper focuses upon intentions to use condoms despite the possible disadvantages that condoms are perceived by some to have (e.g. lost spontaneity, the need to carry them etc.). The resulting model suggests that perceptions of personal control over sexual relationships and the perceived ability to use condoms whatever the situation can predict intentions to use condoms. Where respondents expect not to have control, either over sexual relationships generally or condom use specifically, they are less likely to intend to use condoms. A willingness to take risks as a general trait of individuals also provides additional predictive power in the model.

      "Abstract: This paper reviews some of the major themes of social policy in Britain over the past decade and examines in detail the impact on disabled people in three major areas: employment; income and social security provision; and the organisation and delivery of health and social welfare services. It will be argued that, despite some superficial similarities between the demands of disabled people and the rhetoric of the New Right for reductions in dependency and control by the state, the dominant policy themes of free market forces, privatisation and reductions in the scope of welfare state services have not served disabled people's interests well. Moreover, attempts to “protect” disabled people within a much reduced welfare state have not been effective and have in arty case had the unwelcome consequence of increasing the scrutiny and control exercised by professionals and others. This stands in contrast to the alternative policy agenda articulated by disabled people themselves, which stresses autonomy, integration, an end to discrimination, and rights—to equal chances in employment, to an adequate level of income, and to services which enhance personal choice and facilitate independent living. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

      "Abstract: This article is a preliminary report on an investigation into the processes of investment decision‐making. Three case studies from three firms are presented which show disparities in a number of aspects of process, for example, the length of time taken to arrive at a decision, the number and intensity of disagreements and uncertainties encountered. Data were collected for these cases through semi‐structured interviewing from multiple informants in the three organizations, thereby permitting the use of analysis of variance techniques of the different perspectives given by informants. Perceptions of the effectiveness of the decisions were also gathered. One finding from the study is that the decisions with the lowest perceived effectiveness (in firm HE) also lost support from those involved in making the decision during the process, although the decision was eventually implemented. This decision also had the least agreement amongst informants as to the main sources of disagreements. Informants of all three decisions saw effect upon product quality and productivity, fit with business strategy and competitive position of the company as the most important factors to take into account in evaluating the decisions. In firm CG, however, there were disagreements as to how the investment should be evaluated. In the conclusions to the article a disucssion is given as to the nature of evaluation procedures in relation to the developing theory of information systems. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

      "Abstract: A series of papers on regulation and fines utilizes formal analysis to conclude that a firm's compliance with regulation increases when the fines for violation are increased. The common denominator of these papers is the modelling of the firm as a decision-maker under risk: the firm's goal is to minimize expected losses given some probability that it may get caught violating certain regulations. A better approach is to derive these probabilities given that the regulatory agency endeavors to maximize its own gains. Therefore, the agency-firm interaction must be modelled explicitly as a game. If such an approach is adopted, the size of the fine or the level of standards has no impact upon the behavior of the firm under a wide range of conditions. On the contrary, an increase in the fine or a lowering of the standards reduces the frequency with which the agency enforces the law. © 1991, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

First, one has the choice between a continuum of decision alternatives and a finite, usually small, number of alternatives. The choice does not merely pose a technical problem. We explain our preference for a discrete instead of a continuous model, and we show the far-reaching consequences in the decision phase. Second, whereas Operations Research has been strong in the objective evaluation of the alternatives, it has generally ignored the subjective weighing. We sketch the potential of Operations Research in this area as well as the benefits of recent branches such as multi-criteria analysis and scenario analysis. This paper has been dedicated to Jacques Benders, at the occasion of his retirement from the Eindhoven University of Technology (June 1989). As a consultant of Philips Industries in Eindhoven, Benders cooperated during a long period of time with the present author on linear-programming applications in production allocation, trim-loss problems, traffic control, and on penalty-function methods for nonlinear programming (1963-1974). © 1991.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Analyses the reasons behind the decision to route the Channel Tunnel rail link to London via the Ove Arup easterly approach. Claimed environmental benefits of the proposed route over the British Rail rival seem negligible, benefits of preserving woodland are countered by damage that will result to the Rainham Marshes. Impact on residential properties along the route will be reduced although loss of industrial properties will be greater. The construction cost and transit times of the route will be greater. It is argued that the reasons for the routing are political, ensuring least damage to homes in Conservative marginal constituencies. The decision to delay a final decision on the proposed route is interpreted as a government side-step to avoid making a sensitive political decision. -N.Davey\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Loneliness is the emotional response to the discrepancy between desired and available relationships. As people grow old, the likelihood of experiencing age-related losses increases. Such losses may impede the maintenance or acquisition of desired relationships, resulting in a higher incidence of loneliness. This pilot study examines how loneliness relates to age-related losses, hopelessness, self-transcendence, and spiritual well-being in a convenience sample of 107 adults aged 65 years or older. The collective utility of the independent variables in predicting loneliness was investigated by means of a regression decision tree with an automatic random subset crossvalidation procedure. This procedure explained 46% of the variance. Higher scores for age-related losses and hopelessness were associated with higher loneliness scores. Higher scores for self-transcendence and existential spiritual well-being were associated with lower loneliness scores. © 1991.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospective host communities often oppose attempts to site new waste facilities despite the large benefits to society. This research identifies five crucial principles in community decision-making to test residents' preferences for impact management: Residents' intuitive separation of impacts into different accounts, community reference point for change, residents' different values for gains and losses, differences between residents' and decision-makers' values for gains and losses, and community need for control, fairness and limited tolerance for change. By applying these principles in survey researches of three landfill and two incinerator sites, residents' preferences for three impact reduction measures and three compensation measures are tested. Residents hold clear preferences for impact reduction through prevention, followed by control and mitigation. They least prefer compensation and often reject compensation measures as bribes. Residents responded well to the process of, first, expressing their concerns about impacts in separate categories, and secondly, choosing engineered options to address the impacts of concern. In the results, over 70 percent of residents express attitudes of accepting a waste facility with their preferred impact reduction measures. The process appears to empower the community to produce a more acceptable product and results in better community acceptance. © 1991.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The effectiveness and efficiency of any road safety policy measure depends directly on the availability and accuracy of the related data on which the safety measure is based. When a large portion of road accidents remains unreported, vital information concerning the characteristics of those accidents will also be lost. The choice of appropriate safety measures may, in turn, be adversely affected by this loss of data. This paper reports on the result of a research study undertaken to determine the extent, characteristics, and reasons for unreported road accidents in Riyadh. A stratified random sample of 2200 individuals were interviewed in person and data on their socio-economic traits as well as unreported road accidents and their costs were collected. Analysis of the data revealed that nearly 60 percent of road traffic accidents remained unreported. Individuals who frequently did not report their traffic accidents were found to be young, single, holding a driver's license and employed. People with no education reported the smallest number of their road accidents, and there existed a large variation in the distribution of unreported traffic accidents by different nationalities. The Chi-square test was applied to determine significant response variations. A methodology for the computation of unreporting accident potential is presented, and the cost characteristic of unreported accidents is analyzed. Measures to minimize the problem of unreported road accidents are discussed. © 1991 (A.H. 1411) King Saud University\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Floods in the U.S. kill an average of 162 people each year and cause $3.4 billion in property damage. Flood control programs have been successful in lowering, but not eliminating, the risks to lives and property. Since the late 1960s, the federal government has emphasized flood insurance as a primary tool for improving location and flood‐proofing decisions, as well as for reimbursing flood losses. Since only 12.7% of houses in flood plain areas are covered by flood insurance, the program has been ineffective. We interviewed people living in three communities that had recently been flooded. Most people had little knowledge of the cause of floods or what could be done to prevent damage. People who work and who are better educated know more and are more likely to have flood insurance. Current government publications about flood risks are not likely to be understood by those at risk. There is little effective communication about the nature and magnitude of the risks and what individuals can do to protect their lives and property and lower their financial risks. The risk management program should both emphasize communication and enforcement of the current law requiring people at risk who hold federally funded loans to be insured.

      "Abstract: In the UK, many jobs have been lost through plant closures over the last decade, and many of these have arisen from plant closures implemented in urban areas by multilocational firms. In this paper, a conceptual framework for analysing plant closures by multilocational firms is outlined and this is used to interpret data relating to Sheffield. Over the last decade the city experienced the closure of seventy-seven large plants and nearly 90% of these were closed by multilocational firms. Approximately 20% of these closures arose from a decision by a firm to quit a product line but the majority involved the closure of a plant while the firm maintained production of a similar product elsewhere. A distinction is made between intraurban and interurban selection and an interview programme is used to identify the factors which influence interurban selective closures. Whereas previous studies have dismissed the influence of the local environment on the closure decision, a small but distinct environmental influence is detected. The plants selected for closure have one or more of the following characteristics: small product range; low level of productivity; less-sophisticated technology; older buildings and machinery; a smaller number of employees; a greater distance from head-office. Characteristics which arise from the local environment are: site difficulties; poor labour relations; and, less certainly, higher local tax demands. -from Author\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study explores the qualitative experience of illness demands from the woman's own perspective by asking, \"What is the impact of breast cancer on the daily lives of women of childbearing age?\" Semistructured interviews with 79 women newly diagnosed with breast cancer were transcribed and analyzed to discern illness demands. Content analysis yielded 14 domains of illness demands: treatment issues, change in life context or perspective, acceptance of the illness, social interaction or support, physical changes, reconstructing the self, uncertainty, loss, making comparisons, acquiring new knowledge, making choices, mortality issues, financial or occupational concerns, and making a contribution. Illness demands are experienced in every aspect of a woman's life, including her identity, daily routines, family and social experience, and her perception of the past, present, and future. This study details in the women's own language the considerable adjustments brought on by a diagnosis of breast cancer.\u001b[0m :\n",

For instance, do people prefer to experience 2 negative events (e.g., manuscript rejections) on the same day or on different days? Do people prefer to experience 2 positive events (e.g., manuscript acceptances) on the same or different days? This article proposes a renewable resources model that combines elements of decision-making models (prospect theory) with the notion that people possess limited but renewable physiological, cognitive, and social resources for dealing with emotionally impactful events. As predicted, Ss preferred to separate 2 positive events (the gain-savoring hypothesis), to separate 2 negative events (the multiple-loss-avoidance hypothesis), and to combine a positive and a negative event (the loss-buffering hypothesis).

      "Abstract: The widely replicated preference reversal phenomenon (PRP) violates most theories of decision under risk. People exhibiting PRP choose a safe bet (with a large chance of a small gain) over a long shot (with a small chance of a larger gain). But, when bidding to buy or sell each bet, they bid more for the long shot. Surprisingly, in Experiment 1, a new opposite reversal pattern (NPRP) was found: Safe bets typically received larger bids than long shots and reversals were far more frequent when the long shot was chosen. In Experiment 2, NPRP was found for $100 expected value bets, but PRP occurred for bets with $3 expected values. The task characteristics apparently necessary to produce NPRP are (1) bids in the form of maximum buying prices, (2) possibility of loss in bidding, but not in choice, and (3) large payoffs. It is argued that wealth effects predicted by expected utility theory are too small to explain NPRP. Instead, it is hypothesized that a contingent decision process underlies the shift in reveral patterns and that aspiration levels exert increased influence in bidding to buy when payoffs are large. © 1991.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Summary:  A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Santiago, Chile to test the efficacy of the Children's Epilepsy Program, a child‐centered, family‐focused intervention developed and pilot tested in Los Angeles, CA, U.S.A., using a counseling model for parents of children with seizure disorders to help them (a) deal with their anger, resentment, and grief related to the loss of a normal child; (b) increase their knowledge about caring for their child; (c) reduce anxieties related to having a child with a seizure disorder; and (d) improve their decisionmaking skills. All parents were pretested and then retested 5 months after the educational interventions. Parents in the experimental group (n = 185) and their children separately attended four 1 A‐h sessions and then met together at the end of each session to share learning experiences. Comparison group parents (n = 180) and their children jointly attended three 2‐h lecture sessions followed by question‐and‐answer periods. Although parents' overall knowledge of epilepsy was relatively high initially, it improved considerably in both comparison and experimental groups. With regard to anxiety, at the 5‐month evaluation, experimental group parents and mothers in particular were more likely than control parents to state that they were less anxious (p < 0.001), and their anxiety, as measured by the Taylor Manifest Anxiety scale, was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Une étude randomisée et contrôlée a été menée à Santiago (Chili), afin ďévaluer ľefficacitéďun programme ďéducation pour ľépilepsie de ľenfant: il s'agit ďune intervention centrée sur ľenfant, en milieu familial, qui a été mise au point et testée à Los Angeles (U.S.A.) selon un modèle de conseils aux parents ďenfants épleptiques. Ce programme avait pour but: (1) de traiterles sentiments de colère, ressentiment, et tristesse liés à la perte ďun enfant normal; (2) augmenter les connaissances surles soins à apporter àľenfant; (3) réduire ľanxiété liée àľépilepsie de leur enfant; (4) améliorer leur formation et leur conduite. Tous les parents ont été evalués de façon préliminaire puis ré‐évalués 5 mois après les interventions éducatives. Les parents du groupe expérimental (n = 185) et leurs enfants ont assisté séparément à 4 sessions ď1 heure 1/2, puis se rencontraient à la fin de chaque session pour partager leur expérience ďapprentissage. Un groupe contrôle de parents (n = 180) et leurs enfants ont assisté ensemble à 3 sessions comprenant des cours de 2 heures suivis par des sessions de questions et réponses. Bien que la connaissance globale de ľépilepsie chez les parents ait été relativement importante dès le départ, elle a été considérablement amealiorée dans le groupe expérimental comme dans le groupe contrôle. En ce qui concerne ľanxiété, ľévaluation à 5 mois a montré que les parents du groupe expérimental, en particulier les mères, signalaient plus souvent que les parents du groupe contrôle qu'ils étaient moins anxieux (p < 0.001); leur anxiété, mesurée par ľéchelle ďAnxiété Manifeste de Taylor, était significativement moindre (p < 0.01). Eine randomisierte, kontrollierte Studie wurde in Santiago, Chile durchgeführt, um die Wirkung eines Kinder‐Epilepsie‐Programms zu testen: dabei handelt es sich um ein in Los Angeles, Kalifornien entwickeltes und pilotgetestetes Modell zur kind und familiengerechten Intervention, entsprechend einem Beratungsmodell für Eltern von Kindern mit Anfällen. Ziel war es, den Eltern zu helfen: (1) im Umgang mit ihren Ängsten, Resentiments und Kummer durch den Verlust eines normalen Kindes (2) ihr Wissen über die Betreuung ihres Kindes zu vergrößern (3) ihre Angst zu verringern, ein Kind mit einem Anfallsleiden zu haben (4) ihre Entscheidungsfähigkeit zu verstärken. Sämtliche Eltern wurden vorgetestet und 5 Monate später, nach der Unterweisung nachgetestet. In der Testgruppe (n = 185) besuchten die Eltern und ihre Kinder getrennt 4 1 1/2 Stunden Seminare, um sich nach jeder Sitzung noch gemeinsam zur Vertiefung des Gelernten zu treffen. In einer Vergleichgruppe (n = 180) besuchten Eltern und Kinder 3 2‐Stunden‐Vorlesungen, gefolgt von einer Frage‐ und Antwortstunde. Obwohl bei alien Eltern das Wissen ziemlich gut war, verbesserte es sich jedoch beträchtlich in beiden Gruppen. Bezüglich der Angst waren nach 5 Monaten die Eltern, besonders die Mütter der Testgruppe in der Lage zu sagen, sie seien weniger ängstlich als die der Kontrollgruppe (p = 0.001); gemessen an der Taylor‐Angst‐Skala war ihre Angst signifikant verringert (p = 0.01).

      "Abstract: Research supports the theory that after administrators make a decision, feedback, both positive and negative, and also the administrators' perceived security vis-à-vis their position affect their level of commitment to a course of action. However, this research fails to recognize that subjects of college age playing administrators in the simulated, experimental treatments which have been presented in the research had nothing personally to lose if they made a bad decision--an orientation contradictory to the reality of most actual administrative positions. Additionally, the research ignores the interactional effects of the personality of decision makers in terms of their anxiety levels and the judgments they make. This study took both of these considerations into account by creating a decision-making situation within which prospective administrators made monetary commitments to long-term goals while their anxiety level, both as a basic personality attribute and an index of the reality of the decision-making process, was monitored under conditions of varying levels of job insecurity and resistance to their policies in relation to their decisions. Analyses revealed that contrary to the results of past research which used college students as subjects: (1) there is a significant negative correlation between levels of anxiety and commitments to previously chosen courses of action; (2) there are no significant effects of job security on commitment; and, most importantly, (3) high resistance to a policy decision leads to significantly less monetary commitments to long-term goals. The findings suggest that the basis for the contradictory results lies with the anxiety level of decision makers and the realism of experiencing a loss by making poor decisions.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The mean‐variance criterion is one of the most frequently used methods for selecting investment portfolios. Yet, because it is an approximation of an investor's maximum expected utility choice, some theoreticians and practitioners have criticized the approach. This paper examines the investment loss that different investors experience by accepting a mean‐variance efficient portfolio. Simulated security returns with extreme distributional characteristics are used to determine the extent of an investor's loss. The results indicate that even under very unreasonable investment distributional assumptions, an investor's loss by accepting a mean‐variance efficient choice rarely exceeds a small fraction of one percent per invested dollar.

      "Abstract: The function of the reference point was studied with individuals and groups deciding among bets. Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) asserts that a psychological reference point is influenced by recent changes in one's current asset. Based on this notion, a person who has experienced losses recently was predicted to make riskier choices than a person who has not, but no systematic risk preference was expected for a person experiencing recent gains. Subjects' individual choices were generally consistent with these notions, although one of the key assumptions of the theory was violated. Assuming that a loss person will have a greater influence over a group decision, a group containing a loss member was anticipated to make riskier decisions than a group that does not. The results of three-person group decisions did not show this pattern; instead, the idiosyncratic risky preference of a loss member was found to be overridden by majority influence from nonloss members. Discussion focused on the implications of the loss member's idiosyncratic choice and of the robustness of social/normative factors relative to task/ individual factors. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study simulated an organizational dispute to test two hypotheses derived from the strategic choice model of mediation about the influence of third-party power and interests on negotiation. The first hypothesis was that third-party compensation-the capacity to offer negotiators positive benefits-would produce a \"chilling effect,\" i.e., reduced concessions and greater negotiator hostility, especially when negotiators believed that the third party had a stake in the outcome of negotiation. The second hypothesis was that third-party pressure-the capacity to expunge negotiator benefits-would produce a \"hastening effect,\" i.e., greater concessions and cooperativeness between negotiators, especially when negotiators believed that the third party had no stake in the outcome. Both hypotheses were supported. The results suggest that negotiators sometimes use concession making as a strategy to affect the behavior of powerful third parties-either to elicit positive benefits or to avoid the loss of benefits-depending on their beliefs about what the mediator has at stake. Also, the results suggest that the strategic choice model of mediation is useful for understanding negotiator behavior as well as mediator behavior. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

Empirical tests of this hypothesis have been inconclusive. Here, we test the hypothesis in a very practical way. We examine the effects of turnover of met versus unmet preferences of two important job characteristics, instrumental communication and decision influence. Employees with strong preferences for such characteristics are arguably key organisational members, the loss of whom could be expensive. Our empirical findings have both research and practical implications. Researchers might note that met expectation effects are more likely to be found when multiple expectations are examined. Human resource practitioners might note that organisations are particularly vulnerable to the loss of employees whose expectations of professional involvement are not met.

      "Abstract: The goal of the research was to compare decisions under risk in a situation in which forecasters (F) communicate to decision makers (DM) either numerically (e.g., .70) or verbally (e.g., likely) about the chances that a binary event will occur. Following each forecast, the DM bid for a winning or losing lottery based on the event. In Experiment 1 Fs and DMs also provided numerical translations of each verbal forecast after the DMs' bid. In Experiment 2 the DMs provided membership functions over the [0, 1] interval for each phrase used by the Fs. The primary results were: (a) extreme similarity in the DM's bids and rates of bidding under the two modes of communication; (b) greater variability in bids to specific verbal than numerical forecasts; (c) a pattern of bids, in which DMs demonstrated risk seeking for gains and risk neutrality for losses; (d) DMs' numerical translations in Experiment 1 were closer to .50 than were those of Fs; and (e) phrases selected by Fs had high membership values to DMs for the probabilities the Fs were attempting to describe. Points (a), (b), (d), and (e) are consistent with the ν-μ model which assumes that the vague meaning of a probability phrase can be represented by a membership function over the [0, 1] interval, and that in reaching a decision the DM focuses on a range of probabilities with sufficiently high membership. Point (c) is speculatively attributed to social aspects of the dyadic situation, and requires further investigation. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Subjects' frame of reference was manipulated in a hypothetical medical decision-making task patterned after Tversky and Kahneman's (1981) \"Asian disease task\". Subjects in the positive framing condition received an option of definitely saving one-third of the lives of potential victims of a new outbreak of AIDS and an option with a one-third probability of saving all lives and a two-thirds probability of saving no lives. Equivalent options in the negative framing condition were one where two-thirds would die and one where there is one-third probability no one would die and two-thirds probability that all would die. Characteristics of the potential groups of victims were also manipulated. Results for the more desirable victim group, hemophiliacs, displayed the usual preference reversal with changing frame of reference: risk-averse choices when considering \"lives saved\" and risk-seeking choices when considering \"lives lost\". This was not the case for the less desirable groups, e.g., intravenous drug users. These results were replicated in a forced-choice variant of the task. Analogous results were obtained when comparing risk-taking for \"ingroup\" and \"outgroup\" members. Results were discussed in terms of differences in the subjective value functions for \"lives saved\" and \"lives lost\" for the different groups. An independent scaling procedure supported the hypothesized differences in value functions. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

The reporting choice represents an intraperiod accounting decision. We show that this choice is a function of the demand for ex ante optimal risk sharing agreements between management and shareholders, although auditor identity and firm size are also found to influence the choice of reporting method. We model the policy choice as both a dichotomous and a more finely graded three‐way problem, introducing to the accounting literature an experimental technique designed to test for the existence of any mutual dependence between alternatives. © 1990 Accounting and Finance Association of Australia and New Zealand\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the N-prisoners' dilemma (NPD), cooperation produces ingroup efficiency. But if ingroup gains from cooperation are less than outgroup losses, then macro-efficiency for the collectivity (defined as ingroup plus outgroup) is harmed. We call this situation a layered prisoners' dilemma (LPD). The LPD models diverse real world situations - from OPEC's effect on consumers to interest groups' effect on citizens. We developed an experimental analogue to test three hypotheses about LPD behavior. We found that subjects' behavior was not motivated by a concern for macro-efficiency but, instead, was a function of ingroup interaction. Specifically, ingroup discussion decreased macro-efficient behavior, but the amount of the decrease depended on decision-making structures and ingroup perceptions of outgroup worthiness. The results suggest that macro-inefficient behavior will be ubiquitous due to the ease with which subjects form ingroups. But the results also suggest tactics for constraining macro-inefficient behavior, though the success of the tactics depends on the existence of crosscutting group loyalities.

      "Abstract: Decision‐making theory suggests that jurors will tend to choose the verdict that maximizes the expected gains minus the expected losses of each decision. Capital punishment (as compared to a maximum sentence of life imprisonment) would seem to increase the perceived negative consequences of a guilty verdict without affecting the consequences of a non‐guilty verdict. This should make guilty decisions less likely. To test this prediction, questionnaires were sent to all jurors who had served on 32 first degree murder trials in which capital punishment was not in effect and who reached guilty verdicts. They were asked whether their verdicts in the murder trial would have been affected if capital punishment had been a possible sentence. Thirty percent of the respondents replied that they would have been less likely to vote guilty, whereas only 3% said they would have been more likely to vote guilty. Of the 32 separate jury panels, 30 had at least one person who indicated that he or she would have been less likely to vote guilty; and in 7 trials, 50% or more of those who responded gave this answer. The results appear to indicate that the possibility of a death sentence reduces the likelihood of a guilty verdict. Copyright © 1990, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: After nearly three years of litigation, the Thatcher government lost its battle to permanently enjoin publication of former intelligence agent Peter Wright's Spycatcher in British newspapers. The Law Lords' judgment was based on recognition of the futility of attempting to prohibit dissemination of allegations about MI5 which were already widely available elsewhere in the world. But immediately after the decision, the government took far-reaching steps to ensure that its official secrets would remain secret. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents an information‐theoretic, infinite horizon model of the equity issue decision. The model predicts that (a) equity issues on average are preceded by an abnormal positive return on the stock, although for some firms the issue is preceded by a loss; (b) equity issues on average are preceded by an abnormal rise in the market; and (c) the stock price drops at the announcement of an issue. The model provides a measure of the welfare cost of asymmetric information; the welfare loss may be small even if the price drop at issue announcement is large. 1990 The American Finance Association\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Translation exposure hedging is frequently said to have begun after firms adopted SFAS No. 8 and assumed to have ceased–or at least decreased–after adoption of SFAS No. 52 due to different treatments of translation gains (losses). Based on proprietary data, this study presents evidence from a small sample of firms which would be predicted to cease hedging translation exposure, but of which the majority did not. The study focuses on eighteen firms which exclude at least 50% and up to 100% of the translation gains (losses) from the income statement after adopting SFAS No. 52. Of those eighteen firms, only seven ceased hedging. The other eleven firms not only continued hedging translation exposure, but hedged translation exposure of only those subsidiaries whose translation gains (losses) are now excluded from the income statement. Characteristics which might explain the different decision are investigated: proportion of assets which are nonmonetary; the proportion of net assets located abroad; the geographic dispersion of subsidiaries; and the estimated effect on the balance sheet and income statement of changing from the temporal method to the current rate method of translation. Univariate test results indicate that the geographic dispersion of die foreign subsidiaries as well as the proportion of net assets located abroad differ significantly between firms which ceased hedging and those which continued hedging after adopting the standard. Weak evidence of differential effects of the change to the current rate method on individual firm income statements and of different composition of assets between the two groups also was found. Multivariate analysis, using a linear probability model as well as a randomization procedure, provided weak results corroborating the significance of the proportion of net foreign assets to consolidated assets in differentiating between firms which ceased hedging and those which continued.

      "Abstract: The turnover of management following a merger or acquisition is a significant, yet understudied, human resource issue. We propose that the relevant HR question is not merely how to retain top managers, but of equal importance, whether or not top management retention should be an objective. We present a model that integrates the retention process with the overall integration strategy being pursued by the acquiring firm. The model prompts a discussion of those factors that influence the decision as to whether the top management of the acquired firm should be retained. We conclude by identifying appropriate HR tactics for managing the retention process. Copyright © 1990 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The decision for nursing home placement of a parent has been identified as one of the most difficult decisions for adult children to make. These decisions are made in a family context and are characterized by moral dilemmas. Expressions of loss of attachment or bonding, desires to maintain affective roles with parents following admission, and hurt avoidance for parents, family, and self appear in the decision for nursing home placement and are carried through into the actual admission. Knowledge about adult daughter's perceptions surrounding the decision for nursing home placement can aid nursing staff in anticipatory socialization for daughter and parent. Involvement of daughters in the decision for placement and the period immediately after admission could promote family interactions, foster trust in building relationships with the staff, and possibly decrease the incidence of relocation to other nursing homes.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research has demonstrated that the way in which decision problems are formulated or 'framed', can have strong and predictable effects on people's preference for alternatives with risky or certain outcomes. To predict people's behavior in decisions in less restricted situations, we studied what frame people prefer and whether this preference is related to their preference for risky or certain options. In this article we present two experiments testing the hypothesis that preference for a frame in which the alternatives are described as losses (loss frame) will lead to risk seeking and preference for gain frames will lead to risk aversion. We tested this relation including standard problems in the domain of human lives and more everyday problems. Results provided weak support for the predicted relation, but in the domain of human lives only. In the second experiment we included two types of problem presentation. We did obtain a substantial effect of the initial problem presentation on option preference, moreover, this effect was obtained irrespective of the frame subjects preferred to describe the problem. Results indicate that the initial problem presentation has an overriding effect on option preference. Implications of these findings are discussed. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper focuses on the evaluation, from an individual and societal perspective, of risk in terms of possible loss of life due to an exposure to two different types of events over a period of time. The two types are: risk of death from a catastrophic event (a sudden death of many people in a disaster at a yet unknown point in time) expected to occur during a planning period, or risk of death from another event (e.g. disease, road accident, etc) which claims fewer lives each year. but for which the expected total number of deaths over the planning period is equal to the expected number of deaths from the catastrophic event. Our analysis considers the extreme case in which these two types of events have the same probabilities of death every year and the same expected number of fatalities over the planning period. The individual's decision problem is described using a von-Neumann Morgenstern (vNM) utility function. The model suggests that the choice between these types of events depends on the value of the following variables: the probability of death over the planning period, the length of the planning period, the individual's time preference pattern, and the utility of being in different anxiety states. Stochastic extensions that may direct the public decision making process (involving aggregated preferences) are discussed. We also discuss issues of implementation. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

Risk associated with the substitution of debt for equity in the firm's capital structure is a determining factor in financial decision-making. In this paper, an instructive model incorporating the structure of decision analysis is developed in order that managers may visualize clearly the monetary loss and gain associated with different debt to equity ratios.

      "Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of sampling variability - in estimating forecast probabilities - on optimal decision making and the economic value of probability forecasts in the context of the cost-loss decision model. One effect is that the strategy, \"protect if and only if the forecast probability is greater than C/L', is not necessarily optimal. A second is that failure to adjust for sampling variability leads to biased estimates of the value of probability forecasts. The bias, which is small when probability forecasts are based on large training samples, can be substantial when data are scarce - as may be the case in the context of long-range forecasting. -from Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A survey of aphicide use in winter wheat was carried out in the summer of 1984. The survey of more than 60 000 ha revealed that many crops were treated late, dimethoate was the insecticide most frequently used, tank mixes with fungicides were common, and there were regional differences in spray timing and pesticide usage. An existing model of the economic benefits of spraying against the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae F.) was used in conjunction with aphid population assessments in two counties and aphid population predictions from a model, based on aerial samples of aphids, in a third county. The combination of a wide range in aphid population levels between fields, and economically irrational spraying, often resulted in low profits or financial losses. It is proposed that field-by-field decision-making, initiated by a regional forecast and guided by an accessible advisory system based on variable economic thresholds, would improve the accuracy of the decision-making process of cereal farmers in the UK. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Organizations are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of the direct costs of accidents on financial performance. The current annual cost of accidents incurred by industrial enterprises is more than $44.5 billion (National Safety Council, 1989). Increasingly, organizations are discovering that the degree of operating leverage (i.e. the ratio of percentage change in operating income to the percentage change in operating costs and/or sales or units sold) is adversely affected. Reducing the cost of accidents will lower the degree of operating leverage. I describe here an accident cost impact model that a variety of enterprises can use to disclose the direct costs of accidents and the economic impact on cost-volume-profit performance standards and profitability potential. The indirect costs of accidents are not calculated into this model formula, chiefly because no suitable model for verifying them with any reasonable accuracy has been developed. A pilot study to verify the efficiency of the direct cost accident model was performed on cost-volume-profit data supplied by a self-insured marine operation on the west coast. Every effort has been made to keep this accident cost impact model compatible with the loss-report accounting systems in use in today's organizations. The model is designed to be simple to understand and implement, to provide timely feedback for improved analysis and decision-making, and to cost little to operate. © 1990.\u001b[0m :\n",

Lapses are not predicted by IQ or vocabulary test scores (AH 4 parts 1 and 2, and Mill Hill). These paradoxical findings reveal some logical and methodological difficulties in the interpretations of subjective self-ratings. Age and IQ differences in the memorability of errors were illustrated using choice reaction time (CRT) tasks. All age groups were equally efficient at ‘automatic’ error detection and correction, but older individuals more often omitted controller error-signalling responses. Errors followed by controlled responses were better remembered. It is argued that conscious self-monitoring and the ability to remember errors improves with IQ and declines with age. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Looking back over the span of years surveyed, it appears that a sad experience, even many years ago, commonly leaves residual pain. This can be modified by sympathetic support enabling parents and baby to interact, although such interaction is not without painful as well as pleasurable effects. Coming to terms with loss may take longer than was previously thought. This study highlights the need for bereavement care, which aims to leave families with positive rather than negative feelings. Perhaps, for mental health, the eventual feelings about past happenings are more important than the happenings themselves, although we have also shown that a greater insight into the needs of parents at the time modified their long-term feelings for the good, some even indicating that they had been enriched by the whole experience. The interviews suggested that parents who were involved with their baby's care were more able to accept the reality of their loss and to adjust to the experience of pain and grief than was possible for those who had been kept apart from their children. This supports conclusions by other grief counsellors (e.g. Warden 1983).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many studies of the decision to retire have found that self-reported poor health increases the probability of retirement. Yet doubts have been expressed about whether such reported health problems constitute a genuine reason rather than a socially acceptable justification for not working. Our analysis shows conclusively that the probability of dying within two years after retiring and the probability of seeking medical care at the time of retiring are much higher for all retirees who report work-limiting health problems and especially for those who report such problems and retire before age 65. These findings, which imply that those retirees who report work-limiting health problems do not use health as an excuse for retiring, have important implications for public policy. The 1983 Amendments to the Social Security Act specified a gradual increase in the age of entitlement to the full amount of annual benefits, from age 65 to age 67. This delay in benefits is likely to cause financial hardship for workers whose health problems impair their ability to work because they will not be able to offset their loss of benefits through earnings from continued work.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives - To assess outside a clinical trial the psychological outcome of different treatment policies in women with early breast cancer who underwent either mastectomy or breast conservation surgery depending on the surgeon's opinion or the patient's choice. To determine whether the extent of psychiatric morbidity reported in women who underwent breast conservation surgery was associated with their participation in a randomised clinical trial. Design - Prospective, mutlicentre study capitalising on individual and motivational differences among patients and the different management policies among surgeons for treating patients with early breast cancer. Setting - 12 District general hospitals, three London teaching hospitals, and four private hospitals. Patients - 269 Women under 75 with a probable diagnosis of state I or II breast cancer who were referred to 22 different surgeons. Interventions - Surgery and radiotherapy or adjuvant chemotherapy, or both, depending on the individual surgeon's stated preferences for managing early breast cancer. Main outcome measures - Anxiety and depression as assessed by standard methods two weeks, three months, and 12 months after surgery. Results - Of the 269 women, 31 were treated by surgeons who favoured mastectomy, 120 by surgeons who favoured breast conservation, and 118 by surgeons who offered a choice of treatment. Sixty two of the women treated by surgeons who offered a choice were eligible to choose their surgery, and 43 of these chose breast conserving surgery. The incidences of anxiety, depression, and sexual dysfunction were high in all treatment groups. There were no significant differences in the incidences of anxiety and depression between women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy. A significant effect of surgeon type on the incidence of depression was observed, with patients treated by surgeons who offered a choice showing less depression than those treated by other surgeons (p = 0.06). There was no significant difference in psychiatric morbidity between women treated by surgeons who offered a choice who were eligible to choose their treatment and those in the same group who were not able to choose. Most of the women (159/244) gave fear of cancer as their primary fear rather than fear of losing a breast. The overall incidences of psychiatric morbidity in women who underwent mastectomy and those who underwent lumpectomy were similar to those found in the Cancer Research Campaign breast conservation study. (At 12 months 28% of women who underwent mastectomy in the present study were anxious compared with 26% in the earlier study, and 27% of women in the present study who underwent lumpectomy were anxious compared with 31% in the earlier study. In both the present and earlier study 21% of women who underwent mastectomy were depressed, and 19% of women who underwent lumpectomy in the present study were depressed compared with 27% in the earlier study). Conclusions - There is still no evidence that women with early breast cancer who undergo breast conservation surgery have less psychiatric morbidity after treatment than those who undergo mastectomy. Women who surrender autonomy for decision making by agreeing to participate in randomised clinical trials do not experience any different psychological, sexual, or social problems from those women who are treated for breast cancer outside a clinical trial.\u001b[0m :\n",

Nondeprived families reported stable employment at both times. Adolescents in deprived households, especially boys, reported the highest conflict with parents. Adolescents in recovery families reported high conflict when parents were unemployed, but levels declined when parents were reemployed.

      "Abstract: Contrary to most formal models of decision making under risk and uncertainty that are built on the basis of prescriptive behavioral principles or axioms, this paper derives a descriptive model of decision making under ambiguity based on principles of behavior, i.e. principles that describe how people behave as opposed to how they should behave. The model assumes that people evaluate the impact of ambiguous probabilities by first anchoring on a given value of the unknown probability and then adjusting this by the net effect of imagining or \"trying out\" other values the probability could take. The mental simulation process incorporates giving differential weight to the ranges of probability values above and below the anchor where such weight reflects individual and situational variables. In particular, the assumption that people are cautious as opposed to reckless in making decisions leads to attributing more weight to possible values of probabilities below the anchor when considering potential gains, and the reverse when faced with potential losses. Two experiments test implications of the model for situations involving competitive decisions. The first concerns legal decision making, the second involves the purchase and sale of industrial equipment. Both experiments validate predictions that (a) the effects of ambiguity depend on both the sign of payoffs and the level of probabilities, and (b) two parties to a negotiation or transaction may be differentially sensitive to ambiguity. Finally, the model is compared to other models of ambiguity proposed in the literature, and directions are suggested for future work. © 1989 J.C.

The objective of the study was to examine the relationship between a variety of organizational and respondent factors and the willingness of the facility to admit AIDS patients. In addition, the impact of specific changes on willingness to admit AIDS patients, the concerns of administrators, and suggested alternatives for the care of AIDS patients were examined. Findings indicate that about 11 percent of responding long term care facilities would consider admission of AIDS patients. No organizational or respondent characteristics were associated with greater likelihood of considering admission of AIDS patients. About 25% of respondents indicated their facility would consider admission of AIDS patients if specific facility or reimbursement changes were made. The major concerns of respondents if AIDS patients were admitted were loss of staff and worry that current residents would leave the facility. About sixty percent of respondents indicated their preferred choice for providing care to AIDS patients was separate long term care facilities for AIDS patients.

      "Abstract: This paper has attempted to test the applicability of the Public Choice approach in explaining regulation in the Indian Sugar Industry over the 1967-82 period. A test for discriminating between Public Interest and Capture theories of regulation was developed and implemented in the context of the historical pattern of controls found in the Indian Sugar Industry. The results point toward the rejection of the Public Interest theory of regulation and are consistent with the hypothesis of the capture of regulation by the regulated industry. The importance of the various interest groups and their influence on the regulation actually enacted was also revealed by the analysis. The findings are consistent with the existence of substantial rent-seeking and other D.U.P. activity (Bhagwati, 1982) in the Indian sugar sector during the post-independence period. They point toward the substantial welfare losses suffered by consumers and the economy at large as a result of the control regime that has existed in the Indian sugar sector. Removal of such controls will more than likely increase the availability of sugar at lower prices thus increasing the welfare of consumers while reducing the extent of corruption and other rent-seeking activity that the controls have generated. © 1989 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper examines the risk propensities of experienced executives in the oil and gas industry faced with a hypothetical risky business decision that involves significant gains and losses. The executives were asked to provide the minimum price their firm should accept before selling their share of a joint exploration venture whose future prospects were systematically varied to include gains only, losses only, and mixed gains and losses. In addition, they were asked to provide a single probability equivalence for a mixed gain/loss situation in lieu of breaking even for sure. The executives were more risk taking than risk averse over pure losses, consistent with the prediction of prospect theory. Over pure gains, however, there was as much risk taking as risk aversion, with more risk taking occurring when the chance of breaking even was higher. The relationship between risk propensity over pure gains and over pure losses was insignificant, indicating very different attitudes in these two domains. Although the reflection effect did occur in some cases, it was not pervasive. There was a tendency for certainty equivalences to show greater risk taking than probability equivalences in mixed gain/loss situations, which was consistent with a reframing effect. Risk propensity over mixed gains and losses was closer to that expressed in the losses only domain than to risk propensity over pure gains. More than half of the executives gave responses that were fully consistent with expected utility, and an additional quarter of executives were consistent within a 10% margin of error in their responses. However, one out of five executives did not satisfy the stochastic dominance relationships among the certainty equivalences. Systematic inconsistencies occurred most frequently in the mixed situations where the certainty equivalences for some subjects were biased toward the outcome that had the predominant chance of occurring. © 1989 J.C.

      "Abstract: This paper discusses models of a person's risk attitude toward financial changes when his preferences depend on psychological effects of the changes, for example, effects on how the person is judged by himself and by others. These models represent the risk attitude of a person who due to these effects is risk averse for outcomes involving gains or the status quo but is risk prone for outcomes involving losses or the status quo. The models are prescriptive in that they exclude the heuristic biases that are studied in behavioral decision theory. They are examined from the descriptive, prescriptive, and normative perspectives. In particular, they are shown to satisfy the principles of expected utility but to violate several other normative principles. © 1989 J.C. Baltzer AG, Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

Longitudinal data were obtained from 126 employees 1 month prior to being permanently displaced. Within-subjects analyses then were used to test the ability of a behavioral choice model of motivation to predict behavioral intention to look for another job, effort in looking, and actual behavior/role choice 18 months later. The behavioral choice model significantly predicted all criteria. This study also investigated the determinants of displaced workers' expectancies for obtaining a new job. Expectancy for obtaining a job was inversely related with age, and positively with education, self-esteem, and the expectation of losing one's job.

      "Abstract: This paper reviews current thinking on the fiscal impact of privatization against the background of developments and prospects for privatization in Arab countries. It argues that the fiscal impact is likely to be slight in the absence of fundamental structural reforms by Arab countries to secure gains in allocative efficiency by the privatized enterprises. By itself, privatization may simply lead to a change in the government's asset portfolio. In the case of loss- making enterprises, the government may need to pay the private entrepreneur to take on the enterprise, particularly when the sources of inefficiency reflect government policy decisions that are not likely to be modified; alternatively, liquidation of the assets of unprofitable enterprises may be the appropriate policy. © 1989.\u001b[0m :\n",

The hypothesis holds that individuals are motivated to incur the minimal costs of voting in order to avoid the maximum regret: Their preferred candidate losing by a single vote. The results of our study suggest that a substantial number of people apparently do employ a minimax decision-making process. Over one-third of the individuals interviewed reported sometimes worrying that if they abstain from voting their favorite candidate might lose. In addition, these respondents were significantly more likely than those who expressed no worry to claim they voted in 1984 and to say they planned to vote in 1986. And perhaps most intriguing, further analysis suggests that individuals may be more likely to employ minimax decision making than expected utility decision making. © 1989, Sage Publications.

      "Abstract: Although researchers have investigated formal legal reactions to white‐collar crime, few data exist on informal reactions to white‐collar lawbreakers and how these reactions influence sentencing decisions. Even so, commentators often assert that whitecollar offenders receive lenient criminal penalties because judges sympathize with such offenders due to the losses they incur through informal sanctions. In this light, a causal model is used to explore the influence of class position on an important informal sanction—loss of job—and the influence of loss of job on sentence severity. Class position is found to determine the likelihood of loss of job but not that of incarceration. Further, offenders who commit large‐scale offenses are less likely to suffer loss of job than those who commit small‐scale crimes. Social reactions to white‐collar crime are inconsistent, and class position more strongly influences informal, nongovernmental social control than social control through law.

The competitive environment, NASA organization characteristics (its structure, processes, and transactions), and the regulatory environment all influenced the decision to proceed with the launch. To be effective, strategies to control, change, or eliminate undesireable behavior should address the cause of that behavior. Understanding how organizations contribute to technical system accidents leads to the conclusion that efforts to reduce accidents in risky technological systems must include the organizations that produce them.

      "Abstract: This article presents an extension of the interactive multicriteria linear‐programming method of Zionts and Wallenius [see Management Science, 29(5) (1983)]. The decision maker's underlying utility function is assumed to be pseudoconcave, and his preference structure is assessed through pairwise comparison questions. In the method of Zionts and Wallenius, the decision maker's preference structure is represented as constraints on the weights on the objectives derived from his responses. This representation is only a linear approximation to the underlying nonlinear utility function. Accordingly, inconsistency among the constraints on the weights arises while solving the problem. Therefore, some of the constraints have to be dropped, resulting in a loss of information on the preference structure, and hence an increase in the total number of questions. In this article we develop a hybrid representation scheme to avoid this problem. The proposed scheme is implemented within the algorithmic framework of the method of Zionts and Wallenius, and its underlying theory is developed. Computational results show that the number of questions required by the Zionts and Wallenius method can be sinificantly reduced using the proposed scheme.

      "Abstract: Nursing homes today are promoting the physical, emotional, and psychosocial security of their residents while involving them and their families in the ultimate decision making. These efforts, however, do not minimize nursing homes' responsibility to ensure a secure environment through good risk management and loss prevention techniques. Facility managers should annually evaluate policies and procedures to ensure that department standards are realistic and reflect the accepted standard of care owed to residents. Technological and functional developments in healthcare make continuous staff training programs a necessity. Involving patients and their families in care planning and treatment decisions can enhance residents' feelings of security. These feelings are further bolstered by a safe environment. Staff should also be alert to changes in residents' behavior. When a resident is admitted to a nursing home, managers should obtain signed consent forms for potential future medical treatment and resident trips. Managers' responsibilities also extend to situations beyond their control. All long-term care facilities must have practical plans in case of natural disasters.\u001b[0m :\n",

Several axiomatic theories have been proposed to explain some of this evidence, but there are few data that discriminate between the theories. To gather such data, an experiment was conducted using pairs of gambles with three levels of outcomes and many combinations of probabilities. Most typical findings were replicated, including the common consequence effect and different risk attitudes for gains and losses. There is evidence of both fanning out and fanning in of indifference curves, and both quasiconcavity and quasiconvexity of preferences. No theory can explain all the data, but prospect theory and the hypothesis that indifference curves fan out can explain most of them. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

In this article we study a Monte Carlo method for approximating the Bayesian action and its posterior expected loss. The Monte Carlo approximation to the Bayesian action is obtained through (a) approximating the posterior expected loss function by using the Monte Carlo integration method and (b) searching the minimum of the approximated posterior expected loss function. As the Monte Carlo sample size diverges to infinity, the Monte Carlo approximations are shown to be convergent in general situations. The rates of the convergence are also obtained under some regularity conditions on the loss function. Two accuracy measures of the Monte Carlo approximations are proposed.

      "Abstract: This study was performed to examine the relevance of the quasi-withdrawal syndrome in nondependent rats to the syndrome precipitated by naltrexone in rats physically dependent upon morphine. Morphine-dependent rats trained to discriminate between SC injections of naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) and saline were pretreated with 10 mg/kg of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor: 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), Ro 20-1724, or papaverine. The naltrexone stimulus-generalization curve and dose-response curve for loss of body weight were shifted to the left by IBMX and Ro 20-1724, which produce quasi-withdrawal, but not by papaverine, which does not. IBMX also potentiated the naltrexone-like discriminative effects and loss of body weight induced by cyclazocine, an opioid agonist-antagonist. Butorphanol, another agonist-antagonist, occasioned choice responding appropriate for saline when tested alone but engendered more than 50% naltrexone-appropriate choice responses in rats pretreated with IBMX. Thus, phosphodiesterase inhibitors that produce an opiate quasi-withdrawal syndrome potentiate interoceptive stimuli and weight loss associated with the withdrawal syndrome precipitated by naltrexone in morphine-dependent rats. Furthermore, they appear to enhance the opiate-antagonist activity of opioids with mixed agonist and antagonist properties. © 1989.\u001b[0m :\n",

In the subject-decision conditions, the students selected (prior to knowledge about their performance) which task would count. The experimenter selected the crucial task in the experimenter-decision conditions. Feedback from the task that did not count indicated to subjects in high-referent conditions that they would have won the reward if these scores had counted, whereas subjects in low-referent conditions learned they would have lost no matter which set of scores counted. All subjects \"lost\" on the task that counted. Only subjects in the high-referent, experimenter-decision condition subsequently expressed feelings of unfair treatment.

      "Abstract: Prophylactic use of misoprostol has been found to cause a 15-fold reduction in the rat of gastric ulcer among symptomatic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug users with osteoarthritis. Using data from a variety of sources, we performed a decision analytic-based evaluation of direct medical costs in these patients to determine whether routine prophylactic use of this medication is a preferred strategy over no prophylaxis. The base-care analysis revealed that misoprostol is cost-reducing for the initial 3 months of prophylaxis when the compliance rate is 60%, the silent ulcer rate is 40%, and the medication is priced below $1.74/d (expected costs per patient of approximately $300). The model is highly sensitive to changes in these parameters. Changing the rates of hospitalization and operation have less effect. Reliable estimates of misoprostol's economic impact after the initial 3 months of treatment are impossible to develop with current data. Nonmedical direct costs, patient's out-of-pocket costs, and indirect economic effects, such as work loss, were not considered in the model. All would enhance the economic benefit of the medicaiton. Health care policy makers and payers must consider trade-offs between the clinical and economic implications of preventive medical interventions, such as misoprostol, especially as the call intensifies for more efficient allocation of health care resources.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Principles in the judgment/decision making literature relevant to the legal community are reviewed. These principles are divided into four areas: the decision process itself, communicating a judgment to others, evaluating a decision, and possible ways of “debiasing.” Several influences on the decision process are enumerated, among them being insufficient consideration of base rates, selective memory for relevant material, the framing of the decision in either the domain of losses or the domain of gains, and consideration of the “cues to causation.” Particular attention is paid to suboptimal consideration of covariation information. In communicating the decision to others the two most prominent findings are overconfidence in expressing one's decision and the inability to describe accurately the bases of one's decision. Evaluating a decision is plagued by two biases. The first is the hindsight bias. After an event has occurred we tend to exaggerate how easily we could have predicted the event beforehand. The second is the outcome bias. We tend to base our evaluation of the decision upon the evaluation of the outcome. Among the debiasing techniques mentioned are the admonition to “consider the opposite” of the preferred option, the reduction of reliance on memory, and the use of decision aids.

      "Abstract: Most of the analysis of costs associated with the introduction of risky prospects has concerned contingent costs amenable to insurance programs. An important missing element is the current cost associated with changes in uncertainty. These costs are not amenable to insurance plans and require compensation in order to prevent transfers. In a novel approach, this paper develops an application of prospect theory to such questions, in an intergenerational context. The importance of such an application is demonstrated in a case study of the high-level nuclear waste repository (HNWR) siting decision. As a case study, the costliness of obtaining some elements of the analysis leads to a simulation approach, comparing prospect costs at the three sites that were under consideration by the U.S. Department of Energy. Finding that such costs can be large, we argue for a reassessment of current risk analysis approaches. On a policy note, on the basis of the prospect cost analysis here, the choice of the Yucca Mountain, Nevada, HNWR site seems ill-advised. © 1988 Kluwer Academic Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

Subjects in the Explicit Inference condition were asked to explicitly estimate the values of missing information before making their responses while subjects in the Implicit Inference condition were not. The manner in which probability information was framed was also manipulated. Experiment 1 employed hypothetical gambles and Experiment 2 employed gambles with real money. Expressed likelihood of taking gambles was higher when probability was phrased in terms of '% chance of winning' rather than '% chance of losing', but this difference was somewhat less with real gambles than with hypothetical gambles. Confidence ratings in each experiment were actually higher on incomplete information trials than on complete information trials in the Explicit Inference condition.

      "Abstract: Abstract.  This paper analyzes the decision‐facilitating role of external accounting reports in large capital markets in which managers are costlessly motivated to act in the best interests of investors. Given homogeneous beliefs, time‐additive preferences, and a sufficient variety of tradeable claims, external accounting reports are shown to provide a basis for Pareto improvements (relative to merely reporting dividends) only if those reports provide a means of making better production decisions. In a large economy, with both economy‐wide and firm‐specific risks, such improvements are shown to occur if the reports reveal events that affect the future productivity of the economy or individual firms or events that will result in economy‐wide windfall gains or losses. However, reports that reveal future firm‐specific windfall gains or losses have no value, even though they would affect market prices. Furthermore, while resources will be allocated more efficiently if managers have information about the productivity of their firms, the economy can achieve those efficiency gains without reporting firm‐specific productivity information to investors, provided that investors hold well‐diversified investment portfolios and are aware of each manager's information structure and decision criterion (which is to maximize the “full information” value of their firms). Résumé.  Les auteurs analysent le rôle des rapports comptables externes, lorsqu'il s'agit de faciliter la décision, dans les marchés de capitaux importants dans lesquels les gestionnaires sont motivés à agir dans les meilleurs intérêts des investisseurs, sans que cela n'occasionne de coûts. Etant donné l'homogénéité des convictions, le renforcement des préférences dans le temps et une variété suffisante de créances négociables, il appert que les rapports comptables externes peuvent servir de base aux améliorations au sens de Pareto (relatives à la simple divulgation des dividendes) seulement si ces rapports permettent de prendre de meilleures décisions de production. Dans une grande économie, qui présente des risques tant à l'échelle de l'économie dans son ensemble qu'à l'échelle des entreprises particulières, ces améliorations semblent se produire si les rapports révèlent des événements qui touchent la productivité future de l'économie ou des entreprises particulières ou des événements qui donneront lieu à des gains ou à des pertes à l'échelle de l'économie. Toutefois, les rapports qui révèlent des gains ou des pertes éventuels particuliers à une entreprise n'ont pas de valeur, même s'ils sont susceptibles d'influer sur les prix du marché. En outre, bien que les ressources puissent être réparties de façon plus efficiente si les gestionnaires possèdent de l'information au sujet de la productivité de leur entreprise, l'économie peut réaliser ces gains d'efficience sans faire état aux investisseurs de l'information relative à la productivité particulière à l'entreprise, à condition que les investisseurs détiennent des portefeuilles de placements bien diversifiés et qu'ils soient au fait de la structure d'information et du critère de décision de chaque gestionnaire (qui consiste à maximiser la valeur de «l'information complète» relative à leur entreprise). 1988 Canadian Academic Accounting Association\u001b[0m :\n",

This study investigates the effects of decision framing in a social dilemma. Subjects, in groups of four or five persons, participated in a simulated social dilemma. Two factors were manipulated: decision framing (either in terms of giving to a collective good or taking from a collective good), and others’ behavior (whether other group members had apparently cooperated a little or a great deal on the first trial). Subjects conformed to others’ behavior when they could take from a collective good, but they diffused responsibility and acted contrary to others’ behavior when they could give to a public good. These results imply that models of choice behavior in social dilemmas should be expanded to include framing effects, as well as other departures from strict rationality. Moreover, the results suggest that findings from social dilemma research in which subjects can contribute to buy a public good may not be consistent with findings from studies in which subjects can take resources from a common pool. © 1988, Sage Publications.

      "Abstract: On most forecasting occasions forecasts are made for several successive periods, but decision-making models have traditionally neglected the impact of the potentially useful information contained in forecasts for periods beyond the initial period. The use and value of multiple-period forecasts are investigated here in the context of a recently developed dynamic model of the basic cost-loss ratio situation. We also extend previous studies of this model by examining the impacts - on forecast use and value - of assuming i) that weather events in successive periods are dependent and ii) that the forecasts of interest are expressed in probabilistic terms. In this regard, expressions are derived for the expected expenses associated with the use of climatological, imperfect (categorical or probabilistic) and perfect multiple-period forecasts under conditions of dependence and independence between events. -from Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We contrast the rational theory of choice in the form of expected utility theory with descriptive psychological analysis in the form of prospect theory, using problems involving the choice between political candidates and public referendum issues. The results showed that the assumptions underlying the classical theory of risky choice are systematically violated in the manner predicted by prospect theory. In particular, our respondents exhibited risk aversion in the domain of gains, risk seeking in the domain of losses, and a greater sensitivity to losses than to gains. This is consistent with the advantage of the incumbent under normal conditions and the potential advantage of the challenger in bad times. The results further show how a shift in the reference point could lead to reversals of preferences in the evaluation of political and economic options, contrary to the assumption of invariance. Finally, we contrast the normative and descriptive analyses of uncertainty in choice and address the rationality of voting. © 1988, American Political Science Association.

      "Abstract: A survey of 124 female baccalaureate nursing students (mean age 23 years) and 69 female registered nurses (mean age 31 years) focused on which part of their bodies would be most psychologically distressful for them to lose. Respondents answered this question in two ways: by means of open‐ended responses and then by selection from an alphabetized list. Limb(s), eye(s), and tongue were the most frequent choices for both groups of subjects. When queried about which loss would be least psychologically distressful for them, subjects in both groups most frequently named uterus (50% of nursing students and 78% of nurses). Uterus was the modal response although only 7 % of the students and 35 % of the nurses had children. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of body image, women's changing roles, and patient care. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Unemployment is a stressful life event that affects not only the job loser, but also impacts the person's social network. This network includes family members. However, most of the research on unemployment has focused on the effect of job loss on the former worker. This paper reviews this limited literature in order to identify what the potential impact of unemployment is on children. The reason for doing so is to add to the knowledge base that has demonstrated that economic policy decisions have a substantive effect on many aspects of societal health and wellbeing. Information on what these effects are in regard to children and families might serve to inform decision makers in developing appropriate social policy. This information is also an aid that would help professionals in the planning and delivering of needed services. © 1988.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Two studies were conducted to explore the cognitive and motivational aspects related to progression through the stages of intentional change in weight loss and control. Study I developed a Decisional Balance Measure for comparison of the positive and negative aspects of a decision to try to lose weight. Based on principal components analysis, item analysis, and coefficient alpha, 20 items were retained, 10 for each of two orthogonal scales labeled Pros and Cons. These two components accounted for 50% of the total variance. In Study II, the Pro, Con, and Pro-Con difference scores were compared across groups representing four stages in the change process: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Action, and Maintenance. External validity for the Decisional Balance Measure was provided by significant ANOVAs for the Pro and the Pro-Con scale scores, with the Action group showing the greatest imbalance of Pros over Cons. The combination of the decisional balance and stages of change models appears to offer a powerful tool for relating two important elements in an integrated theory of how change occurs naturally, and how it could be enhanced through planned treatment. © 1988 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the present study, a swindler had high versus low freedom of choice while deciding to commit a crime. He actually swindled Polish university students (involved observers) out of a large versus a small amount of money (high vs. low loss). Other students (noninvolved observers) were informed about the swindler's action. All students suggested the punishment that they believed the swindler deserved (the punishments chosen were used as an index of responsibility attribution). Involved students assigned more severe punishments than noninvolved students did. In the high-loss condition, involved observers were more punitive than they were in the low-loss condition. The judgments of the swindler's victims were determined by the magnitude of their loss; they ignored information about the swindler's freedom of choice. In contrast, the responsibility attributed by the noninvolved observers was influenced by the swindler's freedom of choice, but only in the low-loss condition. Noninvolved observers informed that the swindler had high freedom of choice were insensitive to information about the magnitude of the consequences for the victim. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

The firm's decisions about output rate and accident prevention activities are shown to be jointly determined by market demand, production cost and prospective accident loss data. Various institutional reasons are given for believing that, in the absence of government safety regulations, even a risk‐neutral management is likely to choose an excessively high probability of a Bhopal‐style disaster. In diesem Beitrag wird ein Modell der kurzfristigen Gewinnmaximierung für Indu‐strieunternehmungen entwickelt, deren Technologie die Gefahr von Katastrophen birgt. Die Entscheidungen der Unternehmung hinsichtiich Produktion und Unfall‐vorbeugung werden bestimmt durch Nachfrage, Produktionskosten und erwartete Folgekosten von Unfällen. Aus verschiedensten institutionellen Gründen dürfte sogar ein risikoneutrales Management ‐ bei Absenz staatlicher Sicherheitsvorschrif‐ten ‐ dazu neigen, eine aus gesellschaftlicher Sicht zu hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit einer bhopalartigen Katastrophe zu wählen. Cet article présente un modèle de maximisation du profit pour une entreprise industrielle qui met en ceuvre une technologie à très hauts risques. Les auteurs montrent que les décisions de l'entreprise concernant le taux de production et les activités de prévention des accidents sont déterminées conjointement par la demande du marché, les cou̧ts de production et les données prospectives de pertes d'exploitation consécutives aux accidents. Cet article fournit différents raisons institutionnelles pour penser qu'en l'absence de règlementations officielles de la sécurité, une direction d'entreprise neutre envers le risque choisira vraisemblablement une probabilityé extrèmement élevée vis‐à‐vis d'un désastre du style de celui de Bhopal.

      "Abstract: Early warning and control technologies offer prospective users the possibility of reducing both the magnitude of expected losses ('self insurance') and the probability of their occurence ('self protection'). In their seminal work Ehrich and Becker (1972) demonstrated that under certain conditions an optimal warning and control system should correspond to an interior point of the solution space. This paper demonstrates that there are alternative, plausible conditions for which risk neutral decision makers should choose an extremal solution - no protection at all or maximal feasible protection - and suggests an approximation procedure for the preliminary identification of such cases. © 1988.\u001b[0m :\n",

Half of the subjects were given the “chance of winning” each gamble, and half were given the “chance of losing” each gamble. Students' experience as gamblers was also recorded. Students generally responded more favorably to gambles when the probability information was phrased in positive terms than when it was phrased in negative terms. Males responded more favorably than females, and more experienced gamblers responded more favorably than less experienced gamblers.

      "Abstract: The concept of risk receives increasing attention in traffic safety research and control. However, there is much disagreement about the definition of the concept as well as about its importance. Sometimes, risk is defined statistically to provide a relative measure of safety (accident rates). Sometimes risk is used as a synonym for danger or threat. In this paper, the concept of risk is regarded as a synonym for expected loss, as defined in decision theory. This approach has several advantages. First, in the decision-theoretic model, risk is directly connected with the decisions that are taken by the individual road user. This approach also makes clearer the connection between individual risk and collective risk. Furthermore, the relation between individual behaviour and danger is not over-emphasized. Finally, the model is able to cope with the fundamental aspects of traffic behaviour, such as information sampling and processing, decision making and task performance. © 1988 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A modification of the procedure originally used by Davidson, Suppes, and Siegel (1956) to measure subjective utility was used to study the influence of positive affect on individuals' perceived value (utility) functions. Results indicated, as expected, that persons in whom positive affect had been induced showed a more negative subjective utility for losses than did controls. This indicates that losses seem worse to people who are feeling happy than to those in a control condition. The subjective utility functions of the two groups did not differ as much, however, when people were considering potential gain. Thus, at least in the situation tested in this study, potential gains did not seem to be more appealing (nor less so) for affect subjects than they did for controls. These findings are discussed in relation to theoretical issues in decision making and work suggesting that positive affect can promote increased sensitivity to losses in situations of potential meaningful loss.\u001b[0m :\n",

Ninety-six adults, representing four age cohorts, filled out a risk-taking questionnaire consisting of twelve situations demanding a choice between a safe and a risky option. One-half of the choices involved potential losses, the other half involved potential gains. The results indicated that older adults choose no more safe alternatives than do younger adults. Additionally, for all age cohorts, risk avoiding was more evident when choices were between risky and certain gains than when choices were between risky and certain losses. This pattern of responding suggests that older adults do not necessarily adopt a general strategy of avoiding risky options when a safe alternative is available.

This study examines the relative performance of four decision strategies under differing levels of task complexity. Some strategies are cognitively complex, while others employ simplifying procedures to reduce processing effort. Whether these reduced processing strategies result in less efficient decisions is therefore of interest. Decision accuracy and time taken to make a decision were assessed. Forty-eight professionals employed the strategies at three levels of task complexity. Repeated measures ANOVAs indicated that the more efficient decision makers were those who used a reduced processing strategy such as elimination by aspects when faced with a complex decision task. The decision makers achieved this efficiency by saving time, without losing decision accuracy. Implications and possible extensions of these results are discussed. © 1988.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The author has gathered data from Havik Brahmin women on depression. Cultural factors predisposing to depression are especially salient to this analysis. Beck's triad of negative self image, negative interpretation of life events, and negative view of the future is regarded as the cultural ideal for older women. With cultural changes including an increased marriage age, increased educational level, and increased decision-making for women Beck's triad is no longer culturally sanctioned. Although these cultural changes are recent and the sample is too small for a statistical analysis, the article concludes that there is a possible association between depression and cultural factors such as early marriage. Additional possible associations with depression reviewed in this paper are separation from important people. support systems, loss of parent at an early age, poor marital relationship, and the perception of helplessness.

      "Abstract: While regulation may not always be to business's benefit, it is likely to mean than costly requirements, increases in paperwork, decreases in innovation and the loss of business power. In responding to regulation, managers have choices. They can allow 'drift' to occur and not choose a policy. They can 'progressive' and 'lead the industry', or 'flight all the way' and 'do only what is required'. They can choose some combination of 'reaction and defence' and|or 'accomodation and proaction', or they can move from policy to policy depending on the issue, the competitive implications, the power of key participants and the other factors. Each of these responses has a unique array of advantages and disadvantages. To decide on a strategy, strategic analysis is needed. Such analysis requires: (1) attention to internal operating impacts; (2) concern for relative competitive impacts on an industry-wide basis; (3) concern for relative competitive impacts within an industry; and (4) assessment of regulatory alternatives in light of corporate goals. Attention to these concerns is necessary to refine, tailor and adjust a company's particular response to regulatory challenges. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We have indicated how budgetgames played by a representative sample of voters can be used to estimate the marginal social demand for mixed public goods. A model has been developed that enables us to distinguish between private and social demand considerations of the players. Information on marginal social demand is obtained by comparing the actual outcome of the game with a simulated game solution based on the optimization of private benefits only. This optimization problem is shown to be approximately equivalent to a linear programming problem in which each respondent minimizes the loss of subsidies on his consumption of the mixed public goods considered. Empirical results show the largest marginal social demand for public services for the elderly, followed by mental health care, primary and secondary education and higher education. A negative marginal social demand is expressed for in-patient health care, police and justice, outpatient health care and culture and recreation, the latter service having the smallest social demand. An unexpected result is the relatively large marginal social demand for higher education. Although this service is severly cut in the actual game, this outcome mainly derives from small private benefits to the average voter. Therefore, the usual interpretation of budgetgames - that identifies heavy budget cuts with small social demand - underestimates the social demand for higher education. The reverse is true for general in-patient health care. Although this service is moderately cut in the actual game, this result mainly derives from the large private benefits to the average voter. In this case the usual interpretation of the game overestimates social demand. We have also studied the dependence of the marginal social demand pattern on the political orientation of the voters. Apart from typical pure or almost pure public goods such as defence, general government and police and justice services - clearly favoured by right-wing voters - we find no strong dependence on political orientation. We think the presented approach is a step towards the measurement of social demand for mixed public goods using stated voter preferences in a well-defined budgetgame framework. Such a direct approach seems to be a useful complement to the indirect revealed preferences approach, which faces large theoretical and empirical problems due to the required complex models of collective decisionmaking. We also have shown the importance of the explicit incorporation of private benefit considerations in the interpretation of budgetgames. The latter are indispensable when correct conclusions on the social demand for mixed public goods are to be drawn from such games. Future research should include the study of possible biases introduced by different designs of budgetgames, as well as more refined procedures for the estimation of private and social demand for public goods from budgetgame solutions. © 1987 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Tversky and Kahneman (1981, Science, 211, 453-458) reported that the choice between two decision alternatives of equal expected value, differing only in the degree of risk, was significantly influenced by the \"framing\" of the alternative decision outcomes. When alternative outcomes were phrased \"positively\" in terms of lives saved, subjects preferred the risk-averse alternative. When outcomes were phrased \"negatively\" in terms of lives lost, the risk-seeking option was preferred. Experiment 1 investigated the robustness of the framing effect and its remediation by formal training. Forty-five MBA students responded to a decision problem before and after training in decision theory. Results differed from those published by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) in two respects. First, although results in the positive framing condition were similar to Tversky and Kahneman's results, no preference for the risky option in the negative framing condition was observed. Consequently, no framing effect was found even on the pretest. Second, many students reported being indifferent to the two options. No significant changes occurred after training. Experiment 2 replicated these results on a nonbusiness sample. These findings suggest that (a) unidentified factors affect whether a framing effect is observed, and (b) the bias known as the framing effect may not be as robust as has been believed. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper addressed the question, is there a momentum effect in decision-making groups? That is, does movement toward a decision alternative encourage further similar movement? In the first two of three experiments, the movement of group members toward or away from a subject's preference was manipulated while holding constant the content of group discussion. The only significant effect of such shifts in position was an antimomentum effect; e.g., subjects were less likely to move toward an alternative which had gained a supporter than if no such shift in position had occurred. These experiments also demonstrated that the inverse relationship between overall level of support and likelihood of changing one's position (the \"strength-in-numbers\" effect) was not solely attributable to larger factions' ability to generate more arguments than smaller factions. In a final experiment, subjects were given an opportunity to defend their preference; under these conditions, the loss of a supporter might result in momentum-producing attributions (e.g., my arguments are unconvincing). However, these experimental conditions did not produce a momentum effect. Analyses of the content of subjects' speech paralleled the data on opinion change in these and previous studies-subjects were much more sensitive to current levels of support than to changes in the level of support. The antimomentum effect observed in Experiment 2 was attributed to a sensitivity to both one's current and past levels of support in the group. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

Recallfidelity increased with deeper levels of detail, with an attendant loss in information comprehensiveness.

As elderly residents' health declines, they experience an illness career descent. This refers to the movement through the social structure of the healthcare facility as a consequence of the downward trajectory of chronic illness. Illness career descent requires the formal relocation of the individual and the informal social consequences of loss of control, stigmatization, and segregation from prior friendship networks. Individuals react in a three-stage manner. At first, residents resist being moved \"down.\" Next, there is a negative impact on their self-image as relocated residents accept the evaulation by staff that they have become less competent. Third, they adjust to their new location and enhance their self-image by developing new roles, finding a \"poor dear,\" re-evaluating prior stereotypes, and engaging in post-decisional dissonance reduction. © 1987 Human Sciences Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospect theory (PT) (D. Kahneman & A. Tversky, 1979, Econometrica, 47, 263-291) assumes that monetary outcomes are coded as gains and losses and that the value function for money is S shaped and steeper for losses. PT also predicts a reflection effect-preferences among strictly positive prospects are reversed when the gains are converted to equivalent losses. It was hypothesized that as a result of these effects subjects who are (in)transitive in the domain of gains would reflect their choices and behave (in)transitively in the domain of losses as well. The hypothesis was tested in a within-subject design using modified versions of the gambles from A. Tversky's (1969), (Psychological Review, 76, 31-48) study of intransitivity and Kahneman and Tversky's (1979) exposition of PT. The results provide strong empirical support for the reflection effect and shape of the value function hypothesized by PT and demonstrate an equal number of violations of transitivity for gains and losses. As predicted, most (in)transitive subjects in the domain of gains were also (in)transitive in the domain of losses. Furthermore, for most transitive subjects the preference ranking of the negative gambles was an exact mirror image of the comparable scale for positive prospects. However, the hypothesis that intransitive triples would also be reflected was not supported. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

The results of our study give additional support to the gain‐loss theory and to the expectation states theory, which is the broader context within which the gain‐loss extension was developed. Our results also indicate the need for the reconceptualization of the subjective probability of a correct response. Copyright © 1987 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In Becker's model, punishment is not constrained by a normative 'socially acceptable' level. Carr-Hill and Stern show that the justice system requires a concept of 'appropriate' punishment which places either an upper bound on punishment or a cost of deviating from the 'appropriate' penalty. We estimate the social loss function implicitly minimized by police intake officers' processing of juvenile offenders. The calculation of social cost appears to ignore both the private costs of punishment and the seriousness of the crime. This suggests that concepts of rights and appropriate penalties affect decisions and provide a nonbinding upper bound on punishment. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated that subjects who receive positively framed information evaluate decision options more favorably than do other subjects who receive the same information framed negatively. This study examines whether the initial frame continues to influence responses of a given subject even after the frame is changed. In separate sequentially administered booklets, subjects were presented a series of gambles expressed in terms of probability of winning (positive condition), probability of losing (negative condition), or both (mixed condition). Subjects indicated whether they would take each ganble and rated their confidence in each decision Between-subjects analyses based on only the first condition received by each subject revealed a significant framing effect. Evaluations were most favorable in the positive condition and least favorable in the negative condition. Within-subject analyses based on all three conditions received by each subject revealed no significant framing effect. The effect of the initial frame apparently perseveres despite subsequent changes in the frame. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An unusual design was adopted for a trial comparing selective local excision and simple vulvectomy for vulvar carcinoma in situ. In view of the grave disfigurement entailed by vulvectomy and the pilot study finding that no malignant recurrences developed following local excision, a conventional comparative design was deemed unethical. Instead, all patients will be allocated to local excision as long as no malignant recurrences develop. Should one occur, the trial may switch to a comparative stage, depending on the information then accumulated. Otherwise, evidence will accrue indicating that local excision is the superior treatment. In defining 'superiority' one must assess the loss associated with disfigurement, on the one hand, and that associated with malignancy on the other: ratios between decision-theoretic loss quantities such as these define the pertinent null hypothesis of equal treatment merits and allow the expected loss to future patients caused by rival designs to be calculated. As shown by this example, loss considerations are indispensable in the design of clinical trials, as are prior distributions for the unknown parameters. Likewise, loss considerations ought to guide the subsequent statistical analysis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Ten years ago an academic group was established in Cardiff to determine why the public make life-style choices which are known to have an adverse impact on health and also to develop methods of measurement which describe trends in positive health motivation (salience) in the community. Three stages of this research are described in this paper and the results reveal a complex and fascinating set of human beliefs, attitudes and behaviours. Concern for health was not a consistent human characteristic and there was little evidence for the existence of a general preventive orientation in the cohorts studied. Discrepancies between expressed health beliefs/attitudes and behaviours are more explicable when the reality of ambiguity and paradox is recognized in human responses. Human responses to loss (grief) may have similarities to the respondents' experiences when facing a possible change of life-style for health reasons. The practical implications for primary care professionals are discussed. © 1987, Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Two alternative health strategies are defined for Ghana and evaluated, over a range of discount rates from 0 to 20%, with regard to the present value of productive life saved. It is found that the relative ranking of the projects is sensitive to the choice of discount rates. The sensitivity of disease rankings to the underlying morbidity and fatality rates is also examined and the results underline the importance of obtaining better epidemiological baseline data and information on project effectiveness if the potential usefulness of the healthy days of life approach to project evaluation is to be fully realized. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

An individual contemplating migration must consider the loss of some or all of the benefits of family membership. The extent of the loss depends on the family's willingness and ability to continue to provide services to the migrant.

The design included four limbs involving two inclusion relations, thumb-hand and foot-leg, and two viewpoints involving consequences for one-self or for others. The results indicated that subjects generate more numerous consequences for primary than for secondary consequences, more for short-term consequences than for medium- or long-term ones, more for an inclusive limb than for an included limb (e.g., hand vs thumb), and more pertaining to one-self than to others. Individual differences in the generation of consequences were not associated with prior experience involving functional loss of the limbs tested or with general differences in academic performance.

      "Abstract: For Homart Development Company, one of the most important strategic issues is scheduling divestiture of shopping malls and office buildings. In the 1986 strategic plan, 170 assets were analyzed for possible divestiture over 10 years. The problem is complicated by requirements imposed by the parent corporation, Sears, Roebuck and Company, that Homart meet a minimum aggregate return on equity each year. All divestiture decisions are linked with these constraints. An integer programming model designed especially for problems of this structure was developed and coded. The first run of the model resulted in an additional profit of 440 million compared to the performance of the traditional techniques for solving the problem. Since the problems addressed by this model were strategic, results of the model changed the implemented policies at Homart's highest level of decision making. In particular, policies toward sales of assets at a loss and the relationships between shopping malls and office buildings were changed as a direct result of the model.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A real-time neural network model, called affective balance theory, is developed to explain many properties of decision making under risk that heretofore have been analyzed using formal algebraic models, notably prospect theory. The model describes cognitive-emotional interactions that are designed to ensure adaptive responses to environmental demands but whose emergent properties nonetheless can lead to paradoxical and even irrational decisions in risky environments. Emotional processing in the model is carried out by an opponent processing network called a gated dipole. Learning enables cognitive representations to generate affective reactions of the dipole. Habituating chemical transmitters within a gated dipole determine an affective adaptation level, or context, against which later events are evaluated. Neutral events can become affectively charged either through direct activations or antagonistic rebounds within a previously habituated dipole. The theory describes the affective consequences of strategies in which an individual compares pairs of events or statements that are not necessarily explicitly grouped within the stimuli. The same preference orders may sometimes, but not always, emerge from different sequences of pair-wise alternatives. The role of short-term memory updating and expectancy-modulated matching processes in regulating affective reactions is described. The formal axioms of prospect theory are dynamically explicated through this analysis. Analyses of judgments of the utility of a single alternative, choices between pairs of regular alternatives, choices between riskless and risky alternatives, and choices between pairs of risky alter-natives lead to explanations of such phenomena as preference reversals, the gambler's fallacy, the framing effect, and the tendency toward risk aversion when gains are involved but risk taking when losses are involved. These explanations illustrate that data concerning decision making under risk may now be related to data concerning the dynamics of conditioning, cognition, and emotion as consequences of a single psychophysiological theory. © 1987 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The increasing number of corporate computer failures and crimes has forced managers to tighten controls of their Electronic Data Processing systems. However, the costs of an exhaustive program of controls are often inordinately expensive, and the effectiveness of such an operation is not necessarily guaranteed. Assuming that managers have limited time and capital resources, a comprehensive and formalized methodology is considered essential to assess vulnerability of computer systems, determine acceptable levels of potential losses, and identify cost-effective control strategies. This paper presents a Cost-Effectiveness Model (CEM) that determines an optimal program for control of EDP systems. The Cost-Effectiveness Model has been implemented in Pascal as a microcomputer-based Decision Support System (DSS). The CEM-DSS is geared to help the EDP manager: (i) identify alternative sets of control activities, (ii) evaluate and choose the most preferred set, and (iii) monitor and upgrade the security of EDP systems frequently. © 1974.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons react to form atmospheric ozone, but, for given concentrations of either one, increasing amounts of the other give rise to declining increments of ozone. Thus, the damage functions from hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions are non-convex. A case study of control strategies in the New York metropolitan regions show that, because control costs rise so steeply for both pollutants, a cost-effective approach is to control emissions of both, despite the non-convexities. However, the loss function, for deviations from the least-cost strategy, lies well within the range of scientific uncertainty regarding precursor-ozone relationships, and the least-cost strategy choice is highly sensitive to small changes in the relative control costs. Therefore, decisions regarding controls on these emissions, especially nitrogen oxide emissions, should be based also on other considerations, such as the reduction in acid deposition. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

The self-induced and self-escalating addictive crisis leading up to that choice is explored, as is the crisis caused by the loss of the gambling itself. It is proposed that gambling provides the gambler with action, a method of dealing with stress aand avoiding unpleasant affect, and a variety of social, psychological, and existential benefits. The loss of gambling is seen as a complicated and significant one which elicits grief responses similar to those seen in response to other types of major loss. It is proposed that in the individual outpatient treatment of pathological gamblers, the therapist helps the recovering gambler to accept the loss of the gambling and learn to live a rewarding life without it. Four phases of treatment are suggested which correspond to stages of grieving and accepting the loss of the gambling. © 1986 Human Sciences Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Conventional economic theory assumes that people are uniformly risk averse. Psychological studies, however, have shown that people are sometimes risk averse for gains but risk seeking for losses, a phenomenon termed the reflection effect. The robustness of the reflection effect was examined both within subjects and across subjects differing in risk style for a set of multi-outcome lotteries. Reflection was found to be weak and irregular for all choice pairs except those that included a lottery with a riskless component. The latter were generally preferred for gains but not for losses by both risk-averse and risk-seeking subjects. In all other choices, risk-averse and risk-seeking subjects differed systematically from one another, but in ways that are more complex than pure risk aversion or risk seeking would predict. The findings suggest a general inability of weighted value theories such as prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) to adequately describe the pattern of risk preferences over individuals and over the full range of lottery types. Such inadequacy suggests the need for an alternative approach to risk with emphasis on the goals and strategies that individuals bring to the risky choice process. © 1986 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

Whereas traditional hypothesis tests cannot always serve the needs of the practitioner who needs to make a decision, a problem formulation that assigns losses to various incorrect decisions offers several advantages. With three possible decisions this approach offers a precise representation of the pragmatic and explanatory views of decision making. It enables the investigator to incorporate in the problem specification his attitudes about the seriousness of various errors by guiding him, before he sees the data, to a choice of asymmetric tail probabilities. It also suggests a reformulation of the P‐value that can accommodate some of the difficulties practitioners face. Copyright © 1987 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Data analysis leads to the following main conclusions: (a) subjects' behavior on the gain side and their behavior on the loss side are totally unrelated, which fact in particular suffices to disprove the \"reflection effect\" hypothesis proposed by Kahneman and Tversky; (b) conventional, model independent definitions of risk attitudes are inadequate; (c) on the gain side, subjects generally take the exact probabilities of the events into account, whereas on the loss side, they appear to have recourse only to coarser categories of plausibility; (d) correlatively, on the gain side, subjects discriminate between situations of risk and of uncertainty and are, on the whole, pessimists, whereas on the loss side, they do not differentiate between those two situations. © 1987.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, such effects have yet to be examined wherein groups negotiate agreements from a continuum of risky alternatives. A total of 26 teams of Master of Business Administration (MBA) students in Experiment 1, and 12 teams of professional buyers in Experiment 2, were assigned to one of two conditions in a bargaining task. Condition 1 teams, presented with payoff tables showing chances of obtaining net profits, were induced to think of potential gains (a positive frame). Condition 2 teams, presented with chances of incurring expenses, were induced to think of potential reduced losses (a negative frame). The potential profit in both conditions was held constant. Bargaining teams thinking \"a gain is at stake\" were hypothesized to make less risky bargaining agreements than opposing teams thinking \"a loss-reduction is at stake.\" This hypothesis was supported.

      "Abstract: In this study, we examine hypotheses, based on theories of group decision making and an extension of prospect theory to a social context, about the influence of group communication and group decision processes on group decisions. Managers individually and in 3-person groups made multiattribute risk choices (two investment alternatives, each with multiple outcomes). Two group decisions were reached during face-to-face discussion, and two were reached during (real-time) computer-mediated discussion. In comparison with prediscussion individual preferences, groups' multiattribute risk choices and attitudes after face-to-face discussion were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses, a tendency predicted by prospect theory and consistent with choice shift and other group extremitization research. By contrast, group decisions during computer-mediated discussion did not shift in the direction of prospect theory predictions. The results are consistent with persuasive-arguments theory, in that computer-mediated discussion contained less argumentation than face-to-face discussion. Social decision schemes were used to evaluate alternative assumptions about the group process. A \"(prospect-theory) norm-wins\" decision scheme described group choice well in the face-to-face discussion condition, but not in the computer-mediated discussion condition. Another decision scheme, first-advocate wins, which described choices well in both face-to-face and computer-mediated discussions, was explored in a discussion of the role of communication in group decision making. © 1987 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

The factor of responsibility was manipulated and the experiment was repeated in a private-enterprise setting. Results indicated that in public-context conditions, responsible subjects allocated significantly less money than did nonresponsible subjects, although this was not the case in private-context conditions.

      "Abstract: Abstract.  This paper analyzes the incentive effects of alternative legal systems on the auditor's decision making process. The first system, termed strict liability, holds the auditor liable whenever there is a loss, and the second system, termed negligence, holds the auditor liable for losses arising from the auditor's deviation from a prescribed due care standard. The auditor is assumed to have ex ante limited knowledge of the financial state of the client and the standard setting process. He revises his beliefs on the client's financial state based on a costless signal that may be interpreted as an internal audit report. The analysis shows that signal “quality” and auditor's perception of the client's financial state jointly determine the level of liability required to induce the auditor to adopt a socially optimal due care level. As in Simon's (1982) Model, negligence with supplementary insurance is preferred to strict liability. Further, negligence is shown to operate with less information than strict liability, in contrast to models such as Green (1978) and Shavell (1978). Résumé.  Cet article analyse les effets incitatifs de systèmes juridiques alternatifs sur le processus décisionnel du vérificateur. Le premier système, dit de responsabilité stricte, considère le vérificateur responsable à chaque fois qu'il y a une perte, et le deuxième système, dit de négligence, considère le vérificateur responsable des pertes résultant de sa déviance d'une norme prescrite. Le vérificateur est supposé posséder ex ante une connaissance limitée de la situation financière du client ainsi que du processus de normalisation. Il révise ses opinions portant sur la situation financière du client à la lumière d'un signal sans frais qui peut être assimilé à un rapport de vérification interne. L'analyse montre qu'un signal «qualité» ainsi que la perception du vérificateur quant à la situation financière du client déterminent conjointement le niveau de responsabilité requis pour inciter le vérificateur à retenir un niveau de soin raisonnable socialement optimal. De même que le modèle de Simon (1982), le système de négligence avec assurances additionnelles est préféré à la responsabilité stricte. De plus, il est montré que le système de négligence fonctionne avec moins d'information que le système de responsabilité stricte, par opposition à d'autres modèles tels Green (1978) et Shavell (1978). 1986 Canadian Academic Accounting Association\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The chapter presents a series of demonstrations in which seemingly inconsequential changes in the formulation of choice problems caused significant shifts of preference. The inconsistencies were traced to the interaction of two sets of factors: variation in the framing of acts, contingencies and outcomes, and the characteristic non-linearities of values and decision weights. The demonstrated effects are large and systematic, although by no means universal. They occur when the outcomes concern the loss of human lives as well as in choices about money; they are not restricted to hypothetical questions and are not eliminated by monetary incentives. The chapter is concerned primarily with the descriptive question of how decisions are made and emphasizes that the psychology of choice is also relevant to the normative question of how decisions ought to be made. The framing of acts and outcomes can also reflect the acceptance or rejection of responsibility for particular consequences, and the deliberate manipulation of framing is commonly used as an instrument of self-control. When framing influences the experience of consequences, the adoption of a decision frame is an ethically significant act. © 1986, Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We present an expected utility criterion for setting targets or finding estimates under uncertainty that subsumes expected opportunity loss criteria popular in the context of inventory, contract, supply, and investment decisions. In contrast to a classical approach of defining the utility nu on the outcome space X, the present utility u is defined on the product of the state space R and the decision (target) space A, with R equals A. Modeling of u is based on (i) structural analysis of preferences, and (ii) behavioral hypotheses concerning relative risk attitude and its susceptibility to the framing of the state as either 'above-target' or 'below-target'. A piecewise approximation of u on R multiplied by A is given in terms of a cardinal value function on A satisfying a directed preference difference axiomatization, two conditional von Neumann-Morgenstern utility functions on R, and two scaling constants. Conditions on risk attitude are established. A comparison of nu with u in light of the reflection phenomenon reveals a paradox; its implications for decision analyses are discussed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The chapter describes a simple economic model that predicts in a qualitative way on how costs (lost feeding opportunity and risk) interact to produce an optimal flight distance from approaching predators. Animals often defer the decision to flee from an approaching predator and continue with their ongoing activities. The view is that, a profitable approach to the problem of why such decisions are deferred, and how they are eventually made, is to view the process as an economic, one in which the relative costs of fleeing and staying change as a predator approaches. It is suggested that the economic approach will prove useful in analyzing many aspects of predator-prey interactions. © 1986 Academic Press Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Optimization techniques developed for physical and engineering systems are often applied to the control of economic systems. The objective functional of the controller (e.g., the government) is minimized given a passive economic system. However, as Lucas (1976) has stressed, an economy is not a passive system. In an economy there are, in general, several independently acting controllers. The actions of these controllers depend on their expectations with respect to the actions of the other decision-makers. Forward-looking expectations ruin the standard non-anticipation property of a system. As Kydland and Prescott (1977) have noticed the optimal policy is time inconsistent. Kydland and Prescott (1977) came more or less to the conclusion that the optimal control approach as such was under reconsideration. Later on, however, it became the common idea that the optimal control approach had to be placed in a game theory framework. The revival of dynamic game theory in economic literature was a fact. The famous result of Simaan and Cruz (1973) that Bellman's principle of optimality does not generalize to the Stackelberg solution became known as time inconsistency. What is actually the problem? The answer to this question has a technical side and a conceptual side. Technically speaking the problem is that dynamic programming can not be used to find the closed-loop no-memory Stackelberg solution. Conceptually speaking the problem is that the global Stackelberg, decision model yields policies which become suboptimal in the course of the game when reoptimizing is allowed for: in the future there can be an incentive to change the policy which was originally established. Furthermore, it is hard to defend a decision model in which the follower believes such a time-inconsistent announcement of the leader. The Stackelberg solution concept is a sequential concept: the players act one after another. The follower knows the action of the leader when he acts himself. However, the follower does not know the leader's future actions. He has to decide on the basis of the leader's announcement. Incentives to cheat arise for the leader because of the time inconsistency. Two solutions can be distinguished. Firstly, the follower believes the announcement and the leader does not cheat or reoptimize. This situation results in the global Stackelberg outcome. Secondly, a reoptimization in the future is to be expected. This outcome has to be consistent. That is to say, a future reoptimization will not lead to change in policy. Otherwise the announcement will not be believed. The feedback stagewise Stackelberg solution, which is found by means of dynamic programming, is consistent by construction. It is also possible to formulate a consistent open-loop Stackelberg solution. The reputation of the government plays an important role here. It is an interesting idea to try to formalize the concept of reputation [see e.g. Kreps and Wilson (1982) and Barro and Gordon (1983)]. In dynamic finite horizon games the loss of reputation in the course of the game can be formalized by an end-penalty. It is important to note that these problematic aspects of the Stackelberg concept can also occur in a game where the players have to perform their actions at the same time. One of the players (e.g., the government) can try to become a Stackelberg leader by announcing his policy before it is actually played. In this type of game additional incentives to cheat arise! Generally, the leader can gain by cheating on his announcement at the time of action. It is reasonable to assume that the effect of cheating will be that the follower will not believe the announcements anymore. Three solutions can be distinguished. Firstly, the follower believes the announcement and the leader does not cheat or reoptimize. This situation results again in the Stackelberg outcome. Secondly, a reoptimization in the future is to be expected. This outcome has to be consistent. Finally, cheating is expected. In this case the announcement has to be 'cheating-proof'. Therefore it is necessary, but not sufficient, that the announcement is consistent. It will be shown that the Nash concept seems to be the only reasonable concept for this game. For this reason the Nash announcement can be called a credible announcement. When cheating is not expected, but occurs anyhow, several outcomes are possible. For example, the follower believes the announcement, consistent or not, but the leader cheats on his announcement. It is reasonable to assume that after this has happened the follower stops believing. All possible outcomes have to be evaluated by the leader against his expected loss of reputation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the impact of the information structure on the outcome of Nash and Stackelberg games. The terminology is briefly summarized and some examples are given. Some papers [e.g., Backus and Driffill (1985)] jump very quickly from an open-loop Stackelberg framework to a feedback stagewise or dynamic -programming framework in order to achieve consistency. It is true that the feedback stagewise solution concept has very nice properties (like sub-game perfectness). It presupposes, however, information on the state of the system. A change in information structure should not be justified alone on the strive for time consistency. Section 3 elaborates on announcements, consistency and cheating. A simple linear quadratic example is used for illustration. Definitions and propositions are brought together in an appendix. © 1986.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It has been argued in previous studies that the expected utility decision criterion provides useful insights for certain insurance problems, such as underwriting, reinsurance and portfolio optimization problems. In this study three new models are developed which extend and generalize previous results. The first model analyses modified stop-loss reinsurance. The second model analyses risk pooling where both inward and outward reinsurance occur. Expected utility calculations can be used to provide insight on the attractiveness of competing reinsurance and risk pooling options. The third model is for strategic planning, where risk/reward tradeoffs for all the insurer's business activities (underwriting, investment, reinsurance) can be considered in aggregate. The simpler models can often be solved analytically however the strategic planning model is relatively complex and uses Monte Carlo techniques to determine retained earnings distributions. The expected utility approach has been found to be powerful, flexible and comprehensive as a decision aiding mechanism. From a normative viewpoint, this approach accounts very well for all the important decision elements. Recent developments in decision support systems will allow these models to be made available to practitioners in user friendly forms. © 1986, International Actuarial Association.

Findings support the contention that because opportunity costs often are ignored, setback decisions may be framed as choices between certain losses and the possibility of larger or no losses. Making opportunity costs more explicit alters the framing of such decisions and leads to decisions which more closely mirror traditional cost/benefit prescriptions. © 1986.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We investigated whether people are biased in their evaluations of gambling outcomes even when the outcomes are chance determined. In Experiment 1, subjects exhibited a bias in their evaluations of the outcomes of a computerized bingo game. Manipulating whether the outcome of the first round was determined by a series of anomalous or \"fluke\" events had a greater impact on the subsequent bets of those who had lost their bets than on those who had won. Losers appeared to use these fluke events to explain away the outcome, whereas winners discounted their significance. Experiment 2 tested the limiting conditions of these findings by manipulating whether or not subjects were induced to perceive an \"illusion of control\" over the outcomes by allowing some of them to make a series of incidental choices during the contest. Only those subjects in the illusion of control conditions exhibited a bias in their evaluations of the outcome of the first round. The connection between this research and earlier behavioral theories of the psychology of gambling is discussed. © 1986.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A cross-sectional study carried out among 269 mother-infant pairs in Istanbul showed that the majority of infants began receiving regular complements or had been weaned before the age of three months. A prospective study carried out among 24 mothers beginning the last month of pregnancy and continuing until the time when regular complementation was instituted showed that the average duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 58 days. Infants began receiving complements on an irregular basis beginning the early postnatal days. Irregularly introduced complements often lead to gastro-intestinal reactions and weight loss. Mothers displayed sensitivity toward cues that suggested dissatisfaction in infants or other events that they conceived as threats to their milk yield in terms of quality and quantity. Mothers often discussed their decision to introduce complements with other people such as doctors and older female acquaintances who supported them toward complementation. Failure to gain sufficient weight with exclusive breastfeeding was seldom the cause of introducing complementary feeding. © 1986 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents a general decision model for quantitative risk analysis to help in solving the problem of setting the optimal exposure level of a potential carcinogen in regulatory decision-making. This model consists of a probability function and two loss functions. The probability function describes the dose-response relationship for a potential carcinogen at various exposure levels. The two loss functions include (1) the cost of using a potential carcinogen, e.g., health loss, and (2) the cost of not using the compound, e.g., economic loss. Using the principle of minimum expected loss, a fundamental formula for setting the optimal beneficial dose level is derived. The formula equates the probability function to a ratio of loss functions. The general form of loss functions is described in the paper. Under certain conditions, the current approach for quantitative risk assessment is a special situation of this general model. © 1986.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents new developments and illustrations of the introduction of risk and costs in cost‐benefit analysis for new dams. The emphasis is on a method of evaluation of the risk costs based on the structure of the local economy. Costs to agricultural property as well as residential, commercial, industrial, and public property are studied in detail. Of particular interest is the case of sequential dam failure and the evaluation of the risk costs attributable to a new dam upstream from an existing one. Three real cases are presented as illustrations of the method: the Auburn Dam, the Dickey‐Lincoln School Project, and the Teton Dam, which failed in 1976. This last case provides a calibration tool for the estimation of loss ratios. For these three projects, the risk‐modified benefit‐cost ratios are computed to assess the effect of the risk on the economic performance of the project. The role of a warning system provided by systematic monitoring of the dam is analyzed: by reducing the risk costs, the warning system attenuates their effect on the benefit‐cost ratio. The precursors, however, can be missed or misinterpreted: monitoring does not guarantee that the risks to human life can be reduced to zero. This study shows, in particular, that it is critical to consider the risk costs in the decision to build a new dam when the flood area is large and densely populated.

      "Abstract: This paper presents estimates of life years and working years lost from alcohol-related premature death in 1983. It is then suggested that since lives saved or changes in the quality of life are outcomes of health care policies, measures of the value of life and quality of life years saved are needed for economic evaluation and efficient decision-making. Three methods of valuing life are outlined and ways of measuring the quality of life years gained from health care interventions are discussed. These methods are still at an early stage of development and are intrinsically complex and contentious. Nevertheless, it is argued that all outcomes of health policies need to be measured in order to make more efficient health care decisions. The estimate of life years lost from alcohol-related premature death presented in this paper is one indicator of the magnitude of this aspect of social cost. An important and natural extension is to assess the outcomes of policies aimed at reducing the number of premature deaths. Such research would greatly improve our knowledge of alcohol misuse and the effects of policies used to alleviate its associated problems. © 1985 Medical Council on Alcoholism.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: There is evidence that the losing behavior of pathological gamblers may be purposeful. In this paper, I argue that they may lose in order to fulfill a loser script. The script is a decision, or series of decisions, made early in life to accommodate to parents perceived as threatening and omnipotent. The decision, once made, is carried, unwittingly, into later life and is re-enacted repeatedly. The pathological gambler may lose to fulfill parental expectations that he or she has decided to adopt as his or her own. Because the loser script is a decision, or series of decisions, it can be redecided. This is best done with the help of a potent therapist, who is perceived as stronger than the original threatening parents, and in group therapy, wherein group members support one another in the redecision process. © 1985 Human Sciences Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One of the most significant and unique features in Kahneman and Tversky's approach to choice under uncertainty is aversion to loss realization. This paper is concerned with two aspects of this feature. First, we place this behavior pattern into a wider theoretical framework concerning a general disposition to sell winners too early and hold losers too long. This framework includes other elements, namely mental accounting, regret aversion, self‐control, and tax considerations. Second, we discuss evidence which suggests that tax considerations alone cannot explain the observed patterns of loss and gain realization, and that the patterns are consistent with a combined effect of tax considerations and the three other elements of our framework. We also show that the concentration of loss realizations in December is not consistent with fully rational behavior, but is consistent with our theory. 1985 The American Finance Association\u001b[0m :\n",

We investigated the case of control decisions and examined the hypothesis that Type As would be less willing than Type Bs to relinquish control to another person. On an initial 20-trial reaction-time task, Type A and Type B men received feedback about their own performance and about that of a partner. The feedback indicated equal or superior performance by the partner. On a subsequent replication of the task in which only one person could work on any one trial, Type As relinquished fewer trials to their partners than did Type Bs, particularly when the partner had exhibited a superior initial performance.

      "Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for and problems inherent in the prevention of stress resulting from technological catastrophe. Baum, Fleming, and Davidson's (1983) characterization of technological disaster is reviewed. These accidents, which involve the breakdown or failure of human-made systems, differ from other types of disaster in their psychological impact. These differences are particularly important in accidents involving hazardous substances including radiation and chemical toxins. The continuing threat of future illness resulting from exposure to radiation and toxins contributes to feelings of uncertainty; and the fact that the accident resulted from a failure of human-made systems means it is likely to be perceived as a loss rather than a lack of control. Because of their unique features, technological catastrophies are likely to result in long term effects including chronic stress in exposed populations. Because failures of human-made systems would be prevented if the problem was foreseen and preventable, prevention concerns center around reducing stress where possible. Three domains of prevention activity are described. First, assessments aimed at predicting the stress inducing and reducing impact of intervention strategies can contribute to decisions about how to handle the accident once it has occurred. Second, some of the policy implications of these events are described. Finally, the ethics of stress reducing interventions in settings where a real danger is present are discussed. © 1985 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Conflicts among nations can often be understood as games in which players (nations) possessing strategies (the sets of actions they may take) face alternative consequences (loss or gain of territory or prestige) determined by their choices of action. Amenable to this type of analysis is the recent Falkland Islands crisis involving Argentina and Great Britain. The events in this case provide an illustration of the way “three‐stage, two‐person sequential game tree models” can explain the outcome of a crisis situation, whether the parties involved possess perfect information regarding the likely actions of their opponents or are subject to misperceptions about them. When misperceptions occur, the effects can be severely detrimental to both players. Under certain conditions a single misperception by a player of an opponent's preferences can lead to conflict even though both players would have preferred another outcome, one that would in fact have resulted if the error in perception had not occurred. Thus, the outcome of such a “game” is highly sensitive not only to the players' actual preferences but to mutual perceptions of those preferences.

Using techniques of decision analysis and available data on sequelae, it was found that gains in life expectancy and quality of life can be expected when women ages 30-60 undergo hysterectomy for benign neoplasm, disorders of menstruation, acquired abnormal anatomy, cervical disease, or endometriosis, owing primarily to prevention of reproductive tract cancers, which outweighs the impact of operative mortality. However, women who have relatively high operative risk or low expected cancer risks, beyond thresholds estimated in sensitivity analyses, suffer losses in life expectancy. Women younger than 35 not treated with replacement estrogens following hysterectomy and oophorectomy can expect net losses in life expectancy with surgical intervention due to increased risks of heart disease and osteoporosis. For women in the reproductive years who wish to preserve their potential to bear children, sterilization may be an unacceptable consequence of elective hysterectomy in the quality of life. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present paper introduces a method to study human behavior-choice under a given environment. The situation was that of a simulation game using a microcomputer. The environment consisted of mutually exclusive three environmental states : “ENEMY”, “POWER” and “NONE”. In order to survive, the subjects had to maximize the points gained by choosing “power-sensor” under the environmental state “POWER” and to minimize the point loss by choosing “enemy-sensor” when confronted with the environmental state “ENEMY”. The gains and losses corresponding to the behavior-choice were shown to the subjects in the form of a pay-off matrix. Experiment I was conducted to examine the effect of the predictability of the environmental states on the subjects' performance, and Experiment II was conducted to examine the effect of the pay-off matrix on the subjects' performance. Both experiments indicated that subjects used the transitional probabilities of the environmental states as an important cue. In addition, the efficiency of the behavior-choice increased significantly in the case of low predictability of the environmental states under a risky environment. © 1985, The Japanese Psychological Association.

Whereas all children provided choice and no-choice scripts for poverty and wealth, only those who used choice scripts for wealth and few no-choice scripts for poverty derogated the poor. Derogation was found to be a developmental phenomenon, and the number of causal scripts for wealth attainment or loss also increased with age.

Among the persistent ( 6 loss preventing) strategies there is a largest one, but even if the game is won for some of the players, there is not always a largest winning strategy. However, there is a largest strategy such that one wins with certainty by playing it at random. The theorem on the value of a game with a preference function is proved in a minimax form. © 1985.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Interactions with physically disabled people often elicit both the desire to avoid the stigmatized and dependent person and feelings of responsibility to help the disadvantaged. This study examined the effort required to help, the helper's gender, and the help received by disabled and nondisabled confederates in searching for a lost object. One confederate was actually disabled and totally dependent on others for completing the helping task, but the other confederate was not disabled. Results indicated a significant interaction of effort and confederates' level of ability. Post hoc tests indicated no differences in helping disabled and nondisabled confederates in the low-effort condition, but, in the high-effort condition, the disabled confederate received significantly more help. These findings suggest that when costs of helping were low, decisions about helping each confederate did not appear to differ; but when costs were high, feelings of social responsibility outweighed both the additional effort involved and tendencies for avoidance in decisions to help the disabled confederate. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This essay presents necessary and sufficient first-order conditions for the general design of allocation mechanisms that decentralize Pareto optimal decisions in Arrow-Hahn-McKenzie (AHM) economies. An AHM economy is distinguished from the usual Arrow-Debreu private ownership economy since the consumption or production of any commodity may induce externalities, including initially endowed commodities. Because competitive markets will not generally internalize all externalities efficiently, the mechanism design must be generalized to include a rule that computes prices for commodities appearing as initial endowments so as to define consumers' individual budget sets. A natural design criterion for the generalized allocation mechanism is to have agents communicate both price and allocation messages to the center, enlarging the message space relative to that necessary for implementing mechanisms in Arrow-Debreu economies. The larger message spaces give agents increased flexibility, which has two significant consequences: (1) the dominant-strategy property of the Demand-Revealing Mechanism in economies with only public goods, a single pure private good, and quasilinear preferences, is lost unless the center adopts an enforcement structure that suitably restricts the allocation messages that agents may transmit; (2) if an endowed commodity is not a pure private good, then the Demand-Revealing Mechanism loses the dominant-strategy property, regardless of the enforcement structure adopted or of the nature of consumers' preferences, so that the problem is exacerbated in general AHM economies. © 1985 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Interviews were conducted with 58 physicians to ascertain what factors influenced their reporting of child abuse. When physicians were presented with sample cases of injured children, factors that influenced their decision to report suspected abuse included their attitudes toward physical discipline, seriousness of the injury, presence of other injuries, their familiarity with the family, appropriate parental concern, compatibility of the history and physical examination findings, and the child's behavior. Results indicated that inappropriate discipline was usually not equated with reportable child abuse. Physicians believed that abuse is not often reported because of its low incidence in the private practice setting, the fear of losing patients, the need for certainty, and the lack of confidence in community agencies. These beliefs may conflict with the welfare of young patients. © 1985, American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper investigates corporate headquarters relocation in the United States for the period 1957-1980. Corporate relocations are one explanatory element in the overall spatial process of headquarters evolution within post industrial urban systems. All major corporate relocations, mergers, bankruptcies, and new incorporations that effectively transfer corporate decision making to or from any metropolitan area are recorded for the five major sectors of the economy. A series of cartograms and bargraphs provide a summary of corporate headquarters relocations for the resource, manufacturing, and service, as well as utility and financial sectors of the economy. The cartographs indicate the magnitude and direction of all headquarters relocations as well as the location of major bankruptcies and new incorporations. The bargraphs indicate the relative gains and losses through move and merger activity for all members of the urban system. The findings indicate that, in contrast to other Western economies, the dominant national center, New York, is in absolute decline as a home for corporate headquarters. This decline and decentralization is seen as a response to the general maturation of the American urban system and emergence of an entire system of urban centers rapidly acquiring large corporate headquarters status. The decentralization process is evident in all sectors of the economy except finance. © 1985 by V. H. Winston & Son, Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Variation in decision making and allocation procedures has been shown to affect judgments of the fairness of the procedure and its outcome, but such effects have always been studied in the context of properly enacted procedures. It was hypothesized that the appearance of impropriety in the enctment of a fair procedure would increase the extent to which the procedure is judged in terms of its outcome. One hundred twenty undergraduate males and females were placed in the role of either defendant or observer with respect to an adversary procedure trial. Appearance of impropriety was manipulated during the trial by either including or not including evidence of a friendly personal relationship between the judge and the plaintiff's lawyer. The defendant was said to have either won or lost the case. A significant impropriety × outcome interaction on ratings of procedural fairness, unqualified by higher order effect, supported the hypothesis: a favorable outcome increased and an unfavorable outcome decreased the fairness of the procedure more when the impropriety was present. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for future investigation and theory on procedural justice and for practical issues. © 1985.\u001b[0m :\n",

In Study 1, 255 men and women (aged 24-91 yrs) completed a questionnaire concerning their coping responses to a recent life event categorized by the investigator as either a loss, a threat, or a challenge. In the 2nd study, 151 Ss (aged 21-90 yrs) completed a shortened version of the questionnaire in response to 3 separate stressors that they selected as a loss, a threat, and a challenge. Analysis of the use of 28 coping mechanisms showed that, across both studies, type of stressor had a consistent and significant effect on the choice of coping mechanisms. Faith, fatalism, and expression of feelings were used especially when Ss had experienced a loss; wishful thinking, faith, and fatalism were used by Ss facing a threat. A number of mechanisms were used more under conditions of challenge, including rational action, perseverance, positive thinking, intellectual denial, restraint, self-adaptation, drawing strength from adversity, and humor.

      "Abstract: Compared the predictive validities of 3 models of attitudes and behavioral decisions: M. Rosenberg's (1956) instrumentality-value model, M. Fishbein's (see PA, Vol 38:5939; 1967; Fishbein and I. Ajzen, 1965) belief-evaluation model, and L. R. Beach and colleagues' (see PA, Vols 56:9766 and 51:12072) adaptation of subjective expected utility theory. 70 female undergraduates rated each of the models' components and reported their attitudes and behavioral plans toward using 3 methods of contraception. With the traditional across-Ss prediction procedure, the Rosenberg model generally accounted for 5-25% less variance in Ss' attitudes and behavioral plans than the Fishbein and Beach models, which were not different. With a within-S prediction procedure, the Rosenberg model was again the least accurate, and the Fishbein and Beach models had similar predictive accuracy. As hypothesized, within-S predictions were more accurate than across-Ss predictions. The relatively poor performance of the Rosenberg model was attributable to the instrumentality component. It was also found that the Beach model could be simplified with no appreciable loss in predictive accuracy. An S's personal normative beliefs emerged as a strong independent predictor of behavioral plan.

      "Abstract: Difficulties exist in making treatment decisions for the very old and dependent patient. In the years to come, these difficulties will increase. It is argued that such persons should not be abandoned to their “rights” as autonomous persons; yet quality of life judgments should also be avoided except in limited circumstances. Since aging is a process of becoming more dependent, the author proposes a dependency rule, by which greater responsibility for treatment decisions falls on care‐givers as a person's dependency increases. In place of quality of life judgments he suggests a medical indications policy, if the latter includes restoration of some affective function. Five kinds of freedom are proposed, of which only some are lost in chronic illness and old age. Finally, it is suggested that life itself involves greater interdependence than the autonomy criterion itself can allow. The author focuses on the problem of dependency in the aged and the role an increase in this dependency plays, with corresponding loss of personal autonomy, in quality of life judgments. These, in turn, form the basis for treatment decisions. 1984 The American Geriatrics Society\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent research by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) has demonstrated that individual decisions are systematically affected by the way in which problems are presented. Specifically, individuals tend to be risk averse to problems framed in the positive direction (i.e., concerning gains) and to be risk seeking toward problems framed in the negative direction (i.e., concerning losses). This paper demonstrates that this concept of framing has wide explanatory power concerning a variety of concepts in organizational behavior and argues that the framing of experimental materials affects the formation of paradigms in organizational behavior. It is argued that many accepted findings may exist more because of the way researchers frame the problem than because of the presumed impact of the construct on individual behavior. Specific application is provided in the areas of (a) the escalation of commitment, (b) negotiator behavior, and (c) “the risky shift.” © 1984, Southern Management Association.

      "Abstract: An attempt is made to identify and document the problems of comparative evaluation of the more recent studies of psychiatric morbidity after abortion and to determine the current consensus so that when the results of the joint RCGP/RCOG study of the sequelae of induced abortion become available they can be viewed in a more informed context. The legalization of abortion has provided more opportunities for studies of subsequent morbidity. New laws have contributed to the changing attitudes of society, and the increasing acceptability of the operation has probably influenced the occurrence of psychiatric sequelae. The complexity of measuring psychiatric sequelae is evident from the many terms used to describe symptomatology and behavioral patterns and from the number of assessment techniques involved. Numerous techniques have been used to quantify psychiatric sequelae. Several authors conclude that few psychiatric problems follow an induced abortion, but many studies were deficient in methodology, material, or length of follow-up. A British study in 1975 reported a favorable outcome for a \"representative sample\" of 50 National Health Service patients: 68% of these patients had an absence of or only mild feelings of guilt, loss, or self reproach and considered abortion as the best solution to their problem. The 32% who had an adverse outcome reported moderate to severe feelings of guilt, regret, loss, and self reproach, and there was evidence of mental illness. In most of these cases the adverse outcome was related to the patient's environment since the abortion. A follow-up study of 126 women, which compared the overall reaction to therapeutic abortion between women with a history of previous mild psychiatric illness and those without reported that a significantly different emotional reaction could not be demonstrated between the 2 groups. In a survey among women seeking an abortion 271 who were referred for a psychiatric opinion regarding terminations of pregnancy were compared with 82 patients referred directly to a gynecological department. Termination caused little psychiatric disturbance provided the patient wanted an abortion. Cases of severe psychiatric outcome in the form of psychosis, severe depression, and schizophrenia have been reported. The outcome for women who were refused an abortion and the effects on the children born as a result have been discussed in several studies. In 1 survey, 24% of 249 women who were refused abortion were significantly disturbed after 18 months. Many studies comment on the value of counseling in the abortion decision, but few comparison studies have actually evaluated abortion counseling. A large amount of previously reported research on the psychiatric indications of abortion may be unreliable because women seeking abortions on mainly social grounds used to have to show psychiatric disturbance in order to obtain a legal abortion.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The proposition that the public will be likely to accept a reduction in the use of imprisonment as a penalty for property offenders if these offenders are required to make restitution was tested through the use of simultaneously conducted surveys of two random samples of 1200 persons each drawn from the New Zealand electoral rolls. Both the control and experimental (restitution) groups were presented with six crime incidents describing serious property crimes, were asked to indicate if imprisonment or some other penalty was selected, were permitted to indicate one or more penalties from descriptive statements representing fine, probation, community service sentence, and non-residential periodic detention; the restitution group was permitted to include restitution as a non-custodial penalty. Response rates of 76% for the control group and 80% for the restitution group were achieved from postal questionnaires. For all six crime incidents higher proportions of the control than restitution group recommended imprisonment; the null hypothesis was rejected at the. 05 level for five of the six incidents (alpha =.094 for the null hypothesis not rejected). Differences between the restitution and control groups are found across most age groups, for both sexes, for New Zealand electors of European descent, and for electors who reported that they had not been victimized in the last year. Over 65% of the restitution group members recommending non-custodial penalties selected restitution for each offender although they were less likely to select restitution for the unemployed as compared to the employed offender. This study provides support for the view that the public will accept a reduction in the use of imprisonment for serious property offenders if there is a concomitant increase in requiring these offenders to restore their victim losses. There has been substantial growth in programmes designed to impose and enforce an explicit restitution requirement on offenders since the establishment of the Minnesota Restitution Centre in 1972.1 The idea that an offender should be required to repay his or her victim as a part of the penalty for offending has been piloted in a number of restitution projects in both the American juvenile and adult systems.2 Considerable interest in the concept has been generated in Canada3, Britain4, Australia5 and New Zealand6. While the concept of requiring offenders to redress the damage done has an inherent appeal to justice and fairness, the concept has also received wide support from persons seeking alternatives to the use of imprisonment as a penalty for crime7. McDonald, after a detailed study of the cost of corrections in New York state, recommended restitution as one of several less costly alternatives to be used instead of imprisonment.8 The New Zealand Penal Policy Review Committee suggested “… public opinion is more likely to accept a reduction in the use of imprisonment if a corresponding move towards more effective redress for the victim can be seen”9. The research to date indicates considerable support for the concept of restitution. Gandy found ld… overwhelming support for the concept of creative restitution ….” among members of a women's club in Colorado.10 Gandy and Galaway found that restitution was perceived as a viable sanction for burglary, embezzlement, destruction of property and shoplifting among citizens of Columbia, South Carolina.11 Cannady reports 80% of a sample of citizens in Charleston, South Carolina, favourable to restitution as a sentence for juvenile offenders.12 Surveys of criminal justice officials in the United States13 and New Zealand14 indicate support for restitution. Hudson, Chesney, and McLaglan found over 80% of samples of United States state corrections administrators and of state legislators favoured the use of restitution with either juvenile or adult offenders.15 Surveys of both offenders and crime victims have found these groups also supportive of restitution. Novack, Galaway and Hudson's survey of offenders and victims who had participated in several American restitution projects found that 61% of the offenders and 60% of the victims considered restitution requirements fair.16 Sloper found 71% of New Zealand prison inmates surveyed agreed with a statement of where there is a victim, the offender should have to make good any damage done.17 Vennard found support for restitution among crime victims in Britain,18 Hinrichs among victims of juvenile offenders in Pennsylvania19 and Chesney among crime victims in Minnesota.20 Both Vennard and Hinricks conclude that restitution will lead to greater victim satisfaction with the justice system. Henderson and Gitchoff in a qualitative study of crime victims found that, “as to property victims, most victims appear willing to have the property restored, rather than wreak vengeance on the offender”.21 Gandy's study indicated support for restitution as an alternative to prison for property offenders22 and Shaw's survey of the British population explicitly addressed this issue.23 Persons interviewed were given 10 proposed measures for reducing the prison population and for each measure were asked “Can you tell me whether you personally think it is a good or bad idea?” Sixty-six per cent of the respondents reported that restitution was a good idea for reducing the prison population; the only choice to secure a higher proportion of support was requiring offenders to perform community service instead of going to prison. While restitution can be defended and may be acceptable independent of any presumed impact on prison populations, further advantages will accrue if an increase in restitution will result in public acceptance of a reduced use of imprisonment. This is most likely to occur in relation to property offenders who are perceived as less serious than persons who have committed acts of violence and for whom setting restitution amounts will be easier. This research was designed as a preliminary test of the proposition advanced by the Penal Policy Review Committee in regards to property offenders only. The hypothesis to be tested is that New Zealand electors who have the opportunity to recommend restitution either alone or in combination with other non-custodial penalties will be less likely to recommend imprisonment for property offenders than electors who do not have the option of including restitution as a non-custodial penalty. © 1984, The Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology and Authors.

      "Abstract: A betting model of empirical research is described. The model requires that opposing parties reach agreement on an operationalization and specify their predictions in terms of a probability distribution over possible research outcomes. Proper decision rules are used to decide on the amounts of reputation that are gained and lost upon observing the data. It is argued that adoption of the model would lead to less trivial research, less selective publication, and a more liberal attitude towards experimental design. The betting model is contrasted with several other methodologies. In these comparisons, methodological models are viewed as policies, i.e., sets of rules which lead to a certain predictable consequences if rational individuals exploit these rules to their own advantage. All comparisons reveal that the other models have relatively undesirable properties from this point of view. In discussing criticisms of the betting model, it appears that the model is also not completely water-proof from a policy point of view when participants do not wish to maximize their subjectively expected reputation. Other criticisms are discussed and are found wanting. © 1984.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Parasitic diseases are primarily diseases of poverty. At serious risk are individuals, communities and countries least able to afford the costs of treatment of prevention. In turn, economic development projects which aim to increase income levels may lead to negative results because of increased transmission of parasitic diseases often results. In attempting to analyse the economic consequences of parasitic diseases and the economics of their control, economists have usually relied on the tools of cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and financial analysis. These efforts are briefly reviewed in the paper. The results have been subject to considerable criticism because of conceptual and methodological problems. For example, most studies have not taken into account the epidemiology and natural history of the disease in estimating the associated economic losses, thereby leading to inappropriate conclusions. The UNDP/World Bank/WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases through its Social and Economic Research Scientific Working Group (SER-SWG) is promoting research on the economics of parasitic diseases. In an attempt to improve the usefulness and reliability of such studies, conceptual and methodological approaches have been suggested which are reported on here. To improve the research design of these projects, a conceptual framework is proposed which consists of four components: (1) baseline social, cultural and economic conditions influencing disease transmission; (2) resources already invested in the health system and investments in other related sectors such as agriculture, housing, water supply and sanitation; (3) health consequences resulting from (1) and (2); and (4) social and economic consequences resulting from (3). A key concern in relation to the framework is to determine the most useful basis for linking results from studies of one component to another so as to analyse more systematically the impacts of disease on individuals and society. Such studies are inherently interdisciplinary and close collaboration of economists with medical scientists and disease control programme staff is needed to ensure completeness and reliability of input data and results. Results from these studies could be used to inform national decision-makers about the social and economic consequences of the parasitic diseases and their control and, thus, should strengthen support for increased investment to reduce the parasitic disease burden in developing countries. © 1994.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Because individuals in the marketplace directly face opportunity costs, they must balance marginal costs against marginal benefits. In contrast, in politics, the opportunity costs facing decision makers are diluted. Estimates of the social costs of various public programs are generally understated, while the estimates of social benefits are exaggerated This paper places the establishment and expansion of the Redwood National Park within this framework and analyzes it as a public investment decision. It is shown that in the initial creation of the Redwood National Park in 1968, the costs of land acquisition and employment loss were underestimated, while the projections for gains in tourism were excessive. Despite the opposition of local landowners and residents, the Park was further expanded 10 years later in 1978. There was again a misstatement of costs and benefits and also the creation of an expensive new entitlement program to defuse the opposition of labor The experience with the redwood National Park illustrates the results of the political process, which allows decision makers to internalize benefits and externalize costs.

      "Abstract: Type A's have been described as more time urgent than Type B's, and research indicates that they underestimate the passage of fixed time intervals. The present study examined the implications of these differences in time perception for decisions where time is a resource that can be invested. Type A's and B's were given an initial stake of $4 and provided the opportunity to invest some or all of that amount for the chance to win an additional $2. Investment occurred as a function of time, with subjects believing they would win the additional $2 if a counter reached a randomly determined number. Each unit increment on the counter also resulted in the loss of 1¢ from the initial stake, thus as the counter progressed, goal attainment became more certain, but expenses also increased. Subjects could stop the counter at any time and keep the remainder of their initial stake or continue to invest until the initial stake was depleted (the counter was programmed to never hit the \"jackpot\"). Half of the subjects could monitor the counter directly, while the other half could not and had to rely on their subjective time estimates. Results indicated that when objective time passage cues were present, Type A's and B's did not differ in their investment decisions. When subjects had to estimate time passage, however, Type A's invested far more than Type B's. These results indicate that under appropriate conditions, Type A's are more susceptible than Type B's to psychological entrapment. © 1984.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper an attempt is made to introduce an asymmetric loss function in the context of a dynamic decision problem, where the target variables and instruments are related linearly, and where uncertainty is introduced by means of additive disturbances. Because of the particular form of the loss function an optimal linear feedback rule and an analytical expression for the minimal expected loss can only be formulated in the case of as many instruments as target variables.

Numerical experiments with a small artificial model, in which this open-loop policy is compared with the closed-loop policies resulting from two quadratic approximations are presented.

      "Abstract: Subjects playing the roles of either innocent or guilty defendants decided whether or not to accept a plea bargain based upon three sources of information. The likelihood of conviction, the sentence if a plea bargain were accepted, and the sentence if a plea bargain were rejected were manipulated in a factorial design. The results from two data analyses (percentage of subjects accepting and a continuous firmness of decision scale) lend support to the use of an optimizing decision strategy. A main effect of each independent variable was found for both the percentage and scale data. In addition, the results indicate that “innocent” individuals may be inclined to accept a plea bargain if the conditions are right in order to cut their losses. © 1984, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

      "Abstract: Differences in operationalizing definitions of disability, variations in methods of data collection and diversities in salient characteristics of disabled persons are generic problems in conducting social research surveys with persons who have disabilities. These problems are of concern not only to social scientists seeking to improve survey methods, but they also have practical significance to decision makers needing high quality information to guide social policies that influence the provision of health care, education and social services to persons with chronic impairments. Reports of 41 surveys on deaf adults in the United States and Canada conducted between 1959 and 1981 were analyzed to determine how rates of response, a key indicator of reliability of survey data, are affected by three methods of data collection, degree of verification efforts, scope of the sample and socio-demographic characteristics of those in the survey populations. Measurable results are provided so that planners of future surveys can correct for anticipated rates of sample attrition under various survey conditions. Other data indicate that trade-offs can be made between changes in the size of the sample and method of data collection to lead to more effective surveys. Important terms such as deafness, deaf population and deaf community are discussed as these relate to interpreting the results of survey studies on deaf adults. Discussion is also given to conducting social surveys with groups of individuals having other disabilities besides loss of hearing. © 1984.\u001b[0m :\n",

The questions of how managers edit multiatribute prospects and how editing relates to various independence assumptions were explored. The major result is that managers appear to violate attribute independence in its general form, and especially in the form of the marginality assumption. The most common form of behavior observed was multiattibute risk aversion for prospects involving only gains and multiattribute risk seeking for proposects involving only losses.\u001b[0m :\n",

Cost‐benefit analysis of seat belt usage was conducted to test this hypothesis. The results indicated that drivers of all size classes would gain from using seat belts in the case of low user costs while the drivers of subcompacts and compacts would gain in the case of higher user costs. However, less than one‐fifth of drivers wear seat belts. These results raise questions concerning the effectiveness of the informed buyer approach in areas of risk or uncertainty.

Obese women were interviewed using field methods. The grounded theory approach was utilized to analyze the data. Loss and isolation were predominant themes and stages through which women progressed before entering treatment. The entering of treatment was viewed as a way of adapting to sex role norms, or what was expected of women by society. Body image concerns‐the loss of attractiveness—was an overriding theme. Physical health played a minor role in this decision to seek treatment for obesity.

      "Abstract: It is hypothesized that children who have siblings terminated by abortion have similar psychological conflicts to those children who survive disasters or siblings who die of accident or illness. There is evidence that children are aware of their mother's pregnancy termination. Having been chosen to survive these children may have considerable conflicts regarding their existence. Since their life depended upon being wanted and they may become obsessively determined to please or they may feel a deep sense of obligation to their parents. If children have already lost a parent the child may look upon his new unborn sibling as a potential attachment. To be deprived by his mother's choice may stir latent hostility within the child the expression of which would be inhibited by the child's determination to stay wanted. Abortion survivors may be over protected by parents attempting to deal with their unresolved guilt. As a substitute child the abortion survivor may have placed upon him impossible expectations. It is contended that since approximately 50 percent of Western children are abortion survivors there is need to analyze their individual and collective responses. © 1983 Human Sciences Press.\u001b[0m :\n",

Environmental disputes involve complex scientific issues which the court system is not set up to comprehend, so that the process gives the parties to a dispute the sense of having lost control of their own destinies. An increasing number of parties to environmental disputes are turning to negotiation, or mediation, as an alternative in which they can be active parties in the settlement-making process rather than the victims of a court-imposed solution When do the parties to a dispute choose a negotiated settlement over a court battle? To what extent does each party make the concessions necessary to reach an agreement? These questions can be answered by the game theory that provides a model for analyzing the negotiation process.

      "Abstract: In a study of the results of each therapeutic act in the treatment of program of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus, 108 consecutive children were analyzed. An initial attempt at closed reduction was noted in 101 cases, with the attempt successful in 61. Of these elbows, 19 were flexed at least 120° following reduction, with all 19 maintaining reduction. Twenty-two of the remaining reduced fractures were splinted in less than 120° of flexion; 19 lost reduction. Traction alone, via olecranon pin or skin, was unsuccessful in achieving reduction and unreliable in maintaining reduction once achieved. Cross Kirschner wires, placed percutaneously or under direct visualization, were uniformly successful in maintaining reduction. From these data an algorithm has been constructed to facilitate objective decision-making in the treatment of this challenging fracture.\u001b[0m :\n",

Further, equity theory does not address the issue of whether negative outcomes (losses) are allocated differently from positive outcomes (gains). Drawing on attribution theory, we hypothesized that allocators 1) take effort more into account than ability, and 2) take between-member contribution differences more into account in gain than in loss conditions. Male and female Ss (N = 120) were asked to distribute financial gains or losses between the two members of a hypothetical performance team who contributed different or equal amounts of effort and ability to the team product.

      "Abstract: In conflict games, there exists no strict competition between the two subjects, because the profit to one subject causes no loss for the other. The payoff structure is designed in such a way that choices, based only on the own utility, result with certainty in low payoff decisions. If the other's payoff is also taken into consideration, this may result in uncertain outcomes. It is possible that reasonable payoffs for both subjects can be reached but a low payoff is also possible. In such conflicts, the principle of individual rationality no longer provides reasonable solutions. Psychological researches have mainly focused on the topics of conflict resolution, social motivation, and information processing in iterated games. Changes in predictions in the course of the gaming sequence show that players process information about the other player's gaming behavior. There is a minor group of players whose predictions become increasingly more accurate in the course of gaming. These subjects are called “realists. © 1983, Elsevier Science & Technology.

      "Abstract: As research on bargaining and allocation behavior emphasizes the positive nature of joint outcomes, the question is raised about the extent to which decisions for allocation procedures differ when joint outcomes are negative instead of positive. Although prominent theories of allocation behavior do not differentiate between allocation strategies in the case of jointly produced gains and losses, it is reasoned that losses may stimulate preferences for a formal allocation strategy (i.e., through judicial court) as compared to preferences for an informal allocation strategy (negotiating for the allocation device) in the case of gains. Results of a questionnaire study in which 321 Ss were led to make decisions in a Prisoner's Dilemma-like payoff situation supported this hypothesis. Ss more frequently preferred an allocation clarified by court when losses occurred as a consequence of joint activities than, when gains occurred. The implications of this finding are discussed with regard to perceptions of the payoff situation and the social context within which the procedural decisions were supposed to be made. © 1983 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

Previous research on this subject suggests that defendants' case-related losses are due entirely to legal expenses and the disruption of productive activity. In this paper it is shown that two out of five portfolios of defendant firms earn abnormal losses when final decisions in antimerger cases are announced. These losses are consistent with the imposition of costly constraints on some defendants by government antitrust enforcers. The tests also show that when acquisitions are canceled following antimerger complaints, the losses to the target firms are substantial and completely offset the gains generated when the acquisitions are proposed. © 1983.\u001b[0m :\n",

The two strategies were compared by calculating cumulative numbers of person-years lost for hypothetical cohorts of men and women. Prophylactic cholecystectomy slightly decreases survival. A 30-year-old man choosing prophylactic cholecystectomy instead of expectant management would lose, on average, 4 days of life; a 50-year-old man would lose 18 days. Consideration of monetary costs and discounting further disfavors prophylactic cholecystectomy.

Committee member Howard Orr, Centers for Disease Control, noting the emphasis on cautionary and warning statements contained in current OC labeling maintained: \"Women should make informed decisions and this is the other half. The package insert must include the benefits information.\" The recommendation by the committee represents a shift in the approach to what constitutes proper labeling for OC products. Since first approved, the drugs have never carried a discussion of benefits on their labels. \"A number of additional benefits from OCs--other than contraception--have emerged from the large number of studies recorded in the literature on OC use,\" Ron Nelson, White Memorial Medical Center, stated. \"Studies cited a more regular and lighter menstrual flow, resulting in less blood loss and lower iron deficiency and anemia in contraceptive pill users, and dysmenorrhea and premenstrual tension have been sifnificantly reduced.\" \"Ovarian cysts and pelvic inflammatory disease occurred less frequently in pill users than in controls,\" Nelson continued, \"and the incidence of fibrocystic disease of the breast were less. There are some instances where OCs may incur protection against the development of ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis.\" Orr added: \"I think there are 2 good studies that show almost a total elimination of ectopic pregnancy with women who took the pill. Given that now there's an epidemic of the disease going around, I think it's worth adding.\" The committee was asked by FDA last November to recommend changes in the current physician and patient OC labeling.

These biases are best dealt with by bringing them out into the open at all stages of the research, so that their effects can be recognised and allowed for. Finally, some suggestions have been made for the interviewing of very old people. They include the reminder that such respondents are highly individual, and cannot be adequately described by stereotypes; but consideration should be shown for common disabilities such as hearing loss. Respondents should be allowed to set their own pace, however slow that may seem to the interviewer, and as far as possible, their own choice of emphasis on topics. And like respondents of all ages, they must be interviewed only with their full consent and understanding, and accorded the respect due to one human being by another.

      "Abstract: Entrapping conflicts are those in which decision makers continue investing their resources in a costly or losing course of action in order to justify the appropriateness of already sunken costs. Given the great costs often associated with becoming entrapped, it would seem worthwhile to learn how this decision‐making process can be avoided or reduced. The present experiments addressed this issue. In Experiment 1 subjects participated in an entrapping waiting situation in which self‐focused attention should have been phenomenologically uncomfortable. To test the notion that self‐directed attention would cause reduced entrapment, half of the participants waited in the presence of a mirror whereas half did not. As predicted, subjects became significantly less entrapped in the former than in the latter condition. Experiment 2 studied whether subjects would be less likely to enter a conflict that could later prove entrapping if they were made aware beforehand of the process of entrapment. Half of the individuals in this field experiment were given a brief general description of the process of entrapment, whereas half were not. As expected, subjects were significantly less likely to enter the situation if they had been provided the information about entrapment. The implications of these and other findings are discussed.

The hypothesis that the past is reconstructed to conform with current developmental stages was examined. Results indicate that when developmental gains were made over a 1-yr interval, Ss used a higher stage perspective to reconstruct the decision making involved in resolving a problematic pregnancy and, hence, reconstructed the events in different terms than were originally presented. When developmental gains were not made over a 1-yr interval, Ss reconstructed the events in the same terms as originally presented. Further analysis indicated that those Ss who made developmental gains also referred to a phenomenon of \"memory loss.\" Results support the hypothesis that memory is reconstructive rather than reproductive.

      "Abstract: Cost/benefit analysis is often an imprecise tool because of assumptions that must be made about matters that are difficult to quantify. The problems become especially acute when lives or serious bodily injuries are at stake because of the serious nature of that which is being risked. Furthermore, the literature on cost/benefit analysis focuses on public decision‐making situations and decisions by individuals. This paper examines the distinctiveness of the use of cost/benefit analysis involving putting dollar values on human life by for‐profit firms. The argument developed in the paper is that the lack of participation by the affected party (or government representative) in balancing costs and benefits raises special ethical concerns. A formula that was developed by the Ford Motor Company concerning accidents involving fuel leakage and fire with resultant loss of life and serious burn injuries is used as an example of both the imprecision of the method and the distinctive factors of the decision process that raise special ethical considerations. The paper examines why the for‐profit‐decision is distinct, what the special ethical considerations are, and concludes with a discussion of several alternative procedures to monitor the use of cost/benefit analysis so that it would be an effective business tool while at the same time the individual is provided maximum protection.

      "Abstract: This paper presents an heuristic framework for analyzing hazards (potential for loss or harm) and strategies that may be developed to control their realization. Two basic forms of intervention for hazard control (anticipation and reaction) are identified. Three broad anticipative strategies are discussed: (1) elimination of the source of the hazard, (2) containment of the risk of its realization, and (3) mitigation of likely consequences. The communication and judgmental processes involved in decisions about strategies are shown to be embedded in the organizational \"political\" context, in which a variety of interests backed by varying sources of power and influence are represented. The development, implementation, and monitoring of any strategies that are decided upon are then discussed, including the fact that such actions and events may not produce the intended results. Comments are also made on the need for data provided by monitoring to be evaluated and appropriate adaptations made. Finally, a brief section of the paper discusses reactive strategies. © 1983.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many day-to-day decisions involving risk are based on a person's memory for the past sequence of outcomes. The study of sequential decision making investigates how individuals use information about the past sequence of outcomes in order to make risky decisions. In this article, a random walk decision model called the confidence strength model is evaluated which was designed to describe the cognitive processes individuals use to combine sequential information provided by event patterns with payoff information in a sequential decision-making task. Two related experiments are reported which were designed to test various assumptions of the confidence strength model. The particular task used to study sequential decision making was the differential payoff paradigm in which the decision maker was required to predict which of two uncertain events would occur on each trial. Following each choice, feedback was presented in the form of differential monetary payoffs which were contingent on the alternative-event combination occurring on that trial. Payoffs were manipulated by varying the loss for incorrect decisions associated with each alternative, and sequential information was manipulated by constructing event sequences with a fixed distribution of run lengths within each block of trials. The response measures included the proportion of trials one alternative was chosen over another and also the average choice speed for each alternative. The main theoretical result was that the confidence strength model provided a good overall fit to the pattern of results for the choice proportion measure, and also accounted for a majority fo the findings obtained from the choice speed measures, although there were some minor exceptions. The confidence strength model provided a better account of the present results and previous research than several alternative choice models that were considered. © 1982.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article summarizes the results of a study of 291 reported cases brought against media for libel during a four‐year period. The results confirmed the finding in an earlier study that only 5 percent of plaintiffs emerged from the appellate process with judgments compared with more than 60 percent of defendants. Most of the defense successes occurred without trial. In cases that did reach trial, plaintiffs were successful far more often before juries than before judges but lost more than half these judgments on appeal. Cases were analyzed in terms of the identity of the parties, the content of the charges, and the role of state and federal law in shaping the outcome. Despite the recent attention to federal constitutional protections, it is clear that media defendants still do, and must, rely heavily on state law defenses. Finally, the Hutchinson and Wolston rulings of 1979 produced little change in appellate decisions. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The macro literature presents conflicting evidence on the effects of price controls. In this study, the fact that the macro-economic effect of wage and price controls is the aggregation of the micro-economic effects is used to implement a different approach to measure the effects of price controls. The effect of price controls is inferred from examining the impact of discretionary regulatory decisions on the equity values of individual firms during Phase II of Nixon's Economic Stabilization Program. The empirical results indicate that violators of the regulations incurred significant abnormal losses that were unrelated to the explicit penalties. This suggests that implicit penalties were imposed on offending firms. The analysis of price increase decisions provides weak evidence that these Price Commission decisions had an impact on equity values. © 1982.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Entrapping conflicts are those in which individuals continue to invest their resources-even in seemingly losing propositions-in large part to justify previous unfilled expenditures. It has been demonstrated that individuals define their motivation for investing very differently at the various stages of an entrapping conflict. One implication of this motivational dynamic is that various factors may differentially affect degree of entrapment (i.e., amount invested), depending upon the point in time at which they are introduced. The present studies were designed to test this notion. All subjects were given an initial monetary stake and had the opportunity to win more by taking part in an entrapping investment situation. In Experiment 1, half the subjects were provided with a payoff chart that made salient the costs associated with investing (Highcost salience condition) whereas half were not (Low-cost salience condition). Moreover, for half of the subjects the payoff chart was introduced before they were asked to invest (Early condition) whereas for the other half it was introduced after they had invested a considerable portion of their resources (Late condition). Entrapment was lower in the High salience-Early than in the Low salience-Early condition. However, there was no difference between groups in the Late condition. In Experiment 2, the perceived presence of an audience interacted with personality variables related to face-saving to effect entrapment. When the audience was described as \"experts in decision making,\" subjects high in public self-consciousness (or social anxiety) became less entrapped than those low on these dimensions. When the audience consisted of individuals who \"wished simply to observe the experimental procedure,\" however, high public self-consciousness (or social anxiety) individuals were significantly more entrapped than lows. Moreover, these interaction effects occurred when the audience was introduced late, but not early, into the entrapment situation. Taken together, these (and other) findings suggest that economic factors are more influential determinants of behavior in the earlier stages of an entrapping conflict, whereas face-saving variables are more potent in the later phases. Alternative explanations are discussed. © 1982.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: 'Years of life lost' is a quantity widely used in biostatistics to assess the importance of a cause of death. In its traditional meaning the phrase refers to the number of additional years that the average person in a specified reference group could expect to live if a given cause of death were eliminated. Recently the idea has been reformulated and applied to genetic conditions. The present paper begins with a description of the traditional calculation and goes on to present the reformulation, first for congenital diseases and then for diseases with delayed onset. A discussion follows of how different ages in a person's life should be weighted and the value considerations implicit in whatever decision one makes. The next topic is the way one eliminates a genetic disease, the concrete procedures used to do it, followed by morbidity due to genetic disease and the calculation of years of life lost due to nongenetic risk factors. The paper concludes with next steps in assessing the impact of genetic disease. © 1981 D. Reidel Publishing Co.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Detailed assessment of the potential of an alien species to become a pest when introduced into a new area requires a comprehensive knowledge of the biology of that species. In the absence of such knowledge, species can be classified for temperate areas into one of four categories of risk on the basis of capacity for survival in similar climates and presence of host plants outdoors or under glass. The categories are: 1) potential outdoor pests, 2) potential glasshouse pests, 3) species that have outdoor hosts but are unlikely to become pests on them unless they adapt genetically (no hosts under glass), and 4) species that have no host plants outdoors or under glass, or are incapable of prolonged survival outdoors. Some aspects of the more detailed assessment of better known species are suitable for computer simulation modelling. The features of a phenological model currently being developed in England are briefly described. Estimates of the benefits derived from excluding a particular alien pest can be obtained from the cost of the additional annual control measures likely to be required if the pest were to be introduced. Estimates of factors such as crop losses, environmental problems and increased research and advisory work must be added to obtain a range of costs for years when pest populations are likely to be ← high →, ← normal → and ← low →. Costs of excluding the pest must include cost to government (staff costs, eradication measures, publicity etc.) and costs to industry. The resulting comparison of benefit with cost can aid decisions on the design and enforcement of phytosanitary regulations. Copyright © 1981, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents an experimental investigation of comparisons in attitudes towards risk between risk managers and non‐risk managers. The two groups of managers responded to a number of hypothetical business decisions and their risk‐taking attitude in each decision was measured by expressing the degree to which their actual choice differed from the expected monetary value as a fraction of the absolute value of the expected monetary value. Fifty per cent of the decisions involved a prospect of profit or break even, while the remainder held out only the prospect of a loss or no loss. A significant difference was detected in the attitudes of managers in each group. There was a great similarity in attitude over all subjects in those decisions involving profit but in potential loss‐producing problems the risk managers were considerably more risk averse. Rather than resulting in a contempt for loss the risk managers' familiarity with loss‐producing events would seem to have led them to a far higher degree of caution. The adaptability of non‐risk managers to the loss situation together with the methods of management education are both called into question by these findings. 1981 The British Psychological Society\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Making trade-offs is an important property of rational choice behavior. Studies of the effects of income-leisure trade-offs on job search and on employment, and studies of employee's preferences among various fringe benefits and pay have implicitly made the assumption that people can make meaningful trade-off decisions. Unfortunately empirical studies of actual trade-off decisions are scarce. The present study employed a new technique which allowed the direct measurement of trade-offs between five aspects of managerial jobs: salary, authority, interest in job, influence on company's policy, and status. The theoretical framework borrows from theories of choice behavior (cf. H. A. Simon, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 1955, 69, 99-118; A. Tversky, Psychological Review, 1972, 79, 281-299) and hypothesized that trade-offs would not be made over the entire range of the attributes, and that they would be nonsymmetrical for \"gains\" and \"losses.\" Fifty-six senior executives of a large company made direct trade-off decisions between all pairs of the five aspects. The data were analyzed by means of minimizing a least squares loss function to estimate the trade-off coefficients. Indifference curves between each two attributes were drawn and revealed interesting patterns pertaining to the way people make trade-offs, which appears to be different than what is assumed under the model of rational choice behavior. © 1981.\u001b[0m :\n",

Control of the epidemic can be effected at any instant by varying the birth and death rates to represent quarantine and medical care programs. An optimal strategy is one which minimizes the expected discounted losses and costs resulting from the epidemic process and the control programs over an infinite horizon. We formulate the problem as a continuous-time Markov decision model. Then we present conditions ensuring that optimal quarantine and medical care program levels are nonincreasing functions of the number of infectives in the population. We also analyze the dependence of the optimal strategy on the model parameters. Finally, we present an application of the model to the control of a rumor.\u001b[0m :\n",

The gambles in each pair were equated for expected value but differed in variance, amounts to win and lose and their respective probabilities. Information about each dimension could be obtained by the subject sequentially according to his preference. The results show that subjects are less risky under High as compared to Medium and Low time pressure, risk taking being measured by choices of gambles with lower variance or lower amounts to lose and win. Subjects tended to spend more time observing the negative dimensions (amount to lose and probability of losing), whereas under low time pressure they preffered observing their positive counterparts. Information preference was found to be related to choices. Filtration of information and acceleration of its processing appear to be the strategies of coping with time pressure. © 1981.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The ability of decision makers to deal with information in terms of category labels rather than as precise data points is hypothesized as an explanation of how complex choices are made within the limits imposed by human information‐processing capacity. Twenty‐five decision makers placed bets under varying conditions of grouping of cues (probability of winning/losing, amount to be won, amount to be lost) as a test of this hypothesis. The results indicate that experimental pre‐grouping of cues has: (1) a statistically significant but practically unimportant impact on amounts bet; (2) no statistically significant effect on number of different bets made; and (3) no statistically significant effect on the fit of the bets to those predicted by an expected value model, except when grouping categories are very wide. These results support the contention that decision making occurs through the manipulation of category labels rather than exact values. Study of processes by which numerous exact cues are reduced to a smaller number of category labels is suggested as a complement to the study of sequential processing of alternatives, satisficing, the use of heuristics, and other means by which human beings make complex choices with limited cognitive capacity.

      "Abstract: Researchers have found a tendency for Ss in gambling situations to reverse their preferences for different types of gambles. That is, Ss tended to choose to play more conservative (low variance) gambles, but to set higher selling prices for riskier (high variance) gambles, despite the bets having equal expected values. The present research investigated this preference-reversal phenomenon in a simulated managerial decision task. In the task, 97 undergraduates had to choose which of 2 products to develop and market as well as set prices for the products. Ss were given estimates of the profits (or losses) that would accrue if the product were a success or a failure and the corresponding probabilities of success and failure. In addition, some Ss made the decisions as individuals, whereas others made the decisions in groups. Results reveal that Ss tended to reverse their preferences but not as frequently as found in the gambling task. Further, results reveal that groups were significantly more prone to the decision bias than individuals.

The present investigation attempts to answer the question of when, and which, inputs are taken into account in allocation decisions. Subjects were given a stimulus story in which two fictitious persons had, through joint work, produced a monetary gain or loss; further, information was provided on the relative effort (amount of time worked intensively) and /or ability (as determined by a test) that each stimulus person had contributed. Subjects were asked how they would allocate the gain or loss. Empirical evidence for the following three codeterminants of allocation decisions was obtained: (1) the type of input—personal and behavioural characteristics are [relevant] for allocation if they are perceived as (a) causallv important for outcome production, (b) variable, and (c) under the person's volitional control; (2) the type of outcome to be allocated—more equal allocations are observed when loss as opposed to gain must be allocated; and (3) the constellation of individual inputs on given dimensions—information is given on several input dimensions, a dimension which should be [irrelevant] according to criteria (a), (b), and (c) does codetermine allocations when recipients have contributed equally with respect to this dimension.

      "Abstract: This study illustrates a methodology as a first step toward the development of a benefit/cost model for the evaluation of the Federal Trade Commission regulation of the unavailability of advertised specials in food stores. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate economic losses to shoppers from unavailable advertised specials. Product unavailability in the model occurred as a result of alternative managerial decisions about purchase‐order quantities for advertised specials and shelf‐stocking policies combined with probabilistic purchase decisions by customers. The model generated probabilistic individual customer and management behavioral responses to unavailability during a one‐year time period. As a result, the derived economic losses to customers from unavailability were based on alternative assumptions about managerial behavior in conjunction with empirically derived shopper responses to advertised specials. This study thus provides some idea of the amount of damages being caused by the excessive unavailability of advertised specials. Aggregate customer losses were found to vary primarily with respect to management's purchase‐order quantity of advertised specials. Copyright © 1980, Wiley Blackwell.

The theoretical concept of decisional control (i.e., perceived choice) guided the investigation. Significant multivariate effects were found for all dimensions of morale: agitation, attitude toward own aging, lonely dissatisfaction, and a combined morale index. Choice within the institution and social interaction were the major contributors to these significant multivariate relationships, but income was also influential in analysis of the attitudinal and combined morale indices for a subsample. Retrospective measures of health at relocation and choice in relocation were unstable in their contributions to overall mutivariate relationships. Relationships of age, recency of loss of a significant other, and length of residency to morale were explored and found not to be significant.

Since significant reflection at either level does not necessarily imply significant reflection at the other, upper and lower bounds are computed for each. Four types of within-subject reflectivity are distinguished and analyzed. Relationships among these types are examined theoretically as well as empirically.

Findings suggest that the major stated motivations for leaving places of origin, especially among those from metropolitan areas, are \"quality of life\" considerations. About a fourth of the metropolitan origin migrants' and half of the non metropolitan origin migrants' reasons are job-related. Anti-urban push and pro-rural pull responses are prevalent among migrants from metropolitan areas. Subsequent analysis of reasons for leaving metropolitan residences suggests consistency with other objective variables. Among households with a working-age head, those leaving for \"quality of life\" reasons came disproportionately from the largest metropolitan centers and went to the smallest towns. Those moving for non-employment reasons are not more likely to have taken an initial income loss, though they are less likely to experience immediate income gains. © 1979 Population Association of America.\u001b[0m :\n",

Then, using actual forecasts over a 2-year period, we calculated the monetary losses incurred as a result of incorrect forecasts. The results generally show losses in the thousands of dollars for each erroneous forecast.- from Authors\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risk taking by 53 nurses and 22 non-nurses was investigated in nursing and nonnursing situations in a laboratory study to assess nurses’ propensity to risk and to gain information about how nurses make decisions. Games involving loss and gain of money were used. Subjects received money won from the games, but debts incurred by subjects were canceled. The study indicated that unwillingness to accept risk is not characteristic of all nurses. A nurse’s propensity to risk appeared to depend on the situation and on the nurse’s educational level. Study findings, though restricted by the mode of investigation, have implications for practice and future research. © Lippincott-Raven Publishers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In recent years, the federal government has pro vided substantial relief to victims of natural disasters. A pri mary reason for this assistance is that many of the individuals suffering damage have not protected themselves with insur ance. Standard coverage, normally required as a condition for a mortgage, offers protection against fire, wind, and hail damage; flood and earthquake policies can be purchased sep arately, and most residents of hazard-prone areas have not voluntarily bought this coverage. Recent empirical evidence on individuals' decision processes with respect to protection against events which have a relatively small chance of oc curring but can result in severe losses is summarized. Unless individuals have been made graphically aware of the conse quences of disasters, typically through past experience, they are unlikely to even consider purchasing insurance protec tion. Once their interest is stimulated they use informal net works such as friends and neighbors to guide them in their actions. Tradeoffs between using voluntary means of promot ing insurance or some other form of required coverage are discussed. Policy decisions have to reflect both the decision processes of individuals as well as value judgments on the appropriate role of the private and public sectors in natural disasters. © 1979, Sage Publications.

      "Abstract: Thirty empirically assessed utility functions on changes in wealth or return on investment were examined for general features and susceptability to fits by linear, power, and exponential functions. Separate fits were made to below‐target data and above‐target data. The usual “target” was the no‐change point. The majority of below‐target functions were risk seeking; the majority of above‐target functions were risk averse; and the most common composite shape was convex‐concave, or risk seeking in losses and risk averse in gains. The least common composite was concave‐concave. Below‐target utility was generally steeper than above‐target utility with a median below‐to‐above slope ratio of about 4.8. The power and exponential fits were substantially better than the linear fits. Power functions gave the best fits in the majority of convex below‐target and concave above‐target cases, and exponential functions gave the best fits in the majority of concave below‐target and convex above‐target cases. Several implications of these results for decision making under risk are mentioned. Copyright © 1979, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The study was conducted to assess initial expected adjustment and resulting economic losses to producers of grass seed from selected public policy choices for reducing open field burning. A quadratic programming algorithm was used to model a commercial grass seed farm on which poorly-drained soils predominate with limited acreage of medium and well-drained lands. The model was optimized and validated to represent a comparison of economic conditions under open field burning against selected alternative public policy choices. Quantitative comparisons showed considerable differences in expected or probable economic impacts to growers among the public policy choices.

Contributory factors are severe tissue loss, pain, appearance, infection, functional requirements, sexual reasons, psychological makeup of the patient, economics, safety, the time elapsed since injury, the patient's body image and his desires, and the surgeon's opinion. Fifteen patients elected hand amputation for various combinations of these factors. Eleven were fitted with a prosthesis at the time of operation and three within 3 weeks.

      "Abstract: Notes that there are 2 equivalent modes for presenting a simple 2-outcome gamble. In the final outcomes presentation, a player is offered a gamble (x, p, y, 1--ip) in which x might be won with probability p, and otherwise y might be lost with probability 1--ip. In the stake presentation (y, p, x + y) the player has to pay the stake, y, in advance if wanting to play the gamble. One might then win x + y with probability p and nothing otherwise. C. H. Coombs and G. Avrunin's (1971) theory of conflict and single-peaked preferences is interpreted in terms of such gambles. It is shown that the theory allows different predictions of Ss' choices for the 2 presentation modes. The theory predicts that for certain sets of stake gambles, Ss' preferences will be single-peaked functions of the stake. If, however, the gambles are transformed into the equivalent final outcome gambles, the theory does not predict single-peaked preferences. Thus, this mathematical theory of preference implies that formally irrelevant aspects of presentation greatly influence Ss' choices. This prediction was empirically supported in tests with 30 university students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1978 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

An alternative is offered to economists' cognitively unrealistic assumption that decision makers calculate probability distributions to assess the riskiness of uncertain outcomes. Fish sellers appear to minimize risks not by refusing to take risks above a minimum acceptable probability of loss, but by refusing to market their fish if any one of several discrete tests indicates unfavorable market conditions, a “multiple check” strategy derived from sellers' verbal reports. 1978 American Anthropological Association\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Quality of urban life is considered in terms of the range and value of opportunities which are realized in an urban area. Choice is considered as the means of this realization and its elements are the diverse range of human activity patterns preferred, the range of opportunities supplied to meet them, and the capacity of individuals to realize these opportunities. Thus, freedom of choice within the available resources is the mechanism assumed for matching these preferences and opportunities. A normal distribution of parameter values defining these opportunities is assumed and is approximated by a logistic distribution for simplicity of evaluation. The value or benefit of the opportunities realized is formulated, and is calibrated in terms of 'willingness to pay'. Net benefit is defined as the price people are prepared to pay less the actual costs incurred. The loss in benefit when choice is constrained in various ways is also evaluated. The benefit to the community of decentralization of urban decisions and community participation in them can be evaluated similarly. These net benefits and losses are expressed in terms of the urban decisions to be made. They may be aggregated to evaluate a particular urban plan, and hence to compare alternative plans. Alternatively, the plans may be viewed holistically and the relative (trade-off) values implied by choices between them may be used in an interactive process to seek the most beneficial plan. The diversity of opportunities available within the plan is among the parameters to be determined. The decision process is then a two-level one: At the community level, the optimal parameter set including its diversity is selected on an overall basis. At the individual level, supply and demand are matched by individual freedom of choice. Selections made at the individual level may be fed back to the community level to provide further guidance in the search for the plan providing maximum quality of urban life subject to the resources available. © 1978.\u001b[0m :\n",

In each list, risk was manipulated by variance or skewness but not both. All analyses were done separately for each S. Most Ss (67%) took more risk when they had fallen behind than when they were ahead. The amount of risk taken was also influenced by patterns of runs of wins and losses; the direction of the influence depended on the individual. The risk order between 2 gambles with zero expectation and the same variance but differing in skewness was not independent of the variance level, in contrast to the findings of an earlier study by C.

The answers to questions such as these are vital for understanding how people cope with threats from accidents, diseases, and natural hazards and for helping them manage their lives more effectively in the face of such risks. This paper illustrates the role that the psychological study of judgment and decision processes can play in providing answers to these questions.

      "Abstract: The economics of a forecasting scheme for predicting the need for chemical control of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, on spring‐sown field beans, Vicia faba, are compared with alternative control strategies, namely no treatment, eradicant treatment and routine preventive treatment. Two criteria are assessed. First, the ‘risk’ of lost revenue from wrong control decisions and, secondly, the overall profitability of the strategy. A wrong decision is made when a profitable treatment is not applied or when an unprofitable one is applied. These constitute ‘risk’ for the grower. The forecasting scheme involves least risk of monetary loss and the most acceptable alternative strategy is the routine preventive treatment. Relative to the routine treatment, a gain averaging £3.78/ha of bean crop would have been made between the years 1970‐5 by adopting control based on the forecasting scheme. There was considerable year‐by‐year and area‐to‐area variation in monetary benefits, with the largest gains in areas where economic damage occurred least frequently and where relatively large areas of beans are grown, as in East Anglia. Other benefits of using the forecasting scheme, e.g. correct timing of chemical application, are discussed but not evaluated. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Two experiments investigated effects of communication on behavior in an 8-person commons dilemma of group vs individual gain. A total of 593 persons recruited through newspaper ads served as either participants or observers. Ss made a single choice involving a substantial amount of money (possible outcomes ranging from nothing to $10.50). In Exp I, 4 communication conditions (no communication, irrelevant communication, relevant communication, and relevant communication plus roll call) were crossed with the possibility of losing money. Ss chose self-serving (defecting) or cooperating responses and predicted responses of other group members. Defection was significantly higher in the no-communication and irrelevant-communication conditions than in relevant-communication and relevant-communication plus roll call conditions. Loss had no effect on decisions. Defectors expected much more defection than did cooperators. Exp II replicated irrelevant communication and cooperation effects and compared predictions of participants with those of observers. Variance of participants' predictions was significantly greater than that of observers, indicating that participants' decisions were affecting their expectations about others' behavior.

Secondly, it is argued that optimal solutions deteriorate because of changes in both the systems that employ them and their environments. Therefore, OR and MS should engage in designing decision systems that learn and adapt well rather than in producing optimal solutions that do not, Thirdly, it is argued that the conventional concept of optimality does not take into account two important types of aesthetic values', stylistic preferences and those arising from a sense of progress. Finally, it is argued that individual scientists cannot be objective in the conventional sense, but the Science can be in an unconventional sense.

      "Abstract: Multiple criteria decision problems with one decision maker have been recognized and discussed in the recent literature in optimization theory, operations research and management science. The corresponding concept with n-decision makers, namely multicriteria n-person games, has not yet been extensively explored. In this paper we first demonstrate that existing solution concepts for single criterion n-person games in both normal form and characteristic function form induce domination structures (similar to those defined and studied by Yu [39] for multicriteria single decision maker problems) in various spaces, including the payoff space, the imputation space and the coalition space. This discussion provides an understanding of some underlying assumptions of the solution concepts and provides a basis for generalizing and generating new solution concepts not yet defined. Also we illustrate that domination structures may be regarded as a measure of power held by the players. We then illustrate that a multicriteria problem can naturally arise in decision situations involving (partial) conflict among n-persons. Using our discussion of solution concepts for single criterion games as a basis, various approaches for resolving both normal form and characteristic function form multicriteria n-person games are proposed. For multicriteria games in characteristic function form, we define a multicriteria core and show that there exists a single 'game point' whose core is equal to the multicriteria core. If we reduce a multicriteria game to a single criterion game, domination structures which are more general than 'classical' ones must be considered, otherwise some crucial information in the game may be lost. Finally, we discuss a parametrization process which, for a given multicriteria game, associates a single criterion game to each point in a parametric space. This parametrization provides a basis for the discussion of solution concepts in multicriteria n-person games. © 1977 D. Reidel Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

Sensation level data are presented that reflect marked differences between such individuals with regard to probability of response, and means and standard deviations of auditory reaction times. Means and standard deviations of auditory reaction times for nonfunctional subjects are greatly reduced when compared with results obtained by simulated or actual functional subjects. Probability of response data was less effective in differentiating functional from nonfunctional subjects.

      "Abstract: In the multistage betting game (MBG), a decision maker (DM) is provided with some capital x which he is required to bet over m (m > 1) mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive alternatives, each of which occurs with probability pi (pi > 0, i = 1,..., m; Σi = 1m pi = 1). If yi is bet on alternative i (yi ≥ 0, Σi = 1m yi = x) and alternative i obtains, the DM's capital for the next stage is yiri, (ri > 0). The MBG lasts until either the DM loses his capital or N stages elapse, whichever comes first. Each of six subjects participated in six sessions consisting of several hundred 3-alternative MBG stages. A within-subject design assigned negative expected value (EV) bets to the first three sessions and positive EV bets to three more sessions. Significant effects were found due to return rate, capital size, homogeneous runs of either wins or losses, and individual differences. Four maximization of expected utility and two minimization of risk models were presented and tested. A modified logarithmic utility model is proposed, which provides the best fit to the data.

Actual group decisions following discussion are compared with predictions of a majority-rule, decision-making model. Group choices are significantly more risky than the mean of the initial individual preferences when the potential loss is small, but no difference or slight conservative shifts are observed when the potential loss is relatively great. The majority-rule, decision-making model tested in this study proves fairly satisfactory. It appears, however, that actual group decisions are generally more risky than predicted by this model. It is suggested that changes in risk level following discussion can best be explained in terms of an interaction between majority influence and the social values associated with risky and conservative behavior.

      "Abstract: This paper discusses two models for describing an individual's binary choice probabilities between gambles whose outcomes are measured along a unidimensional scale on which a larger outcome is preferred to a smaller outcome. The models are based on a presumed underlying von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. They view each pair of gambles in an interlocking fashion rather than as two separate entities. The first model is an incremental expected utility advantage model which is proposed for the context in which gambles are presented to the individual in terms of their outcome probabilities without specific reference to chance events. The second model, an expected utility loss generalization of Edwards' RELM rule, is intended for contexts in which outcome probabilities are tied to designated chance events. The models are proposed in a tentative spirit. Data from previous studies lend some support to the models as descriptors of binary choice probabilities in gambling situations. © 1976.\u001b[0m :\n",

The study also showed an interaction between achievement motivation (Personality Research Form) and locus of control (Rotter's Internal-External Locus of Control Scale), and different situational dimensions. Results are explained in terms of attribution of responsibility and the idea that risk taking is intrinsically rewarding. Data also suggest the value of combining both situational and individual difference variables in attempting to understand the determinants of gambling or risk taking.

      "Abstract: This paper employs data from a “natural experiment,” the televised coverage of the Senate Watergate hearings, to examine several hypotheses which have been advanced concerning television viewer behavior. This paper postulates a more general theory of audience preferences and develops a model to represent separate groups of viewer's with distinct preference orderings for program types. The results indicate that the previously proposed hypotheses-the “passive viewer” and “first choice only” hypotheses-concerning viewer behavior are deficient. These results also suggest that television viewing can be increased by the addition of new alternatives if they are sufficiently dissimilar to programs presently being shown. The programming decisions of the three networks can be represented as strategies in economic games involving audience-maximizing, loss-minimizing, and cost-minimizing payoffs. Collective action by the networks to provide rotated coverage, a departure from the usual practice of providing simultaneous coverage of major news events, is an especially attractive solution to the cooperative form of these games. © 1976, Sage Publications.

In an ambiguous angle-matching task, one group of 13 10-year-old boys was told that they would earn points for each match correctly made; another 13 of their male classmates were told that they had 50 points at the start and would lose a point for each incorrect match made. Otherwise, the two situations were the same for all Ss. Point-losers took much longer to make their matches than point-gainers. The groups did not differ in their choice to repeat the task.

      "Abstract: The question of whether aversive outcomes are generally preferred at sooner or at later times in the future is examined. Theories predicting choices of advanced and deferred aversive outcomes are summarized. A previous result suggesting overwhelming preference for more immediate aversive outcomes is challenged on the basis of problems endemic to experimental studies of decision making. An experiment that attempted to circumvent those problems is described. Subjects chose between sums of money that could be lost at various times in the future.

      "Abstract: Employed a 2 × 2 × 3 factorial design to study conditions that influence members' evaluation of their own group's product and that of a competing group. Ss were 336 undergraduates. Group members were told that they either would or would not continue working together in future competitive confrontations with another group. After the competition, group members were informed that their product had either won or lost or that a decision about the winner had not yet been made. Ss were then asked to evaluate their own group's product and that of the competing group either in public or in private. Results show that in \"continuing\" groups, members of groups declared the winner showed less overevaluation of their own product when ratings were given in public than in private. The reverse effect was found in the losing groups. These effects were interpreted to result from Ss' desire to avoid complacency in winning groups and to avoid despair in losing groups. Ss in the \"discontinuing\" groups overevaluated their own group's product more in public than in private. This effect was found in winning as well as losing groups and was interpreted as showing Ss' desire to leave the group with a positive expression. The value of communication of group product evaluation is discussed in light of the obtained results.

      "Abstract: Describes a general selection model for selecting minority and majority applicants. The procedure consists of assigning utilities or losses to the \"consequences\" of selection decisions and deriving acceptance scores which maximize (minimize) the expected utility (loss). The question of \"unfair\" selection arises when applicants do not agree with the institution's utility (loss) assignment. 5 recently proposed models of fair selection are viewed in terms of an expected loss model and are shown to be procedures which implicitly assign loss values. It is concluded that utility (loss) values are always present in a selection problem, whether assigned explicitly or implicitly. Further, since applicants will probably never agree on a utility structure there cannot be a universal, fair, selection procedure.

      "Abstract: The nature of the correspondence between stages of moral reasoning about hypothetical dilemmas and stages of moral reasoning about an actual situation of civil disobedience was analyzed in terms of choice of action, ideology, and personal-social constructions for 310 undergraduates. About 66% of the students used a different stage of reasoning--46% higher and 20% lower--for the actual situation than they did for the hypothetical dilemmas. The patterns of gain accorded with the cognitive-moral theory's propositions concerning developmental readiness in young adults within a disequilibrating situation; action that supported ideology was also associated with gain. Loss, not predicted by the theory, characterized students whose action and ideology were inconsistent and whose personal constructions suggested special sensitivity to authority conflict. It is argued that cognitive-moral research needs to recognize that structures are often filtered through a variety of functions before they become manifest in either thought or action.

Attractiveness was closely related to the expected value of the bet. For both within- and between-condition comparisons, the average attractiveness decision of groups was higher than that for individuals when the expected value of the bet was positive, but was lower for bets with negative expected value; no significant shifts were observed when the expected value was equal to zero. In the various experimental conditions, the distribution of group decisions across the attractiveness scale was best described by a majority social decision scheme, and the accuracy of this model was independently supported by informal postsession questionnaire responses. A multiple regression analysis showed that groups weighted risk dimensions (win-loss probabilities and amounts) in toto more heavily than did individuals.

      "Abstract: Investigated the concept of risk and its role in determining preferences, using pairs of specifically constructed 3-outcome gambles. Ss were 47 undergraduates. The risk dimensions, probabilities of winning and losing, and amounts to be won or lost were different for each gamble in a pair, but the expected values and variances were approximately equal. The probability of losing was most important in determining judged risk. The likelihood that the more risky gamble in a pair would be chosen as the preferred gamble was related to the probability relationship within the gambles in a pair. The relative importance of the probabilities and amounts in preference choices was also contingent on the probability relationships. Amounts were more closely associated with preference choices when the probability of winning was greater than the probability of losing within each gamble, and the probabilities were more closely associated with the choices when the probability of winning was less than the probability of losing. The relevance of these findings to other theories of risk and the evidence for contingent processing of information in risky decision making are discussed.

This modification allows a richer structure within which decision analysis problems can be formulated and thus allows a richer foundation for developing new concepts, classifying problems and revising existing concepts such as perfect information. It is shown that the unique payoff relevant domain of states and acts must, in any real decision, provide the initial basis for defining any payoff function (or, as appropriate, the loss function and opportunity loss function) that has a domain other than pay-off-relevant states. © 1974 D.

If a loss function can be determined which associates a loss with every possible error of estimation or prediction, then the optimal estimator or predictor is that value which minimizes expected loss. In most applications, the loss function is assumed to be linear or quadratic in the error of estimation or prediction, although there are many practical situations in which these simple functions are quite inappropriate. In this paper, we investigate the properties of Bayesian point estimates under other loss functions; both the general case and two special cases (power and exponential loss functions) are considered. For the special cases, we also investigate the sensitivity of Bayesian point estimation and prediction to misspecification in the loss function and discuss the practical implications of the results. © 1974 Institute of Statistical Mathematics.\u001b[0m :\n",

The possible presence of an unidentified submarine presented an inexperienced government with a complicated set of strategic assessments. The choices made appear to have been based on an inadequate understanding of the chances of success as the latter were seriously circumscribed by the physical characteristics of the waters involved. Even if Norway had possessed the means of detecting and identifying the mystical submarine, serious doubts are raised about the wisdom of pursuing the maximalist objectives which the government announced. The decision-making in the crisis reflects little deliberate calculation of costs and risks, and did not focus on how losses could be cut when it became clear that the submarine would escape. The informa tion policy added to the perception of loss and tended to feed unrealistic expectations about what could be achieved. © 1974, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

Such a situation has been termed a commons dilemma by Lloyd in 1833; it is a variant of the well known prisoner's dilemma. The mathematical model of rational decision making when facing the commons dilemma implies the dismal conclusion that individuals acting rationally will end up by destroying, or nearly destroying, the common wealth.

      "Abstract: Suggests that the literature on individual decision making under risk is characterized by 2 approaches to the description of gambles. The 1st describes gambles as probability distributions over sets of outcomes. Models of decision making developed within this approach have concentrated on the moments of the distributions as the primary determinants of risky decision behavior. The 2nd approach describes gambles as multidimensional stimuli which may be conceptualized in terms of basic risk dimensions, (e.g., probability of winning, amount to win, probability of losing, and amount to lose). This approach views risky decision behavior as a form of information processing. The relative merits of explanations derived from each approach are discussed. It is argued that the risk dimension approach appears more promising than that based on moments of the underlying probability distribution.

No difference was found between the groups in choices among alternatives involving both gain and loss.

The decisions made on the basis of the single value estimate frequently fall short of optimal strategies because of costs that occur when actual sales differ from forecast sales. These costs, measured in terms of opportunity losses, can be minimized when considered in conjunction with a probability distribution of sales. Three methods for determining the probability distribution of sales are considered in this paper. These are regression analysis Schlaifer's approach for establishing a subjective distribution, and Bayesian regression.

On the evidence of this study and its predecessor, under conditions where answers are not restricted and 'leading' is kept to a minimum, this proportion appears to be about 12%. The specific forms of anxieties, and the myths, rumors, and remedies associated with them vary between cultures. The specific conclusions from this study are that more detailed preoperative counseling is required in Malaysia for future vasectomy candidates who have less than four or five children or have children of only one sex, and generally more explicit explanation of the fate of the sperm should be elaborated for all candidates in lectures and pamphlets.; 246 men, aged 21-59, living on rubber estates on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were interviewed 1-4 years after vasectomy in a study conducted by the International Institute for the Study of Human Reproduction of Columbia University and the National Family Planning Board of Malaysia. Most of the men were of Indian origin; 223 were Hindus. The incidence and nature of psychological and medical complications were investigated, but this article treats only the psychological effects. The basic interviews consisted of verbal questionnaires; care was taken to avoid drawing attention to the researchers' interest in psychosexual effects. Men claiming regrets, fears, ill effects, and problems in married life after the operation were 9%, 11%, 54%, and 4%, respectively, of the total population. 11.8% of the men claimed to have a loss of libido. The percentages of men expressing regrets and fears decreased with increasing age, parity, and pregnancies of wife; age here is probably the overriding variable. When the vasectomy decision was joint, rather than the individual decision of either husband or wife, regrets and fears were significantly less (p.05 for both regrets and fears). No couple in the sample was without at least 1 living son, this suggesting that men without heirs will refrain from vasectomy in Malaysia. Higher proportions of men who had lost children reported anxiety. Men reporting psychosexual complications were reinterviewed in depth. In these depth interviews a variety of fantasies associated with the operation was revealed.\u001b[0m :\n",

Following assessment of individual risk preferences on the choice-dilemmas task, 192 male undergraduates were assigned to 24 groups of leader-subordinate dyads and told to reach joint decisions on 1/2 the choice-dilemmas items. Recombination as all-leader and all-subordinate groups followed. For 1/2 of each of these combinations, leaders were negotiators and subordinates were Os; role assignments were reversed for the others. The negotiators' task was to achieve a consensus on all of the choice-dilemmas items both those with prior dyadic decisions and those without. Subordinate negotiators, relative to leader negotiators, consulted more with their former dyadic partner and more often failed to achieve consensus (deadlock). Subordinate Os advocated higher risk levels than their leader negotiators, whereas subordinate negotiators and leader Os did not differ in risk preferences. Prior issue commitment increased the difficulty of a negotiated agreement and decreased decision satisfaction. Generally, the presence of Os seemed to increase \"loss of face\" motivation in leaders and fears of sanction for deviation in subordinates. (24 ref.)

      "Abstract: In the first part, an attempt was made to construct an appropriate model of choice behavior in a two alternative choice situation so as to infer subjects' motives in the response dependent games (RDG) (Nakahara, 1967). The RDG in this experiment was a type of Prisoner's Dilemma game with one variable element of the payoff matrix contingent upon the subject's prior responses. The value of the variable element on the (n+1)th trial is determined both by its prior value and by the subject's response on the n th trial. The rules for the changing of the value of the variable element were: (1) when both subjects responded with a competitive choice, the value of the variable was decreased on the next trial: (2) when one or both subjects made a cooperative choice, the value of the variable was increased. Four possible models of choice behavior in such a RDG were considered, all assuming a Markov chain of the first order, and each implying a different motive on the part of the subjects. The four possible models were: (1) the Bimax model, implying a motive of coexistence and coprosperity; (2) the Nash model, implying a motive of securing minimum loss in any single situation taken separately ; (3) the Minimax model, implying a motive of securing a minimum loss ; and (4) the Max Difference model, implying a competitive motive. The payoff matrix in a RDG of this sort might display any one of the following five different types of trends in the trial sequences: (1) the A type, in which the variable would increase ; (2) the B type, in which the variable would oscillate near the upper limit of the Prisoner's Dilemma structure (PDS) ; (3) the C type, in which the variable would fluctuate irregularly in the PDS; (4) the D type, in which the variable would oscillate near the lower limit of PDS; (5) the E type, in which the variable would decrease continuously. It is to be noted that the four models are based on both the subject's motives and the five types of mathematical structure of the RDG. In order to see the relation between the models and the above mentioned types, a computer simulation was developed with the results as follows: (1) the Bimax model led to the B type change; (2) the Nash model led to the D type; (3) the Max Difference model led to the E type. No correspondence was obtained with the remaing models and the types of change. The second part of this study was concerned with “relativity of choice”. The term “relativity of choice” was meant to indicate that the same choice behavior would be obtained in the five payoff matrices each element of which were multiplication by a constant of the corresponding element of the standard matrix. Five groups were used in the experiment. Each group was composed of five pairs of males and five pairs of females. Two hundred trials were run in each case. Subjects were all students of Osaka City University; they were not allowed to communicate in the experiment and were not informed about the terminating conditions. The monetary payoff to subjects was not done. The results showed that: (1) in a choice behavior situation of this kind of RDG, “relativity of choice” held independently of the actual Payoff matrix; (2) the percentages of each type of changes mentioned earlier were as follows: B type 10%; C type 12%; D type 66%; E type 12%. A type was not seen. Since the D type was most frequent, it was concluded that the subjects' choice behavior was usually based on the motive of securing a minimum loss an instantaneous situation (Nash model). © 1972, The Japanese Psychological Association.

      "Abstract: Applied a theory of information integration to decision making with probabilistic events. 10 undergraduates judged the subjective worth of duplex bets that included independent gain and lose components. The worth of each component was assumed to be the product of a subjective weight that reflected the probability of winning or losing, and the subjective worth of the money to be won or lost. The total worth of the bet was the sum of the worths of the 2 components. Thus, each judgment required multiplying and adding operations. The multiplying model worked quite well in 4 experimental conditions. The adding model showed more serious discrepancies, though these were small in magnitude. The theory of functional measurement was applied to scale the subjective values of the probability and money stimuli. Subjective and objective values were nonlinearly related both for probability and for money. (33 ref.)

After every observation, the decision maker may either make a terminal decision and incur a terminal loss if he is incorrect or purchase another observation; his objective is to minimize subjectively expected loss. The optimal decision policy is presented and numerical results are given for Gaussian and exponential stimulus models. The theory is extended to the case where loss per observation varies from one trial to another.

      "Abstract: By-elections have always presented a particular challenge to the psephologist. The motivations of the non-voters are normally difficult to interpret and as the poll goes down so do the dimensions of the problem increase. Crude voting figures tempt the researcher to assume that change largely takes the form of a greater or lesser fall in the percentage shares of the enrolment of the different parties competing. The scale of its apparent losses to abstention therefore measures the standing of a party. Such thinking is perhaps a convenient form of journalistic shorthand. Not only does it largely ignore the role of the â€˜changersâ€™; it also assumes, explicitly or by inference, some kind of rational process, almost a decision to abstain, on the part of non-voters. In both these respects by-election commentary tends to ignore the findings of opinion surveys at general elections. Clearly there is a need to go behind the voting figures of a by-election and to assess the results in the light of the actual processes of change as measured by some form of survey. © 1968, SAGE Publications.

Examined the joint effects of uncertainty (H) and importance (I) on information search for 3 decision tasks and 2 types of importance (possible gain and loss). Ss were 54 male undergraduates. Results showed that mean search increased with H and was at a consistently higher level for high-importance conditions. There were no observable differences in the effects of gain and loss manipulations of I. The predicted multiplicative relationship between H and I failed to occur, but rather an additive effect was indicated. Post hoc analysis of H in high- and low-importance conditions suggested that this additive effect was a function of increases in H induced by I conditions. It appears that importance effects are in part mediated by uncertainty. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1969 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An investigation is described which attempts to determine, in a gambling situation, the effect of a player's previous play on (i) his choice of the next event outcome in a binary sequence; and (ii) the size of his stake placed on the next event outcome. In three separate experiments three age groups are studied viz. adults, 14-year-old boys, and 10-year-old boys and girls. All are given an initial 'capital' to play with and have to predict the colour at the next turn of a roulette wheel. The results indicate that the negative recency effect is more common after losing (incorrect guessing) than after winning, except in the youngest group the members of which seem more influenced by their own previous predictions than by the actual event outcome. Whether the stake is increased, decreased or remains the same, after winning and losing respectively, depends on what the players are evidently seeking to maximise. It appears that the oldest and youngest groups are attempting to maximise the utility of play, while the 14-year-old subjects are intent on minimising their losses. The different strategies of play employed by the subjects support the distinction which may be made between the idea of 'negative recency' and the so-called 'gambler's fallacy'. The latter as defined in the paper, cannot be predicted from the former. © 1969.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Two simple inequalities involving two parameters, expected terminal losses (expected losses due to wrong decisions), expected sampling losses, and optimal (Bayes) and non-optimal sample sizes are shown to hold for several fixed sample size decision problems. The two parameters depend on the type of loss structure assumed. One inequality relates to the division of total expected losses for a sample of optimal size between expected terminal losses and expected sampling losses. The other inequality gives upper bounds on the ratio of total expected losses at non-optimal sample sizes to those at the optimal sample size. The latter inequality shows that total expected losses are often quite insensitive to the use of non-optimal sample sizes; in conjunction with optimal sample size formulas, it can be used to show that total expected losses are also insensitive to the use of a “wrong” prior distribution or the wrong cost parameters. The inequalities are shown to hold for several two-action problems on the mean of a Normal process, ten quadratic loss estimation problems involving Normal, Bernoulli, and Poisson processes, and one linear loss estimation problem on the mean of a Normal process; in each of these problems, a conjugate prior distribution is assumed. The inequalities are established by verifying two ad hoc conditions on expected terminal losses as a function of the sample size, which are proved to be sufficient for the inequalities. Optimal sample sizes for most of the problems considered have been given by Raiffa and Schlaifer [10]. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

There were two between group variables, the level of risk and the probability that risk taking would result in a gain. This probability was contingent upon the value of the known payoff. At all three contingent probabilities, when the known payoff was +1, more risks were taken at the high than at the low risk level. When the known payoff was -1, less risks were taken at the high than at the low risk level. The results were considered in terms of two models for choice behavior. © 1965.\u001b[0m :\n",

Immediately following this reaction-time game, 1 of the rewarded groups and 1 of the nonrewarded groups played a series of 60 consecutive Prisoner's Dilemma games, a task in which one may either cooperate or compete. A comparison of Ss who were rewarded during the reaction-time game with Ss who had no previous experience within the dyad indicated that the rewards received during the initial task increased the probability of a cooperative response during the Prisoner's Dilemma game, and that this effect persevered over time. The results also indicated that losses sustained during the reaction-time game did not increase or decrease the number of cooperative responses in the group tested immediately but did increase such responses in the group tested 1 wk. later.

This interpretation was further reinforced by the findings observed for other experimental conditions, which effectively ruled out the alternative possibilities that greater risk taking ensued from its social desirability in a male sample or derived from affiliative propensities in a context where group members expected to experience aversive consequences in the company of like-minded others.

However, frequency of A1 was an increasing negatively accelerated function of the amount of gain and a decreasing negatively accelerated function of the amount of loss associated with A1.

      "Abstract: This study examined the mental construal process believed to be responsible for event valence. In three studies, respondents were exposed to future events, varying in their gains or losses, and asked to estimate the mental construal process and subsequent temporal perceptions or choices. The gains versus losses could be construed distinctly. People receiving gains were more likely to construe the event at a high rather than a low level of thinking. Therefore, people facing gains perceived the future time interval as longer than those facing losses and relied more on desirability rather than feasibility attributes.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The objective of this study is to estimate leakages in tourism systems. More precisely, the study aims to investigate the sources of the annual requirements in the resorts and to identify the triggers for leakages in tourism systems in Zanzibar. It then seeks to explore the challenges that operators face when sourcing the inputs locally. Likewise the study seeks to trace the distribution channel of the tourists arriving in Zanzibar from generating markets. Design/methodology/approach: Interviews involving 150 resorts were conducted during 2010 in the island of Unguja, where almost 97 percent of Zanzibar's resorts are found. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis were employed. Findings: The findings reveal massive internal (import-coefficient leakages) and external leakages that only 16 percent of the resort requirements are sourced within Zanzibar. Unreliable capacity in terms of quantity and quality of the local supplies are among the leading factors that trigger high leakages. Most resorts in Zanzibar are owned, managed and operated by non-locals. Tourism in this archipelago is revolving around the beach product; whereby the direct charter inclusive tourists, mainly from Europe, dictate the tourism channels. Nevertheless, a number of tourists buy pre-arranged tours to Zanzibar as an \"add-on\" to their mainland Tanzania safaris. Practical implications: This study lays out the case for the need for more local linkages in the supply chain by revealing the extent to which the accommodation sector depends upon imported as opposed to local goods and services. Practical strategies to minimize leakages are proposed. Originality/value: An abundance of literature has been written on linkages and leakages in tourism in several destinations. The same amount of work has yet to be done in sub-Saharan Africa. The choice of Zanzibar is therefore justified. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This case-based study describes three foster children in the US, who decided to be called by a new first name at a time when hopes of reunification were fading and parental rights were being terminated. Two children decided on their own to be called by a different first name. The third child accepted the idea, which was suggested by her foster mother. Children embraced the name changes because they felt lost and wanted to fit in. For two children, the decision represented an extreme defence. With the name change, the children were able to ward off extreme anxiety and pain set in train by the impending decision about termination, but they also cut themselves off prematurely from their identities and from powerful attachment feelings. Encouraged in therapy to talk about feelings and memories associated with her real name, the third child was better able to integrate past and present, and to move forward. A sudden decision on the part of a foster child to be called by a new first name should alert others to the possible precarious state of the child’s sense of identity and attachment relationships. Helping the child in therapy to access, explore and experience feelings about the name change may have important benefits in integration and help to avoid identity foreclosure. © 2013, © The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Our aim was to investigate the cognitive neural basis, the behavioral characteristics, and the cognitive process of decision making with a group of 30 healthy Chinese adults. Two conditions with tasks drawn from prospect theory allowed us to examine how different risky decisions and related behaviors activate specific brain regions. Participants completed 2 decision tasks in which the amount of possible monetary gain and loss differed. Event-related potentials recorded for analysis during these tasks involved the N2 and P3 components. Participants' behaviors showed risk aversion in the monetary gain condition and risk seeking in the loss condition. Reaction time for risk-seeking decisions in a loss condition was significantly slower than for the same decision in a gain condition. The reactions to uncertainty shared a general neural network, but reactions were activated with different intensities in certain brain regions. © Society for Personality Research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Disadvantageous decision-making has been reported in patients who had attempted suicide and may represent a cognitive risk factor for suicide. Making decisions necessitates both implicit/associative and explicit/analytic processes. Here, we explored explicit mechanisms, and hypothesized that suicide attempters fail to use explicit understanding to make favorable choices. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to assess decision-making in 151 non-depressed patients with a history of mood disorder and suicidal act, 81 non-depressed patients with a history of mood disorders but no suicidal act, and 144 healthy individuals. After performing the task, we assessed the explicit understanding of the participants of the contingencies in the task, i.e. which options yielded higher gain or loss. Correct explicit understanding was reported less often in suicide attempters and affective controls than in healthy controls (45.7% and 42.0% vs. 66.0%). Moreover, understanding was associated with better performance in healthy and affective controls, but not in suicide attempters, with no between-group difference among those who did not reach understanding. Patients with histories of suicide attempt, therefore, show a disconnection between what they \"know\" and what they \"do\", possibly reflecting underlying impairments in implicit associative processes. These cognitive alterations should be addressed in preventative interventions targeting suicide. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One of the key drivers in the emergence of civil engineering systems in the 1960s as a field of discourse was the potential of developing greater engineering understanding using a range of systems models and the need for better engineering decisions and outcomes. Important engineering decisions generally fall into two types. Those that seek to minimise losses such as those associated with very low probability and high consequence catastrophic outcomes and those that seek to maximise opportunity between competing options. This short essay concerns the latter. The assessment of large-scale, wide impact engineering decisions has proved problematic. This stems from a number of factors. There are often many non-monetary impacts, the systems boundaries (in space and time) are not clear, the stakes are high and there are many stakeholders (some of whom are not involved in the decision process). All these factors mean that the use of Cost-Benefit analysis as a decision-making criterion is controversial, ambiguous and in some cases inappropriate. In addition, there are often other non-monetary factors to be considered. The consequence is that long-term infrastructure decisions get bogged down or deferred and the default decision is to do nothing. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Competitive behavior is commonly defined as the decision to maximize one's payoffs relative to others. We argue instead that competitive drive derives from a desire for social status. We make use of a multi-player auction task in which subjects knowingly incur financial losses for the sake of winning auctions. First, we show that overbidding is increased when the task includes members of a rival out-group, suggesting that social identity is an important mediator of competitiveness. In addition, we show that the extent that individuals are willing to incur losses is related to affective responses to social comparisons but not to monetary outcomes. Second, we show that basal levels of testosterone predict overbidding, and that this effect of testosterone is mediated by affective responses to social comparisons. Based on these findings, we argue that competitive behavior should be conceptualized in terms of social motivations as opposed to just relative monetary payoffs. © 2013 van den Bos, Golka, Effelsberg and McClure.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is the most widely instrument used in the assessment of affective decision-making in several populations with frontal impairment. The standard performance measure on the IGT is obtained by calculating the difference between the advantageous and the disadvantageous choices. This standard score does not allows the assessment of the use of different strategies to deal with contingencies of gain and losses across the task. This study aims to compare the standard score method used in IGT with a method that analyses the patterns of staying and shifting among different decks across the 100 choices, considering contingencies of choices with and without losses. We compared the IGT performance of 24 children with externalizing disorders (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Oppositional Defiant Disorder) and 24 healthy age-matched children. The analyses of the standard score across all blocks failed to show differences among children with externalizing disorders and control children. However, healthy children showed a pattern of shifting more from disadvantageous decks to advantageous decks and choosing more consecutive cards from the advantageous decks across all blocks, independently of the contingency of losses. On the other hand, children with externalizing disorders presented a pattern of shifting more from advantageous decks to disadvantageous ones in comparison to healthy children and repeatedly chose cards from the B deck across all blocks. This findings show that even though differences among groups might not be found when using the standard analyses, a different type of analysis might be able to show distinct strategies on the execution of the test. © 2013 Sallum, Mata, Miranda and Malloy-Diniz.\u001b[0m :\n",

It makes product decisions using the sample mean of survey responses. When firms and consumers agree on the fraction of sincere consumers, information loss is severe, and many products are flops as they poorly match consumer tastes. When beliefs differ, however, equilibrium is in linear strategies, and information aggregates. Despite this, flops still arise. A firm, however, can solve the flops problem by limiting the effect of strategic consumers. Binary surveys offer one such solution. © 2014, RAND.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When designing contests to motivate employees, should managers organize employees to compete in teams or as individuals? We develop a behavioral economics model that shows that if contestants are averse to being responsible for the team's loss, a team-based (TB) contest can yield higher effort than an individual-based (IB) contest. This prediction is contrary to those of standard economics models, which favor IB contests over TB contests. We test the competing predictions using laboratory economics experiments. The results show that when contestants do not know each other, average effort levels in the TB and IB contests are not different. When contestants are allowed to socialize with potential teammates before making effort decisions, TB contests yield higher effort relative to IB contests. We also show that the relative efficacy of TB contests is driven by contestants' aversion to letting their team down. © 2013 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the functional anatomy of decision-making during the Iowa Gambling Task in patients with Parkinson's disease. We used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a computerized version of IGT to compare 18 PD patients on dopaminergic medication in the ON state and 18 healthy control subjects. Our analyses focused on outcome evaluation following card selection, because we expected this aspect of decision-making to be impaired in PD patients. The PD patients exhibited lower activation of the left putamen than the control group as a reaction to penalty. Using psychophysiological interaction analysis, we identified decreased functional connectivity between the right globus pallidus internus and the left anterior cingulate gyrus in the PD group. In contrast, increased connectivity between these structures was observed after penalty in the control group. Our results suggest altered functioning of the basal ganglia and their connections with the cortical structures involved in the limbic loop (e.g., the limbic fronto-striatal circuit of the basal ganglia) during decision-making in PD patients. Differences in the response to loss could be associated with insufficient negative reinforcement after a loss in PD patients in the ON state in comparison to a healthy population. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Italia.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: As goal orientation shifts across adulthood from a primary orientation toward gains to an increased importance of the prevention of losses, older adults' information processing may be particularly sensitive to potential losses if there is a possibility of avoiding them. In line with these motivational changes, we expected older adults to remember more loss-related information when choosing between 2 options than when not having to make a decision and when compared with younger adults. Using an incidental memory paradigm, we asked younger and older adults to recall as much information as possible of 2 previously presented hypothetical travel packages (Experiment 1) or 2 hospitals (Experiment 2) containing positive (gain-related), negative (loss-related), and neutral information in either a decision or a control condition (evaluating the readability of the texts). Experiment 1 showed that older adults remembered more negative information than younger adults and more negative than positive information in the choice but not in the control condition. Experiment 2 followed the same procedure using a choice between 2 hospitals for minor surgery. This choice was assumed to trigger a stronger orientation toward the prevention of losses than the choice between travel packages. As expected, in this situation, both age groups remembered more negative information relative to neutral and positive information regardless of the condition (choice vs. control). Importantly, older adults remembered more negative information in the choice condition compared with younger adults. Taken together, results suggest that the processing of decision-relevant information promotes a stronger focus on negative information in older adults. © 2013 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The summer of 2010-2011 was characterised by extreme weather events in Queensland. In late December 2010 and early January 2011, heavy rainfall produced a series of floods across the state. Three quarters of the state was declared a disaster zone and many thousands of people were evacuated from their homes. Brisbane city experienced the worst floods since 1974. Three cyclones crossed the coast; including the category 5 Cyclone Yasi. These events had a devastating impact on the tourist industry. However, some revenue losses may have been offset by geographical or temporal gains if tourists had changed their destination (destination substitution) or delayed their holiday plans and went to the same intended destination at a later date (temporal substitution). A survey of Brisbane residents was conducted in August 2012 to explore the impacts of the 2010-2011 weather events on their holiday plans and to examine the impacts of destination or temporal substitution. Contrary to expectations, the results indicated the holiday plans of 84 per cent of Brisbane survey respondents were unaffected by the 2010-2011 weather events and there was greater prevalence of temporal substitution than destination substitution. © 2013 Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Millions of minority homeowners are at risk of losing their homes as a result of the housing crisis due to mortgage foreclosure and home repossession. One consumer-oriented policy response to this crisis is mortgage default counseling for borrowers. This study examines the rate at which minority borrowers seek default counseling and the resulting correlation between counseling and the probability that a borrower obtains a modification of his/her original mortgage contract terms. The results suggest that African Americans are more likely to be counseled, relative to Whites. However, Latinos or other non-White groups are no more or less likely to be counseled. The probability of loan modifications among counseled African Americans is also higher than other counseled borrowers. These results suggest that counseling policies and the public subsidy of default counseling may be one approach for promoting consumer financial well-being of these households, but also suggest counseling efforts might be better designed for other minority groups. These results also have implications for the application of counseling to other mortgage decisions, such as refinance. © 2013 by The American Council on Consumer Interests.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: To assess the awareness level of the Jordanian general population regarding the definition, risk factors, signs and symptoms, and consequences of stroke. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The questionnaire was handed to participants by trained students, the participants were chosen randomly from public places, and the questionnaire used is subdivided into demographic data, questions of multiple choices to identify symptoms and signs, the definition of stroke, and risk factors of stroke. The data were entered and analysed by SPSS software version 16.using frequencies, Chi square and logistic regression. A level of significance of 0.05 was applied. Results: At least 1993 questionnaires were returned. Out which 40 were excluded for poor quality and 99 were excluded due to missing data. From the 1854 questionnaire used, 82% were residents of Amman, and only 17% were older than 47 years of age. Females were almost equally represented as males,who accounted for 57% of the total. More than 70% had an educational level higher than secondary school. Only 1.5% experienced a previous stroke, and a relatively high proportion (63.8%) knew someone who suffered from stroke. The most recognized symptom was speech loss (54.7%). All other symptoms were recognized by < 50% of the population. Seventy five percent knew that the brain is the organ involved in stroke while 85% would contact the ambulance on noticing stroke signs, even if symptoms subsequently improved. In a bivariate logistic regression, no independent variables had true effect on knowledge. Conclusion: We concluded from the study that there are serious gaps in knowledge regarding stroke; an educational program on stroke may help reduce the stroke burden in Jordan. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.

      "Abstract: Cyber security often depends on decisions made by human operators, who are commonly considered a major cause of security failures. We conducted 2 behavioral experiments to explore whether and how cyber security decision-making responses depend on gain-loss framing and salience of a primed recall prior experience. In Experiment I, we employed a 2 × 2 factorial design, manipulating the frame (gain vs. loss) and the presence versus absence of a prior near-miss experience. Results suggest that the experience of a near-miss significantly increased respondents' endorsement of safer response options under a gain frame. Overall, female respondents were more likely to select a risk averse (safe) response compared with males. Experiment II followed the same general paradigm, framing all consequences in a loss frame and manipulating recall to include one of three possible prior experiences: false alarm, near-miss, or a hit involving a loss of data. Results indicate that the manipulated prior hit experience significantly increased the likelihood of respondents' endorsement of a safer response relative to the manipulated prior near-miss experience. Conversely, the manipulated prior false-alarm experience significantly decreased respondents' likelihood of endorsing a safer response relative to the manipulated prior near-miss experience. These results also showed a main effect for age and were moderated by respondent's income level. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, CPT's full function had not yet been quantified in the health domain. This paper is therefore the first to simultaneously measure utility of life duration, probability weighting, and loss aversion in this domain.We observe loss aversion and risk aversion for gains and losses, which for gains can be explained by probabilistic pessimism. Utility for gains is almost linear. For losses, we find less weighting of probability 1/2 and concave utility. This contrasts with the common finding of convex utility for monetary losses. However, CPT was proposed to explain choices among lotteries involving monetary outcomes. Life years are arguably very different from monetary outcomes and need not generate convex utility for losses. Moreover, utility of life duration reflects discounting, causing concave utility. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although major depression is projected to be among the top three causes of disability-adjusted life years lost in 2030, relatively little is known concerning the extent to which depressed mood states can bias social-economic decision making away from optimal outcomes. One experimental framework to study the interaction between negative emotion and social-economic decisions is the ultimatum game (UG), where the fair, cooperative player altruistically punishes the unfair, non-cooperative player. To assess a potential susceptibility of altruistic punishment to depressed mood, we repeatedly administered the UG task to a cohort of 20 currently depressed patients with a diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder and 20 healthy controls. Furthermore, valence and arousal ratings of emotionally laden pictures were obtained from all participants in order to assess a depressed mood-related distortion of emotion judgments. Compared to healthy controls, depressed patients over-sanctioned unfair proposals in the UG and judged emotional stimuli too negatively. Thus, major depression is associated with a negative emotional bias that hampers social-economic decision making and produces large personal costs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, the impact of sensor faults within smart structures is investigated using seismic fragility analysis techniques. Seismic fragility analysis is one of the methods used to evaluate the vulnerability of structural systems under a broad range of earthquake events. It would play an important role in estimating seismic losses and in the decision making process based on vibration control performance of the smart structures during seismic events. In this study, a three-story building employing a highly nonlinear hysteretic magnetorheological (MR) damper is analyzed to estimate the seismic fragility of the smart control system. Different levels of sensor damage scenarios for smart structures are considered to provide a better understanding of the expected fragility estimates due to the impact of sensor failures. Probabilistic demand models are constructed with a Bayesian updating approach while the seismic capacity of smart structures is estimated based on the approximate structural performance of semi-actively controlled structures. Peak ground acceleration (PGA) of ground motion is used as a measure of earthquake intensity. Then the fragility curves for the smart structures are developed and compared with those for the semi-active control systems with different levels of sensor damage scenarios. The responses of an uncontrolled structure are used as a baseline. It is shown from the simulations that the proposed methodology is effective in quantifying the impact of sensor faults within smart structures. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Our objective was to understand the range of parental views on whether and how to approach the issue of SUDEP with families, to clarify the optimal timing and formulation of the information, and to learn from parents the optimal counseling strategies in order to minimize the inherent emotional burden. Methods: The principles of fundamental qualitative description were used to guide this descriptive and exploratory study of parental experiences and perceptions. Stratified purposeful sampling included parents (i) who lost children to SUDEP, (ii) of children with moderate to severe epilepsy, (iii) of children with mild epilepsy, and (iv) of children with new-onset epilepsy. Focus group and in-depth one-on-one interviews were conducted. The principles of directed content analysis were used to code and categorize the focus group and interview data. Key concepts from the interview guide were used as the first level of coding categories. Codes were subsequently collapsed into broader categories. Results: There was full agreement, across both genders and regardless of seizure severity, that routine counseling about SUDEP should be provided by pediatric neurologists, during the appointment when the diagnosis of epilepsy is shared with parents, and with opportunities for short-term follow-up and discussions with clinical nurses or social workers. Parents described feeling overwhelmed, worried, and increasingly anxious when the risk of SUDEP was explained to them. Parents generally expressed a preference for receiving routine SUDEP counseling at the time of the diagnosis of epilepsy. Across all groups of parents, it was identified that SUDEP counseling should occur in a face-to-face interaction with the neurologist. In learning about SUDEP, parents expressed a need to be informed of the risk of SUDEP. There was group endorsement for receiving written information about SUDEP to reinforce the content shared by the neurologist. There was a consensus that it should be the parents' decision as to whether or not the child should be present at the meeting or when to inform the child about the risk of SUDEP. Conclusion: Participants in this study opined that all parents of children with epilepsy should receive routine SUDEP counseling and have access to ongoing professional support. Based on these findings, it is imperative for pediatric neurologists to refine their communication skills when counseling parents about SUDEP. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: To explore nursing home relocation experiences of overseas-born, culturally and linguistically diverse elderly. Methods: Using a grounded theory approach, interviews were conducted with 20 residents of four nursing homes in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia. Results: Consistent with the grounded theory method, the initial objectives of exploring the participants' nursing home relocation experience focused on the pathways they had taken en route to nursing homes and the strategies used to bring their cultures with them. Conclusion: Participants made little suggestion that culture was an important consideration in their decision making about responding to loss or moving to the nursing home until they began discussing offers of care from their family. Cultural considerations are important factors in assessing the quality of a nursing home and in strategies used for settling into the home. Notably, many of the cultural practices and meanings described by residents were common to many cultures and were experienced by older adults as culturally meaningful. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The framing effect, identified by Tversky and Kahneman, is one of the most striking cognitive biases, in which people react differently to a particular choice depending whether it is presented as a loss or as a gain. Numerous studies have subsequently demonstrated the robustness of the framing effect in a variety of contexts, especially in medical decision-making. Compared to daily decisions, medical decisions are of low frequency but of paramount importance. The framing effect is a well-documented bias in a variety of studies, but research is inconsistent regarding whether and how variables influence framing effects in medical decision-making. To clarify the discrepancy in the previous literature, published literature in the English language concerning the framing effect was retrieved using electronic and bibliographic searches. Two reviewers examined each article for inclusion and evaluated the articles' methodological quality. The framing effect in medical decision-making was reviewed in these papers. No studies identified an influence of framing information upon compliance with health recommendations, and different studies demonstrate different orientations of the framing effect. Because so many variables influence the presence or absence of the framing effect, the unexplained heterogeneity between studies suggests the possibility of a framing effect under specific conditions. Further research is needed to determine why the framing effect is induced and how it can be precluded. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study examines whether environmental migrants in Bangladesh move permanently or temporarily. The analyses are based on data collected in 2010 and 2011, and cover four themes, namely migrant characteristics, environmental change related factors, conflict and adaptation strategies, and social networks. The estimates obtained from binary logit models show that most sets of variables have statistically significant impacts on the temporary migration versus permanent migration decision. Females are more inclined to migrate temporarily, a finding which is consistent with prior studies that argued that female migration is one temporary household survival strategy in the face of an environmental crisis. The probability of intending to move temporarily is significantly affected by the prior occupational experience: Migrants who were previously engaged in agriculture or fishing are more inclined to migrate permanently. Those households who reported that they had lost assets due to environmental hazards are shown to have a higher probability of becoming permanent migrants. In contrast, loss of livestock and crop failure are associated with a greater likelihood of temporary migration. The empirical results reveal the groups that can be targeted in destination regions in settlement policy, and equally the groups whose return home can be facilitated once any immediate danger has passed. © 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many resource allocation contests have the property that individuals undertake costly actions to appropriate a potentially divisible resource. We design an experiment to compare individuals' decisions across three resource allocation contests which are isomorphic under risk-neutrality. The results indicate that in aggregate the single-prize contest generates lower expenditures than either the proportional-prize or the multi-prize contest. Interestingly, while the aggregate results indicate similar behavior in the proportional-prize and multi-prize contests, individual level analysis indicates that the behavior in the single-prize contest is more similar to the behavior in the multi-prize contest than in the proportional-prize contest. We also elicit preferences toward risk, ambiguity and losses, and find that while such preferences cannot explain individual behavior in the proportional-prize contest, preferences with regard to losses are predictive of behavior in both the single-prize and multiple-prize contests. Therefore, it appears that loss aversion is correlated with behavior in the single-prize and multi-prize contests where losses are likely to occur, but not in the proportional-prize contest where losses are unlikely. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The ubiquity of psychological process models requires an increased degree of sophistication in the methods and metrics that we use to evaluate them. We contribute to this venture by capitalizing on recent work in cognitive science analyzing response dynamics, which shows that the bearing information processing dynamics have on intended action is also revealed in the motor system. This decidedly \"embodied\" view suggests that researchers are missing out on potential dependent variables with which to evaluate their models-those associated with the motor response that produces a choice. The current work develops a method for collecting and analyzing such data in the domain of decision making. We first validate this method using widely normed stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (Experiment 1), and demonstrate that curvature in response trajectories provides a metric of the competition between choice options. We next extend the method to risky decision making (Experiment 2) and develop predictions for three popular classes of process model. The data provided by response dynamics demonstrate that choices contrary to the maxim of risk seeking in losses and risk aversion in gains may be the product of at least one \"online\" preference reversal, and can thus begin to discriminate amongst the candidate models. Finally, we incorporate attentional data collected via eye-tracking (Experiment 3) to develop a formal computational model of joint information sampling and preference accumulation. In sum, we validate response dynamics for use in preferential choice tasks and demonstrate the unique conclusions afforded by response dynamics over and above traditional methods. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Non-contagious, chronic disease has been identified as a global health risk. Poor lifestyle choices, such as smoking, alcohol, drug and solvent abuse, physical inactivity, and unhealthy diet have been identified as important factors affecting the increasing incidence of chronic disease. The following focuses on the circumstance affecting the lifestyle or behavioral choices of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in remote-/very remote Australia. Poor behavioral choices are the result of endogenous characteristics that are influenced by a range of stressful exogenous variables making up the psychosocial determinants including social disenfranchisement, cultural loss, insurmountable tasks, the loss of volitional control and resource constraints. It is shown that poor behavioral choices can be economically rational; especially under highly stressful conditions. Stressful circumstances erode individual capacity to commit to long-term positive health alternatives such as self-investment in education. Policies directed at removing the impediments and providing incentives to behaviors involving better health choices can lead to reductions in smoking and alcohol consumption and improved health outcomes. Multijurisdictional culturally acceptable policies directed at distal variables relating to the psychosocial determinants of health and personal mastery and control can be cost effective. While the content of this paper is focused on the conditions of colonized peoples, it has broader relevance. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decision-making deficits are thought to play an important role in the development and persistence of substance use disorders. Individual differences in decision-making abilities and their underlying neurocircuitry may, therefore, constitute an important predictor for the course of substance use and the development of substance use disorders. Here, we investigate the predictive value of decision making and neural mechanisms underlying decision making for future cannabis use and problem severity in a sample of heavy cannabis users. Brain activity during a monetary decision-making task (Iowa gambling task) was compared between 32 heavy cannabis users and 41 matched non-using controls using functional magnetic resonance imaging. In addition, within the group of heavy cannabis users, associations were examined between task-related brain activations, cannabis use and cannabis use-related problems at baseline, and change in cannabis use and problem severity after a 6-month follow-up. Despite normal task performance, heavy cannabis users compared with controls showed higher activation during wins in core areas associated with decision making. Moreover, within the group of heavy cannabis users, win-related activity and activity anticipating loss outcomes in areas generally involved in executive functions predicted change in cannabis use after 6 months. These findings are consistent with previous studies and point to abnormal processing of motivational information in heavy cannabis users. A new finding is that individuals who are biased toward immediate rewards have a higher probability of increasing drug use, highlighting the importance of the relative balance between motivational processes and regulatory executive processes in the development of substance use disorders. © 2012 The Authors, Addiction Biology © 2012 Society for the Study of Addiction.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although trait anxiety has been associated with risk decision making, whether it is related to risk per se or to the feeling of the risk, as well as the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms, remains unclear. Using a decision-making task with a manipulation of frame (i.e., written description of options as a potential gain or loss) and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neurocognitive relationship between trait anxiety and decision making. The classic framing effect was observed: participants chose the safe option when it was described as a potential gain, but they avoided the same option when it was described as a potential loss. Most importantly, trait anxiety was positively correlated with this behavioral bias. Trait anxiety was also positively correlated with amygdala-based \"emotional\" system activation and its coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) when decisions were consistent with the framing effect, but negatively correlated with the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)-based \"analytic\" system activation and its connectivity to the vmPFC when decisions ran counter to the framing effect. Our findings suggest that trait anxiety is not associated with subjective risk preference but an evaluative bias of emotional information in decision making, underpinned by a hyperactive emotional system and a hypoactive analytic system in the brain. ©2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Cities all over the world rebrand themselves in order to refresh their image and attract/continue attracting tourists, industry or whichever group they hope to engage. Cities have tended to rebrand themselves based on varied social events and festivals such as fashion (Milan), food and beverages (Munich), folklore dancing (Rio de Janeiro), film (Cannes) and many more. The most powerful platform for rebranding a city is hosting the Olympic Games. Despite the fact that many city planners and decision-makers tend to perceive the Olympic Games as the highest yielding investment for reinforcing a city image, in the last three decades many host cities have lost millions of dollars, with this rare opportunity to leverage their city's image becoming one big fiasco. The aim of this paper is to present the key rules for making hosting the Olympic Games a very profitable business, in terms of reinforcing the city image. Design/methodology/approach: Since some host cities are more established in economic terms and some are less, two different approaches (the \"Barcelona model\" and the \"London model\") are discussed. Findings: The Barcelona model shows how a city can leverage its image, based on the Olympic Games, to become more familiar to millions of potential tourists, and the London model shows how an entire country can also profit from the fact that its capital is hosting the Olympic Games. Originality/value: The Barcelona model shows how a city can leverage its image, based on the Olympic Games, to become more familiar to millions of potential tourists, and the London model shows how an entire country can also profit from the fact that its capital is hosting the Olympic Games. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In our daily life, it is very common to make decisions in uncertain situations. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used in laboratory studies because of its good simulation of uncertainty in real life activities. The present study aimed to examine the neural correlates of uncertain decision making with the IGT. Twenty-six university students completed this study. An adapted IGT was administered to them, and the EEG data were recorded. The adapted IGT we used allowed us to analyze the choice evaluation, response selection, and feedback evaluation stages of uncertain decision making within the same paradigm. In the choice evaluation stage, the advantageous decks evoked larger P3 amplitude in the left hemisphere, while the disadvantageous decks evoked larger P3 in the right hemisphere. In the response selection stage, the response of \"pass\" (the card was not turned over; the participants neither won nor lost money) evoked larger negativity preceding the response compared to that of \"play\" (the card was turned over; the participant either won or lost money). In the feedback evaluation stage, feedback-related negativity (FRN) was only sensitive to the valence (win/loss) but not the magnitude (large/small) of the outcome, and P3 was sensitive to both the valence and the magnitude of the outcome. These results were consistent with the notion that a positive somatic state was represented in the left hemisphere and a negative somatic state was represented in the right hemisphere. There were also anticipatory ERP effects that guided the participants' responses and provided evidence for the somatic marker hypothesis with more precise timing. © 2013 Cui, Chen, Wang, Shum and Chan.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Obesity has been described as an epidemic and a major public health concern globally. Distorted self-perceived weight status can negatively impact an individual's decision to lose weight as well as adoption of healthful weight management attitudes. This study described self-perceived weight status among adults working in civil service departments in Tamale, Ghana, and compared it to their classification based on WHR. It also examined associations of distorted self-perceived weight status with weight loss attitudes, socio-demographic variables and knowledge levels on the health effects of overweight and obesity. Methods: This cross-sectional study was undertaken from January 2011 to July 2011 among a sample of 186 civil servants living in Tamale. Out of the sample, 121 were men and 65 were women. Participants' self-perceived weight status, socio-demographic and weight loss attitudes were assessed by means of a 10-item questionnaire. Participants' waist and hip circumferences were measured with appropriate tools and computed into waist hip ratio (WHR) and classified based on WHO classifications. Results: More than 80% of the participants were aged below 40 years. Generally, 56.5% (n = 105) participants had normal weight and 31.2% (n = 58) were centrally obese. The proportion of participants being centrally obese was higher in women compared to men (p < 0.0001). Forty four percent of the studied population had a distorted self-perceived weight status. Less than10% of participants self-perceived themselves as overweight/obese, in which over 47% were, in fact, overweight/obese as measured by WHR. Factors associated with distorted self-perceived weight status were being overweight/obese (Crude OR = 97.3; (35.8-264.6; p < 0.0001), aged < 40 years (Crude OR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-6.5; p = 0.0102) and having inadequate knowledge on the health effects of overweight/obesity (Crude OR = 3.7; CI = 1.3-11.0; p = 0.0114). Weight loss attitudes and methods used to lose weight were not significantly associated to self-perceived weight status and WHR measured weight status. Conclusions: Self-perceived and WHR measured weight status of participants did not conform. Distorted self-perceived weight status was not associated to weight loss attitudes but to being overweight/obese, being younger (<40 years) and having inadequate knowledge on the health effects of overweight/obesity. Educating people on accurate weight perception and the health effects of overweight/obesity should be considered in designing public health strategies to curb the rising prevalence of overweight/obesity and other non-communicable diseases in Ghana. © 2013 Mogre et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Behavioral studies demonstrate that the timing of receiving gains or losses affects decision-making, a phenomenon known as temporal discounting, as participants are inclined to prefer immediate rewards over delayed ones and vice versa for losses. The present study used the event-related potential technique with a simple gambling task to investigate how delayed rewards and losses affected the brain activity in outcome evaluations made by 20 young adults. Statistical analysis revealed a larger feedback-related negativity (FRN) effect between loss and gain following immediate outcomes than following future outcomes. In addition, delay impacted FRN only in gain conditions, with delayed winning eliciting a more negative FRN than immediate winning. These results suggest that temporal discounting and sign effect could be encoded in the FRN in the early stage of outcome evaluation. © 2013 Qu, Huang, Wang and Huang.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigates individuals' preferences toward protection programs aimed at increasing the chances of survival of the two distinct Eurasian lynx populations in Poland. Those two groups, the Lowland and the Carpathian population, are exposed to different risks of extinction as they have different numbers, different-sized areas of occupation and different migration possibilities. Using a discrete choice experiment we examine the influence of the initial degree of endangerment on the allocation of respondents' funds. The results show that people prefer to invest in the conservation of the lynx population, which has initially lower chances of survival. The main driver of respondents' choices seems to be loss aversion rather than the urge to invest in an option with an expected higher outcome. This observation can be interpreted as people trying to keep all the options - doors - open by devoting more funds to the more vulnerable population than to the more stable one. Employing a scale-extended latent class model allowed us to detect segments among individuals showing different types of response behavior, including a form of serial non-participation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We study the effect of information aggregation on individual investors' risk-taking behavior in two experiments, each having three different treatments. Subjects in the control group were given hypothetical returns for both the risk-free and the risky asset. Subjects in the account group were also given information about returns separately for each of the two assets. However, this information was scaled according to a subject's chosen investment amount. Subjects in the portfolio group could observe returns on a portfolio level, which constitutes the highest level of information aggregation in our study. Results show that a higher degree of information aggregation results in greater risk-taking. Increased risk-taking is associated with a lower risk perception and a more accurate estimation of the probability of a loss. Furthermore, reporting aggregated returns might lead investors to evaluate the aggregated outcome relative to a different reference point (the overall portfolio instead of the amount invested in risky assets), which makes them less likely to experience a loss and therefore increases the willingness to invest in the risky asset. Thus, aggregating information seems to reduce mental accounting, namely having one account for risky and one account for risk-free investments. Ex post, our findings show that the portfolio group also makes consistent subsequent allocation decisions and shows a lower dissatisfaction with outcomes in the loss domain. The results were consistent across both experiments despite the use of different subject pools and investment amounts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: While a key proposition is that a sustainable path is one where wealth does not decline, whether losses in natural capital can be compensated in wellbeing terms by more produced, social or natural capital remains an area of controversy. In this paper, we seek to better understand preferences for different combinations of assets that comprise (part of) the asset portfolio of a nation. In a study of coastal and marine natural assets, we test for the existence of weak or strong sustainability preferences using different compensation options (respectively produced capital and natural capital) offered to a sample of the public in Spain in the case of possible future oil spills. As a further element of this test, we provide an empirical reflection on Aldred (2002, 2006) and Turner (2007) who speculate that individuals may not view money as compensating for certain environmental losses whereas investments in social assets may offer a more acceptable compensation option. Our results do appear to circumscribe in some way the acceptability of investing in produced capital and reveal a tendency towards a preference for social capital compensation. Nevertheless, the size of the oil spill and the environmental beliefs of respondents also influence choices over the natural capital compensation option. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Lakshminarayanan et al. (J Exp Soc Psychol 47: 689-693, 2011) showed that when choice is between variable (risky) and fixed (safe) food amounts with the same expected values, capuchins prefer the safe alternative if choice is framed as a gain, but the risky alternative if it is framed as a loss. These results seem similar to those seen in human prospect-theory tests in choice between variable and fixed gains or losses. Based on this similarity, they interpreted their results as identifying a between-species commonality in cognitive function. In this report, we repeat their experiment with humans as subjects (an up-linkage replication). Whether choices were rewarded with candy or nickels, choice approximated indifference whether framed as gains or losses. Our data mirror those of others who found that when humans make risky choices within a repeated-trials procedure without verbal instruction about outcome likelihoods, preference biases seen in one-shot, language-guided, prospect-theory tests such as Tversky and Kahneman's (Science 211:453-458, 1981) reflection effect may not appear.

      "Abstract: Objective The impact of migraines on patients is commonly divided between the level of impairment associated with headache symptoms (headache phase) and the quality-of-life effects immediately following the headache (post-headache phase). Evaluations of migraineurs' productivity losses and health-related quality of life have provided an understanding of the burden associated with the headache and post-headache symptoms, but do not quantify the relative importance of each phase from a patient perspective. In this study, we evaluated migraineurs' willingness to accept trade-offs among symptom severity in the headache and post-headache phases, symptom duration in the headache and post-headache phases, and symptom-free time within a general-preference theoretic framework. Methods We administered a choice-format, conjoint-analysis survey, also called a discrete-choice experiment, to a sample of migraineurs from a nationally representative online consumer panel. After inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 510 eligible subjects completed the survey. The survey elicited choices between pairs of migraine profiles describing symptom durations and symptom-free time for the headache and post-headache phase. Results Migraineurs in our study were strongly affected by the pain associated with the headache phase. However, experiencing difficulty with daily social and family activities in the post-headache phase also had a statistically significant impact on migraineurs' perceived level of well-being. Migraineurs reported that hypothetical treatments that limited the duration of headache symptoms without allowing them to resume their daily activities for 16 hours after a headache, on average, were less than half as good as treatments that limited both headache and post-headache symptoms. Conclusion Our results suggest that treatments that relieve and shorten symptoms during the post-headache phase can offer significant benefits to migraineurs. © 2013 American Headache Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this study, violation-producing conditions from an organizational and individual point of view are investigated. In concrete terms, framing effects of production outcome displays in relation to production goals, the risk of a technical accident, as well as person-related variables and their impact on violations are investigated based on the theoretical assumptions of prospect theory and risk-taking. It is assumed that violations are more likely when performance is below the aspiration level associated with an anticipated loss. A 2 × 3 factorial experimental design (n = 118) was selected in accordance with the Asian Disease decision scenario in the form of a computer-simulated task environment Simulation Waste Water Treatment. Participants acted out the role of a production supervisor running a plant. Experimental conditions were (1) the framing of individual performance outcomes in relation to the production goals in terms of losses or gains, and (2) the risk (20, 35, and 5%) with which an accident (a deflagration) might occur through using a corner-cutting procedure. A significant main effect of the framing conditions and no effect of risk conditions or interaction effect emerged. An additional path analysis shows the influence of risky decision-making and acquired skills in terms of knowledge of the safety-related procedure on a violation. In summary, violations are strongly affected by (a) framing effects of production outcomes when the performance is below the aspiration level and (b) person-related variables, in particular risky decision-making and skill. Results strongly emphasize that we found violation-producing conditions over and above what has so far been proposed and give rise to our claim that communicating production outcomes as gains and the increase of skill increases the likelihood of compliance with safety-related procedures. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Elvik (2006) discussed the appropriateness of including the benefits that offenders get when violating traffic laws. While concluding that these benefits could not be given standing, Elvik resorted to argumentation from normative theories outside the schools of economic theory. In this article, we present arguments for omitting violators' benefits, or lost benefits, based on normative stands within economics school of thought. By means of two examples, we illustrate the distinction between a project of increased/improved enforcement of existing speed limits, where violators' time losses should not be included - compatible with Elvik's point of view - and a project of reduced speed limits, where the time loss should be included. This clarification of standing in cost-benefit analysis of road safety measures is based on the economics school of thought, where cost-benefit analysis is regarded as a decision tool operating within social constraints and where speed limits are considered as absolute institutions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

We illustrate the approach using the decision making plane, which explicitly incorporates opportunity costs and relaxes the assumptions of perfect divisibility and constant returns to scale of the cost-effectiveness plane. The nature of the bad (or good) outcome is determined by the quadrant that it falls into (i.e., a 'quadrant effect') and its magnitude by its location within the quadrant (i.e., 'within quadrant effect'). By explicitly defining the loss function, the process of accepting (or rejecting) a new program becomes transparent. We illustrate the approach using a loss function and a net gain function. We show that by recognizing that, not all bad (or good) outcomes are equal and the choice of a loss or a net gain function can result in different ranking of resource allocation options. Further implications of the proposed approach are discussed. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Neural encoding of value-based stimuli is suggested to involve representations of summary statistics, including risk and expected value (EV). A more complex, but ecologically more common, context is when multiple risky options are evaluated together. However, it is unknown whether encoding related to option evaluation in these situations involves similar principles. Here we employed fMRI during a task that parametrically manipulated EV and risk in two simultaneously presented lotteries, both of which contained either gains or losses. We found representations of EV in medial prefrontal cortex and anterior insula, an encoding that was dependent on which option was chosen (i.e. chosen and unchosen EV) and whether the choice was over gains or losses. Parietal activity reflected whether the riskier or surer option was selected, whilst activity in a network of regions that also included parietal cortex reflected both combined risk and difference in risk for the two options. Our findings provide support for the idea that summary statistics underpin a representation of value-based stimuli, and further that these summary statistics undergo distinct forms of encoding. © 2013 The Authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Adversarial decision making is aimed at determining optimal decision strategies to deal with an adaptive opponent. A clear example of such situation is the repeated imitation game presented here. Two agents compete in an adversarial model where one agent wants to learn how to imitate the actions taken by the other agent by means of the observation and memorization of the past actions. One defense against this adversary is to make decisions that are intended to confuse him. To achieve this, randomized strategies that change along time for one of the agents are proposed and their performance is analysed from both a theoretical and empirical point of view. We also study the ability of the imitator to avoid deception and adapt to a new behaviour by forgetting the oldest observations. The results confirm that wrong assumptions about the imitator's behaviour lead to dramatic losses due to a failure in causing deception. © 2012 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction: Unmedicated Parkinson's disease patients tend to be risk-averse while dopaminergic treatment causes a tendency to take risks. While dopamine agonists may result in clinically apparent impulse control disorders, treatment with levodopa also causes shift in behaviour associated with an enhanced response to rewards. Two important determinants in decision-making are how subjects perceive the magnitude and probability of outcomes. Our objective was to determine if patients with Parkinson's disease on or off levodopa showed differences in their perception of value when making decisions under risk. Methods: The Vancouver Gambling task presents subjects with a choice between one prospect with larger outcome and a second with higher probability. Eighteen age-matched controls and eighteen patients with Parkinson's disease before and after levodopa were tested. In the Gain Phase subjects chose between one prospect with higher probability and another with larger reward to maximize their gains. In the Loss Phase, subjects played to minimize their losses. Results: Patients with Parkinson's disease, on or off levodopa, were similar to controls when evaluating gains. However, in the Loss Phase before levodopa, they were more likely to avoid the prospect with lower probability but larger loss, as indicated by the steeper slope of their group psychometric function (t(24)=2.21, p=0.04). Modelling with prospect theory suggested that this was attributable to a 28% overestimation of the magnitude of loss, rather than an altered perception of its probability. Conclusion: While pre-medicated patients with Parkinson's disease show risk-aversion for large losses, patients on levodopa have normal perception of magnitude and probability for both loss and gain. The finding of accurate and normally biased decisions under risk in medicated patients with PD is important because it indicates that, if there is indeed anomalous risk-seeking behaviour in such a cohort, it may derive from abnormalities in components of decision making that are separate from evaluations of size and probability. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: Substance-dependent individuals make poor decisions on the Iowa Gambling Task, a reward-related decisionmaking task that involves risk and uncertainty. Task performance depends on several factors, including how sensitive individuals are to feedback and how well they learn based on such feedback. A physiological signal that guides decision making based on feedback is prediction error. The authors investigated whether disruptions in the neural systems underlying prediction error processing in substance-dependent individuals could account for decision-making performance on a modified Iowa Gambling Task. Methods: Thirty-two substance-dependent individuals and 30 healthy comparison subjects played a modified version of the Iowa Gambling Task during MR scanning. Trial-totrial behavior and functional MRI (fMRI) blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal were analyzed using a computational model of prediction error based on internal expectancies. The authors investigated how well BOLD signal tracked prediction error in the striatum and the orbitofrontal cortex as well as over the whole brain in patients relative to comparison subjects. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, substance-dependent patients were less sensitive to loss compared with gain, made less consistent choices, and performed worse on the modified Iowa Gambling Task. The ventral striatum and medial orbitofrontal cortex did not track prediction error as strongly in patients as in healthy subjects. Conclusions: Weaker tracking of prediction error in substance-dependent relative to healthy individuals suggests that altered frontal-striatal error learning signals may underlie decision-making impairments in drug abusers. Computational fMRI may help bridge the knowledge gap between physiology and behavior to informresearch aimed at substance abuse treatment.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One of the main goals of terrorism is to instill fear in a targeted populace. We investigate how information precision about rare, but highly devastating terrorist attacks influences psychological resilience, which we operationalize as the ability to continue to take optimum risks. First, we develop a mathematical model of a citizen's resilience in the face of a terrorist threat. We then test the model in a laboratory experiment in which individuals face a choice between lotteries that offer higher payoffs but have a small probability of a large negative loss and a safe option. In the experiment, we vary the nature of warnings about the lotteries to see how vague warnings vs precise information influence optimal risk-taking (resilience). We find that precise information increases subjects' willingness to take risks. Warnings containing no information do not influence subjects' willingness to accept risk, but can influence resilience through affecting which risks subjects take. © The Author(s) 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risky decision making, a hallmark phenotype of substance use disorders (SUD), is thought to be associated with deficient feedback processing. Whether these aberrations are present prior to SUD onset or reflect merely a consequence of chronic substance use on the brain remains unclear. The present study investigated whether blunted feedback processing during risky decision making reflects a biological predisposition to SUD. We assessed event-related potentials elicited by positive and negative feedback during performance of a modified version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) among high-risk adolescents with a parental history of SUD (HR; n = 61) and normal-risk controls (NR; n = 91). HR males made significantly more risky and faster decisions during the BART than did NR controls. Moreover, HR adolescents showed significantly reduced P300 amplitudes in response to both positive and negative feedback as compared to NR controls. These differences were not secondary to prolonged substance use exposure. Results are discussed in terms of feedback-specific processes. Reduced P300 amplitudes in the BART may reflect poor processing of feedback at the level of overall salience, which may keep people from effectively predicting the probability of future gains and losses. Though conclusions are tentative, blunted feedback processing during risky decision making may represent a promising endophenotypic vulnerability marker for SUD. © Cambridge University Press 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, in reality, there may be an opportunity to backlog the lost sales, by offering some incentive for waiting. Further, not all the customers that could not buy in the first instant may avail the rebate offer and buy. The retailer's decision includes selling price, order quantity and the rebate that will maximize its expected profit. The back log fill rate is modelled as a function of the proportion of rebate relative to the price.

      "Abstract: Risk in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is often understood in terms of intertemporal choices, i.e., preference for immediate outcomes in favor of delayed outcomes is considered risky decision making. According to behavioral economics, healthy decision makers are expected to refrain from choosing the short-sighted immediate gain because, over time (10 trials of the IGT), the immediate gains result in a long term loss (net loss). Instead decision makers are expected to maximize their gains by choosing options that, over time (10 trials), result in delayed or long term gains (net gain). However, task choices are sometimes made on the basis of the frequency of reward and punishment such that frequent rewards/infrequent punishments are favored over infrequent rewards/frequent punishments. The presence of these two attributes (intertemporality and frequency of reward) in IGT decision making may correspond to the emotion-cognition dichotomy and reflect a dual conception of risk. Decision making on the basis of the two attributes was tested under two conditions: delay in retest and sleep deprivation. An interaction between sleep deprivation and time delay was expected to attenuate the difference between the two attributes. Participants were 40 male university students. Analysis of the effects of IGT attribute type (intertemporal vs. frequency of reinforcement), sleep deprivation (sleep deprivation vs. no sleep deprivation), and test-retest gap (short vs. long delay) showed a significant within-subjects effect of IGT attribute type thus confirming the difference between the two attributes. Sleep deprivation had no effect on the attributes, but test-retest gap and the three-way interaction between attribute type, test-retest gap, and sleep deprivation were significantly different. Post-hoc tests revealed that sleep deprivation and short test-retest gap attenuated the difference between the two attributes. Furthermore, the results showed an expected trend of increase in intertemporal decision making at retest suggesting that intertemporal decision making benefited from repeated task exposure. The present findings add to understanding of the emotion-cognition dichotomy. Further, they show an important time-dependent effect of a universally experienced constraint (sleep deprivation) on decision making. It is concluded that risky decision making in the IGT is contingent on the attribute under consideration and is affected by factors such as time elapsed and constraint experienced before the retest. © 2013 Singh.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The integration of business processes across multiple companies can provide economic benefits, thus ensuring the sustainability of the involved companies. However these advantages are accompanied by many potential risks. For instance, emerging disruptions within a supply chain can spread over several partners resulting in economic losses. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the development of a collaborative cross-supply chain framework that reduces the extent of loss after the occurrence of unforeseen damaging events in sensitive logistics nodes. Design/methodology/approach: To handle the impacts of unforeseen damaging events in sensitive logistics nodes, the focus of our approach lies on the implementation of a collaboratively applicable concept for sensitive logistics nodes that supports a rapid collaborative decision-making among the partners. Therefore, different damaging events as well as the logistics and transport processes in freight villages are determined and implemented in an agent-based simulation model. Findings: Multi-agent simulation can be used for a scenario-based collaborative risk management in sensitive logistics nodes. By executing simulation experiments the impacts of selected damaging events can be analysed and used for the development of scenario specific strategies for the partners in sensitive logistics nodes with the objective to maintain the flow of goods after disturbances. Practical implications: The paper proposes a multi-agent simulation, which can be used collaboratively in a cross-supply chain team to support decision-making processes in sensitive logistics nodes after a disruption has occurred. To get an effective and efficient tool, involved companies are included into the development and implementation processes. Originality/value: The value of this paper lies in the approach of a multi-agent based simulation system that supports a collaborative risk management across different companies and different supply chains in sensitive logistics nodes. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Models of human behavior in the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) have played a pivotal role in accounting for behavioral differences during decision-making. One critical difference between models that have been used to account for behavior in the IGT is the inclusion or exclusion of the assumption that participants tend to persevere, or stay with the same option over consecutive trials. Models that allow for this assumption include win-stay-lose-shift (WSLS) models and reinforcement learning (RL) models that include a decay learning rule where expected values for each option decay as they are chosen less often. One shortcoming of RL models that have included decay rules is that the tendency to persevere by sticking with the same option has been conflated with the tendency to select the option with the highest expected value because a single term is used to represent both of these tendencies. In the current work we isolate the tendencies to perseverate and to select the option with the highest expected value by including them as separate terms in a Value-Plus-Perseveration (VPP) RL model. Overall the VPP model provides a better fit to data from a large group of participants than models that include a single term to account for both perseveration and the representation of expected value. Simulations of each model show that the VPP model's simulated choices most closely resemble the decision-making behavior of human subjects. In addition, we also find that parameter estimates of loss aversion are more strongly correlated with performance when perseverative tendencies and expected value representations are decomposed as separate terms within the model. The results suggest that the tendency to persevere and the tendency to select the option that leads to the best net payoffare central components of decision-making behavior in the IGT. Future work should use this model to better examine decision-making behavior. © 2013 Worthy, Pang and Byrne.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: PLINIVS Study Centre of University of Naples Federico II has developed a methodology that aims to estimate, in probabilistic terms, the direct and the indirect economic impacts of a Sub-Plinian I or Strombolian type eruption of Vesuvius. The economic model has been implemented as a complementary tool of the Volcanic Impact Simulation Model, a tool developed at PLINIVS Center available to the Italian Civil Protection Department (DPC) decision makers to quantify the potential losses consequent to a possible eruption of Vesuvius or Campi Flegrei. Along the expected time history of the eruptive event all the possible \"direct costs\" and the \"factors\" (indirect costs) impacting the economic growth in the event area have been identified. Each cost factor is built up through a specific algorithm that is fed by various providers, in order to run software that will estimate the global amount of economic damage from a volcanic event. The model does not include the economic evaluation of intangibles (e.g. human casualties), while the evaluation of damage to the local cultural heritage (historical buildings, archeological sites, monuments, etc.), is linked to the economic impact on tourism, estimated into indirect costs. The architecture of the model is based on a simulation logic, which allows an evaluation of different economic impact scenarios through input changes, allowing the model to be used as a tool to support the decision making process.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background:Decisions under risk and with outcomes that are delayed in time are ubiquitous in real life and can have a significant impact on the health and wealth of the decision-maker. Despite its potential relevance for real-world choices, the degree of aberrant risky and intertemporal decision-making in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has received little attention to date.Method:We used a case-control design to compare decision-making in healthy control subjects (N=16) versus untreated depressed subjects in a current major depressive episode (N=20). In order to examine how major depressive disorder (MDD) may impact decision-making, subjects made decisions over (1) risky outcomes and (2) delayed outcomes in the domain of gains and losses using choice paradigms from neuroeconomics. In a pre-planned analysis, depressed subjects were subdivided into those with primary PTSD along with comorbid MDD (MDD+PTSD) versus those with primary MDD without PTSD (MDD-only). Choice behavior was modeled via a standard econometric model of intertemporal choice, a quasi-hyperbolic temporal discounting function, which was estimated for each subject group separately.Results:Under conditions of potential gain, depressed subjects demonstrated greater discounting for gains across all time frames compared to controls. In the realm of losses, both subgroups of depressed subjects discounted more steeply than controls for short time frames. However, for delayed losses ranging from >1-10 years, MDD+PTSD subjects showed shallower discounting rates relative to MDD-only subjects, who continued to discount future losses steeply. Risk attitudes did not contribute to differences in intertemporal choice.Conclusions:Depressed patients make choices that minimize current pain and maximize current reward, despite severe later consequences or lost opportunities. Anxiety associated with PTSD may serve as a partially protective factor in decision-making about long-term potential losses compared to MDD patients without PTSD. © 2013 Engelmann et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It has long been known that human cognitive function improves through young adulthood and then declines across the later life span. Here we examined how decision-making function changes across the life span by measuring risk and ambiguity attitudes in the gain and loss domains, as well as choice consistency, in an urban cohort ranging in age from 12 to 90 y. We identified several important age-related patterns in decision making under uncertainty: First, we found that healthy elders between the ages of 65 and 90 were strikingly inconsistent in their choices compared with younger subjects. Just as elders show profound declines in cognitive function, they also show profound declines in choice rationality compared with their younger peers. Second, we found that the widely documented phenomenon of ambiguity aversion is specific to the gain domain and does not occur in the loss domain, except for a slight effect in older adults. Finally, extending an earlier report by our group, we found that risk attitudes across the life span show an inverted U-shaped function; both elders and adolescents are more risk-averse than their midlife counterparts. Taken together, these characterizations of decision-making function across the life span in this urban cohort strengthen the conclusions of previous reports suggesting a profound impact of aging on cognitive function in this domain.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study investigates the relationship between three different cognitive processes underlying the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and adolescent smoking behaviors in a longitudinal study. We conducted a longitudinal study of 181 Chinese adolescents in Chengdu City, China. The participants were followed from 10th to 11th grade. When they were in the 10th grade (Time 1), we tested these adolescents' decision-making using the IGT and working memory capacity using the Self-ordered Pointing Test (SOPT). Self-report questionnaires were used to assess school academic performance and smoking behaviors. The same questionnaires were completed again at the 1-year follow-up (Time 2). The Expectancy-Valence (EV) Model was applied to distill the IGT performance into three different underlying psychological components: (i) a motivational component which indicates the subjective weight the adolescents assign to gains vs. losses; (ii) a learning-rate component which indicates the sensitivity to recent outcomes vs. past experiences; and (iii) a response component which indicates how consistent the adolescents are between learning and responding. The subjective weight to gains vs. losses at Time 1 significantly predicted current smokers and current smoking levels at Time 2, controlling for demographic variables and baseline smoking behaviors. Therefore, by decomposing the IGT into three different psychological components, we found that the motivational process of weight gain vs. losses may serve as a neuropsychological marker to predict adolescent smoking behaviors in a general youth population. © 2013 Xiao, Koritzky, Johnson and Bechara.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent studies have shown that acute stress can lead to riskier decision making. Yet, the underlying mechanisms of the stress effects on decisions under risk remain poorly understood. To gain a better understanding of decision-making processes and potential strategy application under stress, we investigated decision making in pure gain and loss domains with unequal expected values (EVs) across alternatives. We conducted an experimental study with a 2 × 2 design (stress vs. no stress and gain domain vs. loss domain). The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was utilized to induce acute stress. Controls performed the placebo-TSST (p-TSST). To validate the stress response we measured salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase concentrations. We used a modified version of the Game of Dice Task (GDT) to assess decision-making performance in a gain and a loss domain. Results showed that non-stressed participants made less risky decisions in the gain domain compared to those of the loss domain. This behavior is in accordance with previous studies and indicates the stability of the framing effect in even more complex tasks with changing EVs across alternatives. Stress did not alter risk taking behavior in the gain domain. Yet, in the loss domain stressed participants made less risky decisions compared to controls. Additionally, the data support earlier findings of longer reaction times in loss compared to gain domains due to higher cognitive effort for loss-framed decisions. It is discussed that stress may lead to reduced amygdala activation, which has been found to reduce riskier decisions in a loss domain. With respect to earlier results of riskier decisions in tasks that unite both gain and loss domains, it is discussed whether stress leads to a stronger evaluation of high gains and a neglect of losses. © 2013 Pabst, Brand and Wolf.\u001b[0m :\n",

The multinomial logit model was used to estimate the parameters and the likelihood of the level of confidence differing among the 3 groups of respondents in this study.

This study tested the hypothesis that because time is characterized by perishability, fi xed supply, and infungibility, people with strong motivation to obtain a long period of uninterrupted discretionary time would strive to trim the time needed for non-discretionary activities or to combine several non-discretionary activities. As a result, people prefer integration over segregation of multiple time losses or gains, which is not consistent with the prediction based on hedonic editing theory or the renewable resource model.

      "Abstract: Flood insurance plays an important role in climate adaptation by recovering insured losses in the event of catastrophic flooding. Voluntary adoption of flood insurance has been seen as a function of risk perception that is shaped by social norms. This paper attempts to clarify the relationship between these factors. It is based on a household survey conducted in the eastern cities of Australia and involving a total of 501 randomly selected residents. Results of a path analysis show that the likelihood of having flood insurance cover was associated with perceived social norms, but not perceived flood risk. In addition, perceived norms and risk were statistically related to each other. It is concluded that social norms played a mediating role between insuring decision and risk perception. Risk perception might influence the insuring decision indirectly through shaping perception of social norms. This implies that adaptive behaviour is not necessarily a function of risk perception, but an outcome of its impacts upon the ways in which the individuals situate themselves in their social circles or the society. There is a feedback process in which individual perceptions of risk manifest as both a cause and effect, shaping and being shaped by the socio-cultural context. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

The authors assume that implicit processes operate in the endowment effect and propose an explanation that is derived from the two main accounts of the effect, ownership and loss aversion. Based on the implicit egotism and selfaffirmation literatures, the model argues that selling is perceived as an implicit selfthreat and that sellers, as a part of their automatic defense mechanism, respond to this self-threat by enhancing the value of the self-associated object. Five studies test these conjectures and provide support for the proposed model. © 2013 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We use data on insurance deductible choices to estimate a structural model of risky choice that incorporates \"standard\" risk aversion (diminishing marginal utility for wealth) and probability distortions. We find that probability distortions - characterized by substantial overweighting of small probabilities and only mild insensitivity to probability changes - play an important role in explaining the aversion to risk manifested in deductible choices. This finding is robust to allowing for observed and unobserved heterogeneity in preferences. We demonstrate that neither Koszegi-Rabin loss aversion alone nor Gul disappointment aversion alone can explain our estimated probability distortions, signifying a key role for probability weighting.\u001b[0m :\n",

Our main finding suggests that when the proportion of traded lemons is high (low), the problem of market failure is mitigated (enhanced). In addition, for the case of Cumulative Prospect Theory, we show that (a) the higher the loss aversion is, the more pronounced is the market failure; (b) gain-domain elevation is negatively related to the extent of market failure; and (c) the value function is (i) negatively monotonic in the gain-domain diminishing sensitivity parameter when the market is characterized by a high proportion of \"peaches,\" and (ii) positively monotonic in the loss-domain diminishing sensitivity parameter when the market is characterized by a high proportion of \"lemons.\" © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A fundamental assumption of prospect theory is gain-loss separability (GLS)-the assertion that the overall utility of a prospect can be expressed as a function of the utilities of its positive and negative components. Violations of GLS may potentially limit the generalization of results from studies of single-domain prospects to mixed prospects and systematically distort the predictions of the theory. Violations also have implications for how choices with positive and negative components should be presented to decision makers. Previous studies, using different elicitation methods, have documented different rates, and types, of systematic violations of GLS. We discuss the differences between two specific elicitation methods-binary choice and certainty equivalents-and report results of a new study of GLS using both methods and randomly generated prospects. We compare the extent and nature of GLS violations under the two elicitation methods using between-subject and within-subject analyses. We find (i) systematic violations of GLS under both methods, (ii) higher rates of violations under choice, (iii) higher sensitivity to the outcomes for the certainty equivalents, which is consistent with the predictions of the scale-compatibility hypothesis, and (iv) different patterns of violations under the two methods, which are explained by method-specific preferences. We discuss the psychological mechanisms underlying the findings and the implications for presenting information with gain and loss components. Copyright © 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

In two experiments we find that time pressure has no effect on risk attitudes for gains, but increases risk aversion for losses. For mixed prospects, subjects become simultaneously more loss averse and more gain seeking under time pressure, depending on the framing of the prospects. The results suggest the importance of aspiration levels, and thus the overall probability to break even, under time pressure.

      "Abstract: Around 75% of active ingredients (a.i.) used as plant protection products in Europe before 1993 have been withdrawn from the market since the introduction of Directive 91/414/EEC, concerning the placing on the market of plant protection products. Although a large number of pesticides have been lost, some were replaced by 'better', 'less toxic' or less persistent molecules, because industry did not want to continue to support outdated molecules and spend money on all the extra tests required. However, in reducing the number there should have been a careful assessment of whether any should be retained to allow better resistance management strategies to be maintained. The approval process for agricultural pesticides that can be used in agriculture is a continuous one and we can expect additional important a.i. to be withdrawn, as has been seen with the EC decision in April 2013, to ban three neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) for two years. The EU Pesticide Reduction Strategy responds to public concern and medical evidence about the harmful effects of pesticides on human health. While most people would agree that we should try to minimise the use of conventional pesticides in our environment, there is considerable controversy over where the balance should be struck, between risk and benefit. The debate is highly polarised, between those who think the risk of harm from pesticides is already being managed by strict regulation of their use and, those who think that a precautionary approach should be adopted and that potential hazard is a reasonable criterion for removal. The agricultural industry, including most farmers, argue that further pesticide removals will result in significant decreases in European food production and, therefore, higher food prices. Environmental and other campaigning organizations such as Friends of the Earth, the Soil Association and The Pesticide Action Network, believe that the rate of removal of the most 'hazardous' pesticides should be increased and that there should be much less use of 'derogations'. © 2013 Research Information Ltd.

      "Abstract: One of the objectives of energy security is the uninterrupted physical availability of energy. However, there is limited information about how much is the cost of energy supply interruptions. This information is essential to optimize investment and operating decisions to prevent energy shortages, or, alternatively, to determine the strength of the signals to be sent to the agents so that they may invest accordingly. In this paper, we estimate the economic impact of an electricity interruption in different sectors and regions of Spain. Although there are several caveats in our analysis, we find that in 2008 the cost for the Spanish economy of one kWh of electricity not supplied was above €4 even in a conservative scenario, which is higher than the signals currently being sent as incentives to avoid these interruptions. This might result in an underinvestment in short-term energy security, particularly when we add the usual risk aversion of most consumers. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Firms' tax planning decisions, similar to their other operational decisions, are made in a competitive environment. Various stakeholders observe the tax payments and evaluate these against the relevant peer group. This implies firms might not simply minimise their tax burden, but also consider their competitors behaviour when deciding about tax planning. Empirically this creates interdependencies in the tax planning activities of firms. Introducing the concept of a reputational loss we show the positive interdependence in a theoretical model and test it in a spatial econometric model. Empirical evidence suggests that benchmarking takes place both within countries and within industries, however for the latter it is important to include firms in large non-EU OECD countries. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The use of behavioural economics to inform policy has over recent years been captured by those who advocate nudge interventions. Nudge is a non-regulatory approach that attempts to motivate individual behaviour change through subtle alterations in the choice environments that people face. It is argued in this article that government interventions ought to be more overt than that traditionally advocated by nudge adherents, and that governments should principally attempt to influence behaviour if the acts of those targeted are causing harm to others. With this in mind, governments can use the findings of behavioural economics, including present bias and loss aversion, to inform where and how to regulate directly against undesirable private sector activities. This behavioural economic-informed method of regulation is hereby termed budge, to indicate that, rather than nudging citizens, behavioural economics might be used more appropriately in the public sector to help inform regulation that budges harmful private sector activities. © Cambridge University Press 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: International agreements on plant health and trade require that regulating a pest should be justified by economic impact assessment. Economic impact assessments are usually qualitative, weakening the objective and transparency of the regulation decision. This study assessed the potential economic impacts of the invasion of the plant pathogenic bacterium 'Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum' into the European Union in order to economically justify a decision on its quarantine status. Direct economic impacts resulting from yield loss in potato and tomato were computed using partial budgeting at a regional scale, while total economic impacts on the potato and tomato markets were computed using partial equilibrium modelling at the EU scale. Annual direct impacts at the most likely infestation level were estimated at €222 m for the whole EU. Uncertainty analysis showed a distribution of foreseeable annual impacts with a 5th percentile of €192 m, and a 95th percentile of €512 m. Increased market prices of potato and tomato resulting from reduced supply were found to increase profits for non-infested producers and to compensate in part for the production losses of infested producers, with consumers paying for this mitigation of impacts on producers. The expected negative impact on societal welfare at the most likely infestation level is less than the estimated direct impacts, viz. €114 m/year. The potential economic impacts of 'Ca. L. solanacearum' in the European Union are demonstrably of major importance. Therefore, a decision to categorize this organism as a quarantine pest is supported. © 2013 British Society for Plant Pathology.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this study, we designed a continuous wins-and-losses task to monitor the mental activities during decision-making and their effects on subsequent decisions in Internet addiction disorder (IAD) subjects. In behavioral performance, IAD subjects show longer response time, lower repeat rate and greater Stroop effect than healthy controls. In neuroimaging results, IAD subjects show increased brain activities in the inferior frontal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex and decreased activation in the caudate and posterior cingulate cortex after continuous wins than healthy controls. In addition, IAD subjects show increased brain activities in the inferior frontal gyrus and decreased brain activation in the posterior cingulate cortex after continuous losses. Thus, we concluded that IAD subjects engage more cognitive activities to finish the decision-making task. As a result, they cannot sufficiently focus on the executive function during this process. They also do not pay adequate attention to considering previous selections and relevant outcomes during decision-making. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background. Undescended testis (UDT) or cryptorchidism is the most common genital anomaly seen in boys and can be treated surgically by orchidopexy. The age at which orchidopexy should be performed is controversial for both congenital and acquired UDT. Methods. A decision analysis is performed in which all available knowledge is combined to assess the outcomes of orchidopexy at different ages. Results. Without surgery, unilateral congenital UDT and bilateral congenital UDT are associated with average losses in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 1.53 QALYs (3% discounting 0.66 QALYs) and 5.23 QALYs (1.91 QALYs), respectively. Surgery reduces this QALY loss to on average 0.84 QALYs (0.21 QALYs) for unilateral UDT and 1.66 QALYs (0.40 QALYs) for bilateral UDT. Surgery at detection will lead to the lowest QALY loss of 0.91 (0.34) and 1.73 (0.60) QALYs, respectively, for unilateral and bilateral acquired UDT compared with surgery during puberty and no surgery. No sensitivity analysis is able to change the preferences for these strategies. Conclusions. Based on our decision analytic model using societal valuations of health outcomes, surgery for unilateral UDT (both congenital and acquired) yielded the lowest loss in QALYs. Given the modest differences in outcomes, there is room for patient (or parent) preference with respect to the performance and timing of surgery in case of unilateral UDT. For bilateral UDT (both congenital and acquired), orchidopexy at any age provides considerable benefit, in particular through improved fertility. As there is no strong effect of timing, the age at which orchidopexy is performed should be discussed with the parents and the patient. More clinical evidence on issues related to timing may in the future modify these results and hence this advice. © The Author(s) 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this chapter, we demonstrate that studying relevant investment information helps reduce individual investors' disposition effect. It is prevalent that many individual investors in stock market do not form their own opinion about the investments; instead they mimic investment strategies of others. This research shows that the intention of making easy money only worsens the disposition effect. We collect 2,632 individual stock investors through nationwide surveys in Taiwan. Using regression models, we examine the effects of study on reducing investors' inclination of holding-losers/selling-winners and the disposition effect. The findings show that investors realize losses sooner and significantly reduce the disposition effect if they choose to learn about their investments. The results also demonstrate that if the investors are willing to learn about firms in which they invest, they become more rational about their investment decisions. They are no longer influenced by the sentiment of regret resistance or misperception of the stock trend, which in turn reduces the disposition effect. This study supports that investors make better investment decisions if they perform necessary due diligence prior to investing. Copyright © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent studies have identified several factors, such as negative affect or fairness concerns, that contribute to explaining the seemingly irrational behavior of receivers in the ultimatum game, namely rejecting unfair offers despite the corresponding personal loss. The opposite behavior, accepting offers, has often been attributed to rational decision-making, as predicted by rational choice theory. Based on this assumption, we investigated long reaction times as a behavioral variable and need for cognition as an individual differences variable as indicators of thoughtful and rational decision-making. To our surprise, we found both reaction times and need for cognition to predict rejection, rather than acceptance of unfair offers. Our results challenge the interpretation of acceptance vs. rejection in terms of rational vs. emotional accounts. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The loss of homes to wildfires is an important issue in the USA and other countries. Yet many homeowners living in fire-prone areas do not undertake mitigating actions, such as clearing vegetation, to decrease the risk of losing their home. To better understand the complexity of wildfire risk-mitigation decisions and the role of perceived risk, we conducted a survey of homeowners in a fire-prone area of the front range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. We examine the relationship between perceived wildfire risk ratings and risk-mitigating behaviours in two ways. First, we model wildfire risk-mitigation behaviours as a function of perceived risk. Then, we model wildfire risk-mitigation behaviours and perceived risk simultaneously. The results of the simultaneous model suggest that perceived risk and wildfire risk-mitigating behaviours are jointly determined. By correctly specifying the relationship between risk perceptions and mitigating behaviours, we are better able to understand the relationship between other factors, such as exposure to a wildfire-mitigation program and wildfire risk-mitigating behaviours. We also find that having a wood roof, as well as homeowner age, income and previous experience with living in a fire-prone area, are associated with wildfire risk-mitigating behaviours. © 2013 IAWF.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: This research has been carried out to look into the long run impact of the controls on capital inflows imposed during the years 1998-2001 in Malaysia. The paper intends to capture the long-term impact of capital controls in changing the composition of capital flows into Malaysia and to examine whether the controls have been able to divert the short-term capital inflows to longer-term investments. Design/methodology/approach: The autoregressive first differenced ordinary least square models have been used to examine whether the controls have been able to divert the short-term capital inflows to longer-term investments. Findings: The capital controls have been successful in the short run in switching some of the short-term capital inflows into longer-term portfolio investments, without jeopardizing the Malaysian investment environment in the longer-term. Such controls did not have an impact on the decisions of foreign investors in the long run even if the rating agencies downgraded the Malaysian investments immediately after the controls were imposed. This paper suggests that capital flows into Malaysia were more a result of interest rate differentials between the domestic and the US interest rates and hardly depended on the Malaysian risk adjusted returns. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of this research is the ephemeral nature of the econometric analysis. All the variables, except government spending, are first differenced, in order to overcome the problem of spurious regression. However, while taking the first difference, there is a possibility of losing valuable long-term relationship between the capital flows and the explanatory variables. Further, the analysis was carried out without much reference to the derivative market, which might have disguised some of the capital flows. Social implications: Capital controls are adopted to prevent the volatility in domestic markets caused due to capital flight. The capital flight has huge macroeconomic implications on a society, including unemployment, interest rate volatility and subsequent economic slowdown and recession. If adopted with an intention to provide a temporary breathing space, it might help the countries manage their domestic imbalances. Originality/value: This paper provides a fresh look at the implications of capital controls with longer-term data that also include the period after the controls were withdrawn. The study is expected to be independent of market distortions, which might arise with narrow time frames that cover periods during and/or immediately after the crisis. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

Employing different negotiation scenarios, three lab experiments tested the prediction that prevention-oriented buyers would thus display higher negotiation aversion than promotion-oriented buyers. Results showed that prevention-oriented people in the role of a potential buyer were willing to accept lower monetary compensation to refrain from entering the negotiation and were more likely to exit the negotiation when such an opportunity was presented to them.

      "Abstract: We hypothesized that framing possible outcomes of decisions in terms of gains vs. losses should increase the salience of information that is incongruent in valence (counter-regulation principle: gain frame - negativity bias, loss frame - positivity bias). These incongruent attentional biases in the processing of positive and negative outcomes of risky options can explain why people tend to avoid risky options in a gain frame but tend to choose risky options in a loss frame. In line with our expectations, Experiment 1 revealed incongruent effects of framing on attentional biases for positive vs. negative stimuli in an evaluation task. In addition, valence bias predicted risk-seeking vs. risk-averse decisions and mediated the effect of framing on decision making. Two additional experiments investigated effects of valence biases on risky decision making by manipulating affective processing directly with an attention training task. Inducing a positivity (negativity) bias produced risk-seeking (risk-averse) decision behavior by enhancing the salience of win- or loss-related information in a gambling task with ambivalent color stimuli (Experiment 2) and by enhancing the impact of gain or loss outcomes on decision making in a coin toss (Experiment 3). © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of the present study was to examine the contributions to decision making (DM) deficits in schizophrenia (SZ) patients of expected value (EV) estimation and loss aversion. Patients diagnosed with SZ (n=46) and healthy controls (n=34) completed two gambling tasks. In one task, participants chose between two options with the same EV across two conditions: Loss frames and Keep frames. A second task involved accepting or rejecting gambles, in which gain and loss amounts varied, determining the EV of each trial. SZ patients showed a reduced \"framing effect\" relative to controls, as they did not show an increased tendency to gamble when faced with a certain loss. SZ patients also showed a reduced tendency to modify behavior as a function of EV. The degree to which choices tracked EV correlated significantly with several cognitive measures in both patients and controls. SZ patients show distinct deviations from normal behavior under risk when their decisions are based on prospective outcomes. These deviations are two-fold: cognitive deficits prevent value-based DM in more-impaired patients, and in less-impaired patients there is a lack of influence from well-established subjective biases found in healthy people. These abnormalities likely affect everyday DM strategies in schizophrenia patients. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

This article presents an economic loss assessment framework which has not only been developed to value these assets, but more importantly addresses the fundamental economic principles commonly lacking in other frameworks. Five severe south-eastern Australian wildfires were used as case studies to examine the utility of the framework. The impact and cost data collected as part of this framework provide valuable information for a range of applications, such as measuring the efficacy of government response and recovery arrangements and programmes, shaping policies and providing businesses with disaster information on which they can make decisions. Some areas requiring further research were identified.

      "Abstract: Decision making under risk entails the anticipation of prospective outcomes, typically leading to the greater sensitivity to losses than gains known as loss aversion. Previous studies on the neural bases of choice-outcome anticipation and loss aversion provided inconsistent results, showing either bidirectional mesolimbic responses of activation for gains and deactivation for losses, or a specific amygdala involvement in processing losses. Here we focused on loss aversion with the aim to address interindividual differences in the neural bases of choice-outcome anticipation. Fifty-six healthy human participants accepted or rejected 104 mixed gambles offering equal (50%) chances of gaining or losing different amounts of money while their brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We report both bidirectional and gain/loss-specific responses while evaluating risky gambles, with amygdala and posterior insula specifically tracking the magnitude of potential losses. At the individual level, loss aversion was reflected both in limbic fMRI responses and in gray matter volume in a structural amygdala-thalamus-striatum network, in which the volume of the \"output\" centromedial amygdala nuclei mediating avoidance behavior was negatively correlated with monetary performance. We conclude that outcome anticipation and ensuing loss aversion involve multiple neural systems, showing functional and structural individual variability directly related to the actual financial outcomes of choices. By supporting the simultaneous involvement of both appetitive and aversive processing in economic decision making, these results contribute to the interpretation of existing inconsistencies on the neural bases of anticipating choice outcomes. © 2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

A total of 162 undergraduates - Africans, Caucasians, Singaporeans and Chinese - are recruited for this study. From the risk choices that students take, we can see how Singaporeans differ from their counterparts elsewhere. The results show that Singaporeans are less risk averse than African or Caucasian exchange students. In terms of risk seeking behavior, when using Caucasians as a reference group, Singaporeans and Chinese undergraduates are also relatively more risk seeking as well. The majority of the players are risk neutral in this experiment.

      "Abstract: The World Health Organization defines a disaster as any occurrence that causes damage, destruction, ecological disruption, loss of human life, human suffering, deterioration of health and health services on a scale sufficient to warrant an extraordinary response from outside the affected community or area (Haghani and Oh, 1996 [1]). Natural disasters can be devastating in terms of human injuries and economic damages. For example, the two earthquakes that occurred in the Marmara region of Turkey in 1999 caused over 20,000 casualties and resulted in the collapse of more than 110,000 buildings (Karaman et al., 2008 [2]). The total cost of damage from these two earthquakes is estimated to range between 9 and 13 billion dollars (Bibbee et al., 2000 [3]). And in the recent Van, Erciş earthquakes, 644 people died and 35,000 houses collapsed (Van, Turkey Earthquake, 2011 [4]).It is obvious that earthquake disaster is a serious and intractable problem that threatens the ability of a nation to protect human lives and property losses. The extent of the casualties and economic damage calls for finding efficient solutions to important problems with the aim of enhancing the capability of reducing the impacts of such events and providing a quick and efficient response by rapidly supplying relief items such as emergency food, water, and medicine to those areas that are severely affected (Beamon and Balcik, 2008 [5]). The main motivation for this study is to reduce the number of casualties and to protect national properties (e.g. national infrastructure etc.) by showing disaster related problems' studies. Developing mathematical models for disaster-related problems and solving them by using operations research techniques have received increasing interest due to their efficiency in tackling these problems. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Fluid intelligence decreases with age, yet evidence about age declines in decision-making quality is mixed: Depending on the study, older adults make worse, equally good, or even better decisions than younger adults. We propose a potential explanation for this puzzle, namely that age differences in decision performance result from the interplay between two sets of cognitive capabilities that impact decision making, one in which older adults fare worse (i.e., fluid intelligence) and one in which they fare better (i.e., crystallized intelligence). Specifically, we hypothesized that older adults' higher levels of crystallized intelligence can provide an alternate pathway to good decisions when the fluid intelligence pathway declines. The performance of older adults relative to younger adults therefore depends on the relative importance of each type of intelligence for the decision at hand. We tested this complementary capabilities hypothesis in a broad sample of younger and older adults, collecting a battery of standard cognitive measures and measures of economically important decision-making \"traits\"-including temporal discounting, loss aversion, financial literacy, and debt literacy. We found that older participants performed as well as or better than younger participants on these four decision-making measures. Structural equation modeling verified our hypothesis: Older participants' greater crystallized intelligence offset their lower levels of fluid intelligence for temporal discounting, financial literacy, and debt literacy, but not for loss aversion. These results have important implications for public policy and for the design of effective decision environments for older adults. © 2013 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many rural areas of the United States are experiencing population decline due to out-migration. However, others-especially those places rich in natural amenities and recreational opportunities-are attracting new residents and losing less of their native population. In this article we investigate the predictors of rural Americans' migration intentions by examining how individual-level community assessments, including community attachment and perceptions of community-level problems, shape rural Americans' migration decision making while controlling for individual and place effects. Drawing on survey data from 17,000 residents in 11 different rural areas around the United States, we find that community attachment is a key predictor of rural migration, even during periods of economic recession, and regardless of individual and place characteristics or perceptions of community-level problems. We also find that multiple dimensions of community attachment (e.g., practical, natural, family, community trust) have independent effects on the propensity of rural residents to migrate. Our research contributes to knowledge on migration trends among rural Americans by exploring the complicated reasoning behind why people stay in, or move to, certain rural communities and not others. © 2013, by the Rural Sociological Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Loss is a form of financial distress that refers to total costs of a company exceeding its total revenues. The purpose of this study is to develop models to predict the occurrence of future loss for large construction companies. To ensure the models are useful to both internal and external stakeholders, the study employs a broad range of financial accounting and market variables calculated from publicly available data. The main part of the study develops two models: a full model consisting of 17 predictors, and a reduced model consisting of 11 selected predictors. Both models are developed using a training sample consisting of 959 loss firm-years and 2,313 nonloss firm-years and are validated using a test sample consisting of 368 loss firm-years and 1,035 nonloss firm-years during a sample period spanning the years 1976 to 2010. The models suggest that the level of sales revenue, average sales revenue generated by one unit of total asset, net worth per unit of fixed assets, operating expenses, leverage, presence of special items and foreign transactions, and type of stock exchange are useful factors for predicting loss status. The models also indicate that construction companies engaging in material manufacture and fabrication and those engaging in design and consulting are more likely to experience loss than other types of construction companies. Both models have fairly good out-of-sample prediction accuracy, that is, approximately 74% accuracy in predicting loss and 70% accuracy in predicting nonloss status. Users may find the reduced model more appealing because it involves fewer predictors but offers comparable prediction accuracy. In addition, the research develops a model for predicting future loss in 2 years and a model for predicting a high level of loss the next year. This paper contributes to the scarce literature on construction companies' financial distress. The models developed in the paper are useful to give stakeholders an early warning about a construction company's declining financial health, information that will help investors to make better investment decisions and provide notice to executives so they can take necessary steps to prevent more severe financial distress. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents two studies on narrow bracketing and myopic loss aversion. The first study shows that the tendency to segregate multiple gambles is eliminated if subjects face a certainty equivalent or a probability equivalent task instead of a binary choice. The second study argues that the behavioral differences previously attributed entirely to myopic loss aversion are partly because long-term return properties are simply easier to grasp if the return information is already provided in the form of long-term returns rather than one-year returns. Both results may be related to recent failures to replicatemyopic loss aversion. When the choice situation is structured in such a way that it draws respondents' attention to the final outcome distribution and/or if severe misestimations of long-term returns based on short-term return information are unlikely, behavioral differences consistent with myopic loss aversion are less likely to be observed. © 2013.

      "Abstract: Humans often lie strategically. We study this problem in an ultimatum game with an informed proposer and an uninformed responder, where the former can send an unverifiable statement about his endowment. A simple message game with heterogenous players with respect to lying costs shows that in equilibrium liars should understate their endowment. The second part of the paper reports on an experiment testing this game. On average, 88.5% of the proposers understate the actual endowment by 20.5%. Regression analysis shows that a 1-euro gap between the actual and declared amounts prompts proposers to reduce their offer by 19 cents on average. However, responders' decision to accept/reject the offer does not depend on the message. It results a net welfare loss specific to such a \"free-to-lie\" environment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article focuses on the influence of framing on the way people understand their contractual obligations. A large body of both psychological and economic studies suggests that people treat payoffs framed as gains and payoffs framed as losses distinctly. Building on these studies, we hypothesize that the ways parties understand their duties are affected by the way in which they are framed. More specifically, we expect that promisors will tend to adopt a more self-serving interpretation when they are making decisions in the domain of losses. To test this prediction, we run a series of four experiments that are all based on a between-subject design. The first two studies utilize experimental surveys that measure and compare participants' attitudes toward a contract interpretation dilemma. The third and fourth studies are incentive-compatible experiments, in which participants' actual interpretive decisions determine their payoff. All four experiments confirm our basic hypothesis and show that framing contractual payoffs as losses rather than as gains raises parties' tendency to interpret their obligations selfishly. These findings refine some of the previous understanding regarding the ability of penalties to optimize parties' contractual behavior, especially in situations in which monitoring is limited. Based on these findings, the article revisits some of the basic questions of contract law, shedding new light on an array of issues such as the law of liquidated damages and the optimal design of contracts. © 2013, Cornell Law School and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aims: (1) To identify factors that older adults find encouraging or discouraging about the prospect of relocation to a retirement village; and (2) to identify features or facilities often associated with retirement communities that are most appealing to prospective residents. Method: Randomly selected community residents (n = 517), aged 55-94 years, from the Australian Capital Territory completed postal surveys to identify the characteristics associated with retirement villages that influence relocation decisions. Results: The provision of outdoor living areas, support in maintaining independence, assisted living facilities and accessibility to medical facilities were identified as factors that would encourage relocation. Luxury services (e.g. heated swimming pools) were indicated as least likely to encourage relocation. Negative perceptions most influential in discouraging relocation reflected a fear of losing independence and privacy. Conclusions: Through identifying the expectations of prospective residents, retirement village providers may better tailor facilities to the needs of their target demographic.© 2012 The Authors.

We find a significant relationship between the losses and deductible choices of insureds in Florida's residual homeowners' insurance market. This relationship provides strong evidence of the existence of an adverse selection problem in Florida's residual property insurance market. While this relationship is important to Florida regulators (and taxpayers) specifically, a finding of an adverse selection problem in residual markets in general has implications more broadly for government providers of insurance as an adverse selection problem in these settings will impact the public policy debates and decisions involving these markets. © 2013 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Preference learning has been a topic of research in many fields, including operations research, marketing, machine learning, and behavioral economics. In this work, we strive to combine the ideas from these different fields into a single methodology to learn preferences and make decisions. We use robust and integer optimization in an adaptive and dynamic way to determine preferences from data that are consistent with human behavior. We use integer optimization to address human inconsistency, robust optimization and conditional value at risk (CVaR) to address loss aversion, and adaptive conjoint analysis and linear optimization to frame the questions to learn preferences. The paper makes the following methodological contributions: to the robust optimization literature by proposing a method to derive uncertainty sets from adaptive questionnaires, to the marketing literature by using the analytic center of discrete sets (as opposed to polyhedra) to capture errors and inconsistencies, and to the risk modeling literature by using efficient methods from computer science for sampling to optimize CVaR.

      "Abstract: The nature of utility is controversial. Whereas decision theory commonly assumes that utility is context specific, applied and empirical decision analysis typically assumes one unifying concept of utility applicable to all decision problems. This controversy has hardly been addressed empirically because of the absence of methods to measure utility outside the context of risk. We introduce a method to measure utility over time and compare utility under risk and utility over time. We distinguish between gains and losses and also measure loss aversion. In two experiments we found that utility under risk and utility over time differed and were uncorrelated. Utility under risk was more curved than utility over time. Subjects were loss averse both for risk and for time, but loss aversion was more pronounced for risk. Loss aversion over risk and time were uncorrelated. This suggests that loss aversion, although important in both decision contexts, is volatile and subject to framing. © 2013 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Even when considered purely as strategic choices, decisions about deceptive communication are unusually complex and difficult to predict or analyze. The costs and benefits of deceptive and honest communication options may lie in very different domains, making direct comparison cognitively challenging. In this study, we use everyday scenarios to assess people's sensitivity to various aspects of such choices, including the probability that a deception will be detected and the costs and benefits associated with successful or failed deception. Factor analysis yields three composite determinants, which we interpret as sensitivities to (1) justifiability of deception, (2) benefit of successful deception, and (3) personal utility of honesty. We show that the relative strengths of these determinants differ in loss- vs. gain-facing scenarios: decision makers facing a probabilistic or certain loss take account of all three factors, while those facing a gain do not appear to make significant use of information about the magnitude of the potential benefit from deception. We discuss several potential explanations for this asymmetry. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

The signals are assumed to be independent conditional on an unknown payoff-relevant parameter. The decision maker minimizes a quadratic loss function. Quadratic losses arise in quality control, scoring rules, and other applications. We characterize two concepts of diminishing marginal value of information. The first is an ex ante concept, before any information is observed, and the second is an ex post concept, after observation of previous information signals.

      "Abstract: Trait sensation-seeking, defined as a need for varied, complex, and intense sensations, represents a relatively underexplored hedonic drive in human behavioral neuroscience research. It is related to increased risk for a range of behaviors including substance use, gambling, and risky sexual practice. Individual differences in self-reported sensation-seeking have been linked to brain dopamine function, particularly at D2-like receptors, but so far no causal evidence exists for a role of dopamine in sensation-seeking behavior in humans. Here, we investigated the effects of the selective D2/D3 agonist cabergoline on performance of a probabilistic risky choice task in healthy humans using a sensitive within-subject, placebo-controlled design. Cabergoline significantly influenced the way participants combined different explicit signals regarding probability and loss when choosing between response options associated with uncertain outcomes. Importantly, these effects were strongly dependent on baseline sensation-seeking score. Overall, cabergoline increased sensitivity of choice to information about probability of winning; while decreasing discrimination according to magnitude of potential losses associated with different options. The largest effects of the drug were observed in participants with lower sensation-seeking scores. These findings provide evidence that risk-taking behavior in humans can be directly manipulated by a dopaminergic drug, but that the effectiveness of such a manipulation depends on baseline differences in sensation-seeking trait. This emphasizes the importance of considering individual differences when investigating manipulation of risky decision-making, and may have relevance for the development of pharmacotherapies for disorders involving excessive risk-taking in humans, such as pathological gambling. © 2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

Wetland restoration can avoid destruction of the artefacts due to agricultural cultivation and drainage, and in addition improve biological diversity and recreational opportunities. The results indicate that even though the artefacts are not visible or usable for the population of today, but may contain information and potential value for future generations, the strongest preferences displayed is for ensuring permanent protection of archaeological artefacts, rather than biological diversity and recreational opportunities.

AL within a reasonable relationship is combined with retrofit cost and discount rate to obtain the amount of net losses and minimum time required for the economic feasibility of each retrofit alternative. The prescribed methodology is used for assessing the steel resisting frame that has been retrofitted with three different methods.

      "Abstract: This paper provides a foundation for decision making with bounded rationality in economic entities from the viewpoint of evolutionary theory. To this end, first, we conducted an investment test with participants to extract a behavioral learning model for activities with bounded rationality. We found that the decision-making model obtained from this behavioral science approach has characteristics that are frequently seen in the results of observations of instances of bounded rationality. Furthermore, the model presents some well-known biases in decision making, such as profit-and-loss asymmetry in risk avoidance, reference point dependence, and the asset effect. Next, using agent-based simulations, we examined whether our behavioral-learning model for activities had the capacity to become a stable strategy in a market environment where selection pressure exists. When, in response to maximum loss, a drawdown is set as an evaluation criterion for selection, the results of our simulations imply the following: 1) our decision-making model with bounded rationality has the capacity to become a stable evolutionary strategy and 2) entities with bounded rationality can survive in a competitive market. These results are antithetical to the evolutionary explanations used as a basis for rationality in traditional economics, and they indicate the possibility that many well-known biases in decision making can be derived evolutionarily from a single criterion. © 1997-2012 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

Yet, despite evidence that universities in Ireland have experienced considerable institutional change in recent years, there remains a considerable dearth of research on its consequences for faculty participation in governance and decision-making processes. A case study of the School of Business at University College Dublin is used to illustrate how a programme of large-scale institutional change has transformed the school's decision-making processes, and the participation and influence of faculty in those processes. While the case study points to the reduced involvement of faculty in university governance, the most significant finding highlights the move towards a much more executive-style approach to management, and a substantial loss of influence and involvement by faculty in school decision-making. © 2013 European Higher Education Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Using hedging theories, we analyse the variables that determine the decision to hedge with foreign currency debt. Using a sample of 100 Spanish companies with a significant social and economic role in Latin American during 2004‐2007, we estimated probit models for panel data. Our results showed that the main determinants are scale economies and the use of derivatives. On the one hand, we found that this hedging is positively related to tax loss carry‐forwards and long‐term economic sectors, and on the other, that it is related negatively to information asymmetries and growth opportunities. Results were mixed for foreign currency exposure. The limitations of this paper are associated to the availability of information from annual reports and the SABI database, especially the variables in relation to operational hedging. Therefore, as a future line of research, we propose gathering of data on these internal hedging practices in order to obtain more accurate evidence about its use in companies and their relationship with financial hedging. This paper makes three major contributions to the existing literature. First, it contributes by illustrating currency hedging practices used by Spanish firms – which are important in Latin markets – to manage exchange rate exposure in. Second, we used more variables for the empirical analyses to contrast the hedging theories than previous studies had. Finally, we used a data panel because it allows the control of unobservable heterogeneity and endogeneity problems.

      "Abstract: Objective:Drug users and HIV-seropositive individuals often show deficits in decision-making; however the nature of these deficits is not well understood. Recent studies have employed computational modeling approaches to disentangle the psychological processes involved in decision-making. Although such approaches have been used successfully with a number of clinical groups including drug users, no study to date has used computational modeling to examine the effects of HIV on decision-making. In this study, we use this approach to investigate the effects of HIV and drug use on decision-making processes in women, who remain a relatively understudied population.Method:Fifty-seven women enrolled in the Women's Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) were classified into one of four groups based on their HIV status and history of crack cocaine and/or heroin drug use (DU): HIV+/DU+ (n = 14); HIV+/DU- (n = 17); HIV-/DU+ (n = 14); and HIV-/DU- (n = 12). We measured decision-making with the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and examined behavioral performance and model parameters derived from the best-fitting computational model of the IGT.Results:Although groups showed similar behavioral performance, HIV and DU exhibited differential relationship to model parameters. Specifically, DU was associated with compromised learning/memory and reduced loss aversion, whereas HIV was associated with reduced loss aversion, but was not related to other model parameters.Conclusions:Results reveal that HIV and DU have differential associations with distinct decision-making processes in women. This study contributes to a growing line of literature which shows that different psychological processes may underlie similar behavioral performance in various clinical groups and may be associated with distinct functional outcomes. © 2013 Vassileva et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Data on the cost-effectiveness of the behavioral treatment of obesity are not conclusive. The cost-effectiveness of treatment in primary care settings is particularly relevant.Methods:We conducted a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis of a primary care-based obesity intervention. Study participants were randomized to: Usual Care (UC; quarterly visits with their primary care provider); Brief Lifestyle Counseling (BLC; quarterly provider visits plus monthly weight loss counseling visits) or Enhanced Brief Lifestyle Counseling (EBLC; all above interventions, plus choice of meal replacements or weight loss medication). A health-care payer perspective was used. Intervention costs were estimated from tracking data obtained prospectively. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated with the EuroQol-5D. We estimated cost per kilogram-year of weight loss and cost per QALY.Results:Weight losses after 2 years were 1.7, 2.9 and 4.6 kg for UC, BLC and EBLC, respectively (P=0.003 for comparison of EBLC vs UC). The incremental cost per kilogram-year lost was $292 for EBLC compared with UC (95% confidence interval (CI): $219–$437). The short-term incremental cost per QALY was $115 397, but the 95% CI were undefined. Comparison of short-term cost per kg with published estimates of longer-term cost per QALY suggested that the intervention could be cost-effective over the long term (⩾10 years).Conclusions:A primary care intervention that includes monthly counseling visits and a choice of meal replacements or weight loss medication could be a cost-effective treatment for obesity over the long term. However, additional studies are needed on the cost-effectiveness of behavioral treatment of obesity. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study employs the ordered lottery selection approach with field experiment to measure risk attitude of two distinct population groups in China-farmers in Wuhan and freelancers in media and advertising in Beijing. A comparative design was used to reveal the cross-population difference in risk attitude and its affecting factors. The results showed that both groups exhibited constant partial risk aversion and decreasing absolute risk aversion, while the farmers were more risk-averse than the freelancers. The farmer and freelancer respondents demonstrated very different sensitivity to the warming-up games types involving gain-only or gain-loss while extremely risk-averse respondents in the warming-up games possessed the consistent attitudinal behavior in the formal tests. The comparative experiment revealed that gender and income were two statistically significant factors affecting risk attitude and they appeared to be consistent across the two distinct groups. Surprisingly, respondents perceived frequency of risk occurrence was not correlated to their risk attitude. Moreover, the factors of leisure and investment behavior were significantly linked to the freelancers risk attitude but not the farmers. The experiment also found a non-linear relationship between risk attitude and education, and receiving college education was found to be a critical switching point that was significantly linked to respondents risk choices. While further research is needed to better understand the governing mechanism in risk attitude, perception, and behavior, this paper tried to link the experimental results to the natural disaster insurance practice in China and discussed their implication to the policy design. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the United States, end-stage liver disease patients join a waiting list and then make accept/reject decisions for transplantation as deceased-donor organs are offered to them over time. These decisions are largely influenced by the patient's prospect for future offers, which can be ascertained most accurately by knowing the entire composition of the waiting list. Under the current transplantation system, however, the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), in an effort to strike a balance between privacy and transparency, only publishes an aggregated version of the waiting list. However, it is not clear whether the published information is good enough (compared with perfect information) to help patients make optimal decisions that maximize their individual life expectancies. We provide a novel model of this accept/reject problem from an individual patient's perspective using a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework, which incorporates the imperfect waiting list information as published currently into the patient's decision making. We analyze structural properties of this model. In particular, we establish conditions that guarantee a monotone value function and a threshold-type optimal policy with respect to the partially observable rank state that captures the imperfect waiting list information. Furthermore, we develop an improved solution methodology to solve a generic POMDP model. This solution method guarantees, for any fixed grid, the best possible approximation to the optimal value function by solving linear programs to compute the optimal weights used for the approximation. Finally, we compare, in a clinically driven numerical study, the results of this model with those of an existing Markov decision process model that differs from our model in assuming the availability of perfect waiting list information. This comparison allows us to assess the quality of the published imperfect information as measured by a patient's so-called price of privacy (i.e., the opportunity loss in expected life days due to a lack of perfect waiting list information). Previous work estimates a significant loss in a patient's life expectancy, on average, when the patient has no waiting list information compared with full information. In this paper, we find that the currently published partial information is nearly sufficient to eliminate this loss, resulting in a negligible price of privacy and supporting current UNOS practice. © 2013 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risk avoidance is an important determinant of human behavior. The neurotransmitter serotonin has been implicated in processing negative outcomes caused by risky decisions. However, it is unclear whether serotonin provides a neurobiological link between making a risk aversive decision and the response to a negative outcome. Using pharmacological fMRI, we manipulated the availability of serotonin in healthy volunteers while performing a gambling task. The same group of participants was studied in three fMRI sessions: (i) during intravenous administration of the SSRI citalopram to increase the serotonergic tone, (ii) after acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) to reduce central serotonin levels, or (iii) without interventions. ATD and citalopram had opposite effects on outcome related activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and amygdala. Relative to the control condition, ATD increased and citalopram decreased the neural response to negative outcomes in dmPFC. Conversely, ATD decreased and citalopram increased the neural response to negative outcomes in left amygdala. Critically, these pharmacological effects were restricted to negative outcomes that were caused by low-risk decisions and led to a high missed reward. ATD and citalopram did not alter the neural response to positive outcomes in dmPFC, but relative to ATD, citalopram produced a bilateral increase in the amygdala response to large wins caused by high-risk choices. The results show a selective involvement of the serotonergic system in neocortical processing of negative outcomes resulting from risk-averse decisions, thereby linking risk aversion and processing of negative outcomes in goal-directed behaviors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Poker is a game of skill and chance, where players often experience significant monetary losses. Detrimental out-of-control poker decision-making due to negative emotions is known as tilting. A qualitative assessment of losing and tilting was conducted by analysing stories about significant monetary losses, written by Finnish on-line poker players (N = 60). Thematic and narrative analyses uncovered five themes and a narrative structure underlying the aetiology and phenomenology of tilting. Tilting, in the narratives, was often instigated by dissociative feelings ('unreality', disbelief) following a significant monetary loss. Thereafter, moral indignation was experienced, followed by chasing behaviour, in an attempt to restore a 'fair balance' between wins and losses. In the aftermath of tilting, self-focused feelings of disappointment, depression and/or anxiety, and sleeping problems were experienced. It was also observed that experienced players, as compared to inexperienced ones, exhibited in their narratives a more mature disposition towards encountering 'bad luck', and losing in general. The results are relevant in better understanding psychological processes related to losing in the multifaceted game of poker, thus contributing also to existing knowledge on detrimental gambling behaviour. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper addresses the role of negative asymmetries in emotional self-prediction by looking at the extent to which individuals misestimate their own betting behavior in sequential gambles. In a series of three experimental studies, we demonstrate that losses lead to higher than planned bets whereas bets are on average carried over after gains. Such asymmetric deviations from the plan emerge (1) when monetary and non-monetary incentives are used, and (2) when participants face fair and unfair gambles. The asymmetry is based on people’s inability to predict how much the negative emotions generated by a bad experience (e.g. the loss) will influence them to put more effort (e.g. bet more) than planned in an attempt to re-establish a homeostatic state in the prospect of a good experience (e.g. winning). © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The Productivity Commission's 2010 report confirmed that gambling is a fundamental aspect of contemporary Australian culture. This is likely to become even more entrenched with the increasingly prominent association between gambling and professional sport. In addition, since the liberalisation of gambling in Australia during the 1990s, governments have become heavily dependent upon gambling revenue. The role of the law as a regulator of the excesses of gambling is complex, both in respect of criminal matters and recourse sought by gamblers against gambling houses where they have lost significant sums of money. The decision of the High Court in Kakavas v Crown Melbourne Limited [2013] HCA 25 confines the potential for gamblers to sue casinos and bookmakers in equity for unconscionably exploiting their vulnerabilities. However, it leaves open a door for such actions to be brought by some categories of persons whose inability to exercise rational judgment in respect of their DSM-5 gambling disorder, or some other form of vulnerability, can be proved to have been known by casinos and bookmakers. This will be relatively rare but such actions remain feasible. © 2013 The Australian and New Zealand Association of Psychiatry, Psychology and Law.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Unfairness plays an important role in economic decision making. This fMRI study sought to investigate how the loss and the gain contexts could modulate behavioral and brain responses to unfairness by focusing on participants' rejection behaviors during an Ultimatum Game paradigm. Participants were scanned while they were playing the Ultimatum Game as responders in both loss and gain contexts, i.e. receiving ¥50 as gains and paying for ¥50 as losses. At the behavioral level, lower fairness ratings and higher rejection rates were revealed for unfair losses than unfair gains. At the neural level, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex/anterior middle cingulate cortex and bilateral dorsal striatum were associated with rejection (vs. acceptance) in the loss context, but not in the gain context. Together, our data indicated that participants may experience more unfairness in UG and stronger desire to sanction social norm violations in the loss context than in the gain context, inducing more fairness-related neutral activities when rejecting (vs. accepting) unfair losses than unfair gains. These findings shed light on the significance of context (i.e. loss or gain) in fairness-related social decision-making processes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Hedonic editing refers to the decision strategy of arranging multiple events in time to maximize hedonic outcomes (Thaler in Market Sci 4:199-214, 1985). The present research investigated the relationship between subjective well-being and hedonic editing. In Study 1, we gave participants pairs of social or financial events and asked them to indicate their preferences regarding the sequence and interval length between the two events. Compared to participants with lower subjective well-being, those with higher subjective well-being preferred to experience a social gain (e.g., chatting with a close friend) temporally closer to a financial loss, suggesting that happy individuals are more inclined than less happy individuals to use positive social events as cross-domain buffers against loss. In Study 2, participants were asked to select the type of positive event they would want to experience after a negative event. Happy individuals displayed a stronger preference for social events.

      "Abstract: This paper presents the Bomb Risk Elicitation Task (BRET), an intuitive procedure aimed at measuring risk attitudes. Subjects decide how many boxes to collect out of 100, one of which contains a bomb. Earnings increase linearly with the number of boxes accumulated but are zero if the bomb is also collected. The BRET requires minimal numeracy skills, avoids truncation of the data, allows the precise estimation of both risk aversion and risk seeking, and is not affected by the degree of loss aversion or by violations of the Reduction Axiom. We validate the BRET, test its robustness in a large-scale experiment, and compare it to three popular risk elicitation tasks. Choices react significantly only to increased stakes, and are sensible to wealth effects. Our experiment rationalizes the gender gap that often characterizes choices under uncertainty by means of a higher loss rather than risk aversion. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose – Consumers frequently find themselves having to choose between various product brands that differ in price and quality. The purpose of this paper is to examine several possible factors that may affect this choice: message framing of the choice as either gain or loss of money or quality, consumer involvement, and consumers’ perceived monetary and quality gains. Design/methodology/approach – In all, 837 participants from Portugal, Turkey, and Israel were randomly assigned to a positively or negatively framed message regarding the quality or price of two alternative brands of sunscreen lotion. Findings – As expected, highly involved consumers show a higher preference for the better and more expensive product than less involved consumers, while perceived monetary or quality gains mediates this relation. Challenging previous findings, negative framing of loss avoidance affects perceived gains and brand choice more than positive framing only for less involved participants, rather than for highly involved ones. Research limitations/implications – Although the results were replicated in three different countries, future research of message framing context on other products is needed, as well as research in the context of goal framing. Practical implications – If indeed future research would replicate the higher effectiveness of positive framing among highly involved consumers, retailers should consider that in planning their product promotion strategy. Originality/value – This study challenges the current literature regarding the effect of message framing on message and the moderating role of involvement. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Although many studies have identified public preferences for prioritising health care interventions based on characteristics of recipient or care, very few of them have examined the reasons for the stated preferences. We conducted an on-line person trade-off (PTO) study (N=1030) to investigate whether the public attach a premium to the avoidance of ill health associated with alternative types of responsibilities: lapses in healthcare safety, those caused by individual action or lifestyle choice; or genetic conditions. We found that the public gave higher priority to prevention of harm in a hospital setting such as preventing hospital associated infections than genetic disorder but drug administration errors were valued similar to genetic disorders. Prevention of staff injuries, lifestyle diseases and sports injuries, were given lower priority. In this paper we aim to understand the reasoning behind the responses by analysing comments provided by respondents to the PTO questions. Method. A majority of the respondents who participated in the survey provided brief comments explaining preferences in free text responses following PTO questions. This qualitative data was transformed into explicit codes conveying similar meanings. An overall coding framework was developed and a reliability test was carried out. Recurrent patterns were identified in each preference group. Comments which challenged the assumptions of hypothetical scenarios were also investigated. Results: NHS causation of illness and a duty of care were the most cited reasons to prioritise lapses in healthcare safety. Personal responsibility dominated responses for lifestyle related contexts, and many respondents mentioned that health loss was the result of the individual's choice to engage in risky behaviour. A small proportion of responses questioned the assumptions underlying the PTO questions. However excluding these from the main analysis did not affect the conclusions. Conclusion: Although some responses indicated misunderstanding or rejection of assumptions we put forward, the results were still robust. The reasons put forward for responses differed between comparisons but responsibility was the most frequently cited. Most preference elicitation studies only focus on eliciting numerical valuations but allowing for qualitative data can augment understanding of preferences as well as verifying results. © 2013 Singh et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose - The present paper aims to introduce a new methodology taking risk behavior of decision maker into account to fine-tune the value of a risky public-private-partnership (PPP) project and the corresponding cost of capital based on the target rate of return set by the project sponsor and the degree of project risks. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology combines the cumulative prospect theory (CPT) to characterize the risk preference of the project sponsor and the Monte Carlo simulation to assess the project riskiness. The methodology requires a pre-set target rate of return that will define the relative gains and losses for a prospect theory project sponsor. The application was illustrated using a build/operate/transfer toll road project as a case study. Findings - As the project sponsor sets a greater target return, the probability of the project not meeting the target is accordingly greater. Given that losses have greater impact than gains on the decision, other things being equal, a higher target return leads to a higher value correction. It has also been demonstrated that the corresponding project's cost of capital can be up- or downadjusted depending on the project's riskiness which may result in a reverse preference to favor a higher risk scenario. Research limitations/implications - The methodology uses the CPT parameters that need to be further confirmed and validated if applied to value large risky projects like PPP investments. Originality/value - The proposed methodology offers a different approach to correctly value a risky PPP project by extending the application of the cumulative prospect theory that well explains the irrationality of human decision behavior under risk into a financial decision-making process. It takes the full benefit of simulation to understand project risks and also assists financial decision-making. Copyright © 2013 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background. The purpose of this study was to determine if newly diagnosed breast cancer patients undergoing contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) experience more complications than patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy (UM). Methods. A total of 600 patients underwent either UM or CPM between January 2009 and March 2012 for unilateral breast cancer. Operative complications were classified as minor (aspirations, infection requiring antibiotics, partial flap and nipple necrosis, minor bleeding, delayed wound healing) or major (hematoma or seroma requiring operation, infection requiring rehospitalization, blood product transfusion, total flap or nipple loss, implant removal), mixed (both minor and major complications), or multiple. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regressions were used for the analysis. Results. Of the 600 patients, 391 (65 %) underwent UM and 209 (35 %) underwent CPM. Across all complication groups, there were significantly more complications in the CPM group versus the UM group (41.6 vs. 28.6 %, p = 0.001). Major complications alone were significantly greater in the CPM versus the UM group (13.9 vs. 4.1 %, p\\0.001). When adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking and diabetes history, AJCC stage, reconstruction, previous radiation therapy, and adjuvant therapy, CPM patients were 1.5 times more likely to have any complication (odds ratio [OR] 1.53; 95 % CI 1.04-2.25, p = 0.029) and 2.7 times more likely to have a major complication compared with UM patients (OR 2.66; 95 % CI 1.37-5.19, p = 0.004). Conclusions. CPM patients have an increased risk of complications, especially major complications requiring rehospitalization or reoperation. These complications may influence patient and physician decisions to choose CPM. © Society of Surgical Oncology 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article presents a study of three asylum-seeking men from Iran and Afghanistan. It aimed to explore how and if they experienced occupations as occupations in a Danish asylum centre and how their life experience shaped their choice and value of current occupations. In-depth narrative interviews explored the participants' occupational history and its influence on their current occupations in the asylum centre. A thematic analysis showed that the participants had been subjected to occupational disruption and deprivation by politically oppressive systems even before their flight. Their occupations in Denmark were to a certain extent influenced by their earlier occupations and the current occupational deprivation they all experienced was due to limited possibilities in the centre. Although they tried their best to fill their days and create structure, there was a loss of valued occupations and a profound sense of occupational deprivation. One of the participants had been subjected to torture and he experienced occupational deprivation to a greater extent. The findings suggest that further research should include exposure to torture as a key component when examining the occupational deprivation of asylum seekers. © 2013 The Journal of Occupational Science Incorporated.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The robust finding that people systematically assign higher monetary values to sell a good they own than they pay to acquire it (i.e., the endowment effect) was recently explained by the differential importance of positive and negative object properties, depending on endowment state. Whether this explanation can also be applied to objects with risky outcomes is not clear. Two studies using lottery tickets were designed to examine the effects of focusing on aspects consistent with a person's endowment state (i.e., probability of winning and size of winnings for owners; probability of losing and price of lottery ticket for nonowners) or inconsistent with it. In line with previous research on consumer products, both studies showed an endowment effect for lottery tickets when participants focused on consistent aspects, but not when they focused on inconsistent aspects. We conclude that, although price decisions are mainly influenced by endowment state, the underlying focus on specific properties likely plays a role in the endowment effect for risky objects. © 2013 Verlag Hans Huber, Hogrefe AG, Bern J.

      "Abstract: Although maltreated children involved with child welfare services are known to exhibit elevated levels of health-risking behaviors, little is known about their decision-making processes leading to such tendencies. Research findings suggest that maltreated children exhibit developmental delays in neurocognitive and emotional regulation systems that could adversely impact their abilities to make decisions under conditions of risk. Whereas prior researchers have examined risky decision making as a global construct, maltreated children's decision making was examined in two contexts in the present study: potential gains and potential losses. Comparing maltreated children (n = 25) and a nonmaltreated community group (n = 112), it was found that the maltreated children showed decision-making impairments for both domains: This impairment was especially prominent in the loss domain. The maltreated children took excessive risks and were insensitive to changes in expected value. Follow-up analyses revealed that these differences were primarily associated with insensitivity to changes in outcome magnitude for the risky option. Finally, response latency analyses indicated that the maltreated children were slower to make choices, reinforcing underlying differences in decision processes between groups. These results have implications for basic and translational science. © The Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: In a qualitative substudy, we sought to elicit participants' perspectives of their behavioural change and maintenance of new behaviours towards intervention optimisation. Setting: The intervention was delivered in leisure and community settings in a local authority, which according to the UK government statistics ranks as 1 of the 10 most socioeconomically deprived areas in England. Participants: We recruited 218 adults aged 40-65 years at elevated risk of type 2 diabetes (Finnish Diabetes Risk Score≥11) to the intervention. Follow-up at 12 months was completed by 134 (62%). We recruited 15 participants, purposively sampled for physical activity increase, to the qualitative substudy. Intervention: Lifestyle intervention can prevent type 2 diabetes, but translation to service provision remains challenging. The 'New life, New you' intervention aimed to promote physical activity, healthy eating and weight loss, and included supervised group physical activity sessions. Behavioural change and weight loss at 12-month follow-up were encouraging. Design: We conducted 15 individual semistructured interviews. The Framework approach, with a comparison of emerging themes, was used in analysis of the transcribed data and complemented by the Theory Domains Framework. Results: Themes emerging from the data were grouped as perceptions that promoted initiating, enacting and maintaining behavioural change. The data were then categorised in accordance with the Theory Domains Framework: intentions and goals; reinforcement; knowledge; social role and identity; social influences; skills and beliefs about capabilities; behavioural regulation, memory, emotion, attention and decision processes and environmental context and resources. Participant perceptions of intervention features that facilitated behavioural change processes were then similarly analysed. Conclusions: Social influences, reference to social role and identity (eg, peer support), and intentions and goals (eg, to lose weight) were dominant themes across the three phases of behavioural change.\u001b[0m :\n",

The main contribution of this paper finds that the covered loss and real loss treatments are statistically equivalent. This assures researchers that just introducing the notion of loss into an experimental treatment without the need for participants to realize a real loss is still a valid experimental instrument.

      "Abstract: Reference dependence, loss aversion, and risk seeking for losses together comprise the preference-based component of prospect theory that sets its value function apart from the standard risk-aversion model. Using an elasticity analysis, we show that this distinctive preference component serves to underpin negative-feedback trading propensities, but cannot manifest itself in behavior directly or holistically at the individual-choice level. We then propose and demonstrate that the market interaction between prospect-theory investors and regular CRRA investors allows this preference component to dominate in equilibrium behavior and hence helps to reestablish the intuitive link between prospect-theory preferences and negative-feedback trading patterns. In the model, the interaction also reconciles the contrarian behavior of prospect-theory investors with asymmetric volatility and short-term return reversal. The results suggest that prospect-theory preferences can lead investors to behave endogenously as contrarian noise traders in the market interaction process. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..\u001b[0m :\n",

The consequences of an evacuation strategy depend on a combination of the time available, citizen response, authority response, and capacity of the infrastructure. The literature that discusses evacuations in case of flood risk management focuses, in most cases, only on a best-case strategy as a preventive evacuation and excludes other possible strategies. This article introduces a probabilistic method, EvacuAid, to determine the benefits of different types of evacuation with regards to loss of life. The method is applied for a case study in the Netherlands for preventive and vertical evacuation due to flood risk. The results illustrate the impact of uncertainties in available time and actual conditions (e.g., the responses of citizens and authorities and the use of infrastructure). It is concluded that preparation for evacuation requires adaptive planning that takes preventive and vertical evacuation into account, based on a risk management approach. © 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Depellegrin, D. and Blažauskas, N., 2013. Integrating ecosystem service values into oil spill impact assessment. The catastrophic effects that oil spills have on coastal resources, the complex task of decision making during oil spill response, and the need for operational reasoning induce decision makers to seek science-based decisions. In light of these circumstances, spatially explicit, economic-impact assessment models can deliver an immediate assessment tool for preliminary oil-spill damage cost-quantification using a monetary unit as an indicator. The model presented in this study is based on an ecosystem-services assessment using economic evaluation methods such as travel cost, benefit transfer, and direct-market pricing. Ecosystem services were estimated for the 92-km-long Lithuanian coast using existing geographic information system (GIS) data sets. Outputs from the ecosystem-services assessment indicated that the total, annual economic value of biological and socioeconomic resources in the Lithuanian coastal zone (532 km2) amounts to more than €524 million/y (approximately US$690 million). Estimated values include marine biotopes, €307 million/y; recreational areas, €215 million/y; seabirds, €1.1 million/y; and commercial fisheries, €0.2 million/y. The estimation of monetary revenue from coastal resources was integrated with scenario-based cost estimation of damage supported by the Baltic Sea's three-dimensional particle-tracking model, Seatrack Web. Model testing was performed for 30 km of vulnerable Lithuanian coast with due consideration of its environmental, social, and economic importance to the SE Baltic Sea and its pertinent oil pollution risks. Results show that monetary losses of coastal resources depend highly on the oil type, impact area, meteorological conditions, and particularly the dispersion of the pollutant in the marine environment, by affecting target marine and socioeconomic resources. The damage cost-assessment tool is applicable in every coastal zone and pertinent to decision makers seeking preliminary cost estimates of damage and compensation for the damage caused by oil spills. © 2013 Coastal Education & Research Foundation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent research on risky decision-making in adults has shown that both the risk in potential outcomes and their valence (i.e., whether those outcomes involve gains or losses) exert dissociable influences on decisions. We hypothesised that the influences of these two crucial decision variables (risk and valence) on decision-making would vary developmentally during adolescence. We adapted a risk-taking paradigm that provides precise metrics for the impacts of risk and valence. Decision-making in 11-16 year old female adolescents was influenced by both risk and valence. However, their influences assumed different developmental patterns: the impact of valence diminished with age, while there was no developmental change in the impact of risk. These different developmental patterns provide further evidence that risk and valence are fundamentally dissociable constructs and have different influences on decisions across adolescence. © 2013 The Authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper examines how providing litigants with information about arbitrators' win/loss ratios affects arbitrators' incentives in deciding the cases before them in an impartial and unbiased manner. We show that if litigants are informed about arbitrators' past decisions, then arbitrators might want to make an incorrect decision when a correct decision would raise the suspicion that they are biased. Therefore, providing information about arbitrators' past decisions might create adverse incentive effects and reduce the accuracy of arbitration. We compare the accuracy of arbitrators' decisions under different arbitrator selection procedures and discuss the implications for the design of arbitration rules by arbitration and dispute resolution providers and by court-administered arbitration programs. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.

      "Abstract: Individuals make decisions under uncertainty every day. Decisions are based on incomplete information concerning the potential outcome or the predicted likelihood with which events occur. In addition, individuals' choices often deviate from the rational or mathematically objective solution. Accordingly, the dynamics of human decision making are difficult to capture using conventional, linear mathematical models. Here, we present data from a 2-choice task with variable risk between sure loss and risky loss to illustrate how a simple nonlinear dynamical system can be employed to capture the dynamics of human decision making under uncertainty (i.e., multistability, bifurcations). We test the feasibility of this model quantitatively and demonstrate how the model can account for up to 86% of the observed choice behavior. The implications of using dynamical models for explaining the nonlinear complexities of human decision making are discussed as well as the degree to which the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems might offer an alternative framework for understanding human decision making processes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In humans, dopamine is implicated in reward and risk-based decision-making. However, the specific effects of dopamine augmentation on risk evaluation are unclear. Here we sought to measure the effect of 100 mg oral levodopa, which enhances synaptic release of dopamine, on choice behaviour in healthy humans. We use a paradigm without feedback or learning, which solely isolates effects on risk evaluation. We present two studies (n = 20; n = 20) employing a randomised, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. We manipulated different dimensions of risk in a controlled economic paradigm. We test effects on risk-reward tradeoffs, assaying both aversion to variance (the spread of possible outcomes) and preference for relative losses and gains (asymmetry of outcomes - skewness), dissociating this from potential non-specific effects on choice randomness using behavioural modelling. There were no systematic effects of levodopa on risk attitudes, either for variance or skewness. However, there was a drift towards more risk-averse behaviour over time, indicating that this paradigm was sensitive to detect changes in risk-preferences. These findings suggest that levodopa administration does not change the evaluation of risk. One possible reason is that dopaminergic influences on decision making may be due to changing the response to reward feedback. © 2013 Symmonds et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The paper analyzes how central banks pay attention to foreign exchange exposure and the profit function in pursuing monetary policy. The results of the paper document that in practice, central banks do not take the microeconomic approach based on profit maximization in making decisions on the level of foreign exchange reserves or the magnitude of the open foreign exchange position. According to the authors' estimations, only the interest rate differential plays a role in central banks' decisions. Central banks do not seem to take into account in their foreign exchange interventions any possible negative impacts on the profit and loss statement that may result from an adverse exchange rate trend, the costs of sterilizing foreign exchange interventions, or high exchange rate volatility. © 2014 M.E.

      "Abstract: Introduction The burden of disease resulting from neonatal conditions is substantial in developing countries. From 2003 to 2005, the Projahnmo I programme delivered community-based interventions for maternal and newborn health in Sylhet, Bangladesh. This analysis quantifies burden of disability and incorporates non-fatal outcomes into cost-effectiveness analysis of interventions delivered in the Projahnmo I programme.Methods A decision tree model was created to predict disability resulting from preterm birth, neonatal meningitis and intrapartum-related hypoxia ('birth asphyxia'). Outcomes were defined as the years lost to disability (YLD) component of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Calculations were based on data from the Projahnmo I trial, supplemented with values from published literature and expert opinion where data were absent.Results 195 YLD per 1000 neonates [95% confidence interval (CI): 157-241] were predicted in the main calculation, sensitive to different DALY assumptions, disability weights and alternative model structures. The Projahnmo I home care intervention may have averted 2.0 (1.3-2.8) YLD per 1000 neonates. Compared with calculations based on reductions in mortality alone, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased by only 0.6% from $105.23 to $104.62 ($65.15-$266.60) when YLD were included, with 0.6% more DALYs averted [total 338/1000 (95% CI: 131-542)].Discussion A significant burden of disability results from neonatal conditions in Sylhet, Bangladesh. Adding YLD has very little impact on recommendations based on cost-effectiveness, even at the margin of programme adoption. This model provides guidance for collecting data on disabilities in new settings. © 2012 The Author; all rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, a method based on prospect theory is proposed to solve the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem with three formats of attribute aspirations. According to the idea of prospect theory, reference points concerning attributes are first determined. Then, for the three formats of attribute aspirations, the calculation formulae of alternatives' gains/losses concerning attributes are given. By calculating each alternative's gain/loss, a gain-loss matrix is constructed. Further, using the value function from prospect theory and the simple additive weighting method, the overall prospect value of each alternative is calculated. Based on the obtained overall prospect values, a ranking of alternatives can be determined. Finally, a case study is given to illustrate the use of the proposed method. © World Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Protection of native aquatic plants is an important proenvironmental behavior, because plant loss coupled with nutrient loading can produce changes in lake ecosystems. Removal of aquatic plants by lakeshore property owners is a diffuse behavior that may lead to cumulative impacts on lake ecosystems. This class of behavior is challenging to manage because collective impacts are not obvious to the actors. This paper distinguishes positive and negative beliefs about aquatic plants, in models derived from norm activation theory (Schwartz, Adv Exp Soc Psychol 10:221-279, 1977) and the theory of reasoned action (Fishbein and Ajzen, Belief, attitude, intention, and behavior: an introduction to theory and research, Addison-Wesley, Boston 1975), to examine protection of native aquatic plants by Minnesota lakeshore property owners. We clarify how positive and negative evaluations of native aquatic plants affect protection or removal of these plants. Results are based on a mail survey (n = 3,115). Results suggest that positive evaluations of aquatic plants (i.e., as valuable to lake ecology) may not connect with the global attitudes and behavioral intentions that direct plant protection or removal. Lakeshore property owners' behavior related to aquatic plants may be driven more by tangible personal benefits derived from accessible, carefully managed lakeshore than intentional action taken to sustain lake ecosystems. The limited connection of positive evaluations of aquatic plants to global attitudes and behavioral intentions may reflect either lack of knowledge of what actions are needed to protect lake health and/or unwillingness to lose perceived benefits derived from lakeshore property. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The interaction between fiscal and monetary policy is analyzed by means of a game theory approach. The coordination between these two policies is essential, since decisions taken by one institution may have disastrous effects on the other one, resulting in welfare loss for the society. We derived optimal monetary and fiscal policies in context of three coordination schemes: when each institution independently minimizes its welfare loss as a Nash equilibrium of a normal form game; when an institution moves first and the other follows, in a mechanism known as the Stackelberg solution; and, when institutions behave cooperatively, seeking common goals. In the Brazilian case, a numerical exercise shows that the smallest welfare loss is obtained under a Stackelberg solution which has the monetary policy as leader and the fiscal policy as follower. Under the optimal policy, there is evidence of a strong distaste for inflation by the Brazilian society. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Scholars believe that in order to increase the acceptance rate of GM food products that offer higher value relativeto non-GM alternatives, marketers need to sell them at an introductory price, and only after consumers get used to consuming them can their price be raised. This recommendation is consistent with consumers' demand for discounts on GM food products. This study analyzes whether the opposite strategy-which begins at building a starting point of high risk, and then at a second stage choices between GM and conventional food products are made-is an efficient tactic in introducing biotechnology. Starting high and ending at a lower point is termed the reverse foot-in-the-door tactic. We test the effectiveness of reverse footin- the-door when applied to GM products by using an experimental survey design wherein consumers are asked first to choose between purchasing two hypothetical biotechnology products-moisturizer and a pill that supports weight loss-and then GM and conventional vegetables, and comparing the results to previous findings taken from the literature. We also identify the variables of the consumers who are willing to purchase both GM beauty-enhancing productsand show that these can be used to profile consumers with high willingness to purchase GM food products.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Mechanical Turk (MTurk), an online labor system run by Amazon.com, provides quick, easy, and inexpensive access to online research participants. As use of MTurk has grown, so have questions from behavioral researchers about its participants, reliability, and low compensation. In this article, we review recent research about MTurk and compare MTurk participants with community and student samples on a set of personality dimensions and classic decision-making biases. Across two studies, we find many similarities between MTurk participants and traditional samples, but we also find important differences. For instance, MTurk participants are less likely to pay attention to experimental materials, reducing statistical power. They are more likely to use the Internet to find answers, even with no incentive for correct responses. MTurk participants have attitudes about money that are different from a community sample's attitudes but similar to students' attitudes. Finally, MTurk participants are less extraverted and have lower self-esteem than other participants, presenting challenges for some research domains. Despite these differences, MTurk participants produce reliable results consistent with standard decision-making biases: they are present biased, risk-averse for gains, risk-seeking for losses, show delay/expedite asymmetries, and show the certainty effect-with almost no significant differences in effect sizes from other samples. We conclude that MTurk offers a highly valuable opportunity for data collection and recommend that researchers using MTurk (1) include screening questions that gauge attention and language comprehension; (2) avoid questions with factual answers; and (3) consider how individual differences in financial and social domains may influence results. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It has now become widely accepted that economic decisions are influenced by cognitive and emotional processes. In the present study, we aimed at disentangling the neural mechanisms associated with the way in which the information is formulated, i.e., framing effect, in terms of gain Dr loss, which influences people's decisions. Participants played a fMRI version of the Ultimatum game where we manipulated bids through two different frames: the expression \"I give you\" (gain) focusing on money the respondent would receive if she/he agreed with the proponent, and the expression \"I take\" (loss) focusing on the money that would be removed from the respondent in the ivent that she/he accepted the offer. Neuroimaging data revealed a frame by response interaction, showing an increase of neural activity in the right rolandic operculum/insular cortex, the anterior: ingulate, among other regions, for accepting the frame \"I take\" vs. rejecting, as compared to accepting the frame \"I give you\" vs. rejecting. In addition, the left occipito-temporal junction was activated for \"I take\" vs. \"I give you\" for offer 5, corresponding to the equal offer made unpleasant by the presence of the frame \"I take\", where is the proposer that takes the money. Our data extend the current understanding of the neural substrates of social decision making, by disentangling the structures sensitive to the way in which the information is formulated (i.e., framing effect), in terms of gain or loss. © 2013 Tomasino, Lotto, Sarlo, Civai, Rumiati and Rumiati.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Over past decade, the Iowa gambling task (IGT) has been utilized to test various decision deficits induced by neurological damage or psychiatric disorders. The IGT has recently been standardized for identifying 13 different neuropsychological disorders. Neuropsychological patients choose bad decks frequently, and normal subjects prefer good expected value (EV) decks. However, the IGT has several validity and reliability problems. Some research groups have pointed out that the validity of IGT is influenced by the personality and emotional state of subjects. Additionally, several other studies have proposed that the \"prominent deck B phenomenon\" (PDB phenomenon) - that is, normal subjects preferring bad deck B - may be the most serious problem confronting IGT validity. Specifically, deck B offers a high frequency of gains but negative EV. In the standard IGT administration, choice behavior can be understood with reference to gain-loss frequency (GLF) rather than inferred future consequences (EV, the basic assumption of IGT). Furthermore, using two different criteria (basic assumption vs. professional norm) results in significantly different classification results. Therefore, we recruited 72 normal subjects to test the validity and reliability of IGT. Each subject performed three runs of the computer-based clinical IGT version. The PDB phenomenon has been observed to a significant degree in the first and second stages of the clinical IGT version. Obviously, validity, reliability, and the practice effect were unstable between two given stages. The present form of the clinical IGT version has only one stage, so its use should be reconsidered for examining normal decision makers; results from patient groups must also be interpreted with great care. GLF could be the main factor to be considered in establishing the constructional validity and reliability of the clinical IGT version. © 2013 Lin, Song, Chen, Lee and Chiu.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: This paper aims to examine the relationship between the volume of investment deposits and capitalization of Islamic commercial banks. Design/methodology/approach: Unlike current accounts holders, investment accounts holders may support part or all of the losses on assets value, which could be a source of moral hazard among bank managers and shareholders. To test these assumptions, the authors use the system generalized method of moments (system GMM) on a dynamic panel of 59 Islamic banks observed during the period 2005-2009. Findings: After controlling for a set of variables that may influence capital level, the results show a significant negative relationship between PSIA and regulatory capital ratio. This may indicate that the specific nature of PSIA can be a source of excessive risk-taking in Islamic banks. This behavior is likely to threaten the solvency of Islamic banks and shows that some deficiencies may exist in their risk management and governance system. Practical implications: This paper suggests some recommendations to better implement the principle of profit and loss sharing and to curb excessive risk-taking in Islamic banks. Originality/value: The originality of this paper is to give empirical responses to theoretical assumptions of a relationship between PSIA and moral hazard in Islamic banks. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Qualitative poor decision-making and associated altered neuronal activation patterns have been described for the users of several drugs, amongst others for stimulants like amphetamine and MDMA. Deficits in decision-making might be caused by an augmented attraction to short-term rewarding properties despite negative long-term consequences, leading to rigid stimulus-response patterns. In the present imaging study, we investigated decision-making and associated neuronal activation in three groups differing in their exposure to amphetamine and MDMA. An established paradigm on risky choices was used to evaluate decision-making performance and corresponding functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) activation. Subjects could choose between a low-risk control gamble and an experimental gamble, which always differed in the probability of winning or losing, as well as the magnitudes of monetary gain or loss. Experienced users (EU), users with low exposure to stimulants and drug-naive controls, did not differ from each other in behavioral performance. In accordance with our hypotheses, the anticipation of reward led to an activation of primarily the frontal cortex and the striatum in low-exposure users and drug-naive controls. In contrast, frontal and parietal activation was observed in all groups when the actual outcome of an experimental gamble was presented. EU displayed more activation compared to both control groups when there was a high probability of winning. The study at hand supports the hypothesis that neuronal activation patterns might even differ between drug users and healthy controls when no behavioral deficits are apparent. In EU, the probability of the occurrence of an event has more influence on neuronal activation than on the actual magnitude of reinforcing properties of this event. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

      "Abstract: This study utilizes a dominant-bank model to investigate whether an increase in retail loan and deposit-market concentration increases the incentives for both dominant and fringe banks to monitor their loans and thereby improve the quality of their loan portfolios. It shows that the effects on banks' incentives to engage in monitoring aimed at eliminating loan default losses in response to increased concentration of retail market shares of loans and deposits depend critically on whether the banks' asset and liability choices are interdependent. When the asset and liability decisions of both dominant and fringe banks are independent, a shift in market shares in favor of the dominant bank generates a straightforward increase in the incentives of all banks to monitor their loans. Under portfolio interdependence, the effects on monitoring outcomes at dominant banks and at banks within the competitive fringe depend on more complicated configurations of parameters. This fact helps explain mixed empirical evidence on the relationships between bank competition and measures of bank risk and soundness. © 2013 Scottish Economic Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, we present new evidence for the effect of changes in annuity prices on the decision to annuitize. We exploit an unprecedented change in policy in several Swiss occupational pension plans. There is an implied 8 percent reduction in the rate at which retirement capital is translated into an annuity, and this represents a net present value loss of CHF 18,500 (around US$ 20,000). To estimate the impact of this change, we use data from companies that changed their prices and from one large company that did not. We find that the price change reduces the propensity to annuitize among affected individuals by 16.8 percentage points. © The editors of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many real-life decisions in complex and changing environments are guided by the decision maker's beliefs, such as her perceived control over decision outcomes (i.e., agency), leading to phenomena like the \"illusion of control\". However, the neural mechanisms underlying the \"agency\" effect on belief-based decisions are not well understood. Using functional imaging and a card guessing game, we revealed that the agency manipulation (i.e., either asking the subjects (SG) or the computer (CG) to guess the location of the winning card) not only affected the size of subjects' bets, but also their \"world model\" regarding the outcome dependency. Functional imaging results revealed that the decision-related activation in the lateral and medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) was significantly modulated by agency and previous outcome. Specifically, these PFC regions showed stronger activation when subjects made decisions after losses than after wins under the CG condition, but the pattern was reversed under the SG condition. Furthermore, subjects with high external attribution of negative events were more affected by agency at the behavioral and neural levels. These results suggest that the prefrontal decision-making system can be modulated by abstract beliefs, and are thus vulnerable to factors such as false agency and attribution. © 2013 Xue et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: Productivity losses usually have a considerable impact on cost-effectiveness estimates while their estimated values are often relatively uncertain. Therefore, parameters related to these indirect costs play a role in setting priorities for future research from a societal perspective. Until now, however, value of information analyses have usually applied a health care perspective for economic evaluations. Hence, the effect of productivity losses has rarely been investigated in such analyses. The aim of the current study therefore was to investigate the effects of including or excluding productivity costs in value of information analyses. Methods: Expected value of information analysis (EVPI) was performed in cost-effectiveness evaluation of prevention from both societal and health care perspectives, to give us the opportunity to compare different perspectives. Priorities for future research were determined by partial EVPI. The program to prevent major depression in patients with subthreshold depression was opportunistic screening followed by minimal contact psychotherapy. Results: The EVPI indicated that regardless of perspective, further research is potentially worthwhile. Partial EVPI results underlined the importance of productivity losses when a societal perspective was considered. Furthermore, priority setting for future research differed according to perspective. Conclusions: The results illustrated that advise for future research will differ for a health care versus a societal perspective and hence the value of information analysis should be adjusted to the perspective that is relevant for the decision makers involved. The outcomes underlined the need for carefully choosing the suitable perspective for the decision problem at hand. © 2013 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We examined the influence of self-regulatory focus on the anticipation of regret in the context of life decisions. Eager promotion-focused individuals consider different negative outcomes to be more relevant than do vigilant prevention-focused individuals (e.g., non-gains vs. losses). We proposed that the two regulatory foci would elicit more regret for different negative decision consequences and that these regrets would induce preferences for different options. In four studies, we found that promotion-focused selfregulation elicits more regret for absent positive aspects and the failure to realize ideal goals, whereas prevention-focused self-regulation elicits more regret for present negative aspects and the failure to fulfill ought goals. Further, we observed that prevention-relevant regret is related to a common conceptualization of regret associating regret with uncertainty and rumination about one's decisions. Promotion-relevant regret, instead, seems to represent a different type of regret-regret centering on missed positive outcomes and unfulfilled ideal goals-that has been neglected in previous research. Finally, we document that the two types of regret result in different choice behavior. © 2013 Guilford Publications, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: EU antitrust investigations involve a sequence of events which affect the investigated firm's market value. We model these relationships and estimate their impact on firms' share prices. On average, a surprise inspection reduces a firm's share price by 2.89%, an infringement decision reduces it by 3.57%. The Court judgments do not have a statistically significant effect. Overall, we find that the total effect of the antitrust action ranges from -3.03% to -4.55% of a firm's market value. Fines account for no more than 8.9% of this loss, and we conjecture that most of the loss is due to the cessation of illegal activities. © 2013 The Editorial Board of The Journal of Industrial Economics and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of this article is to improve our understanding of preferences in experienced-based choice. Positioned within the framework of naturalistic decision making, this article responds to the recent call to complement the examination of experience-based choice with studies of cognition in the \"wild.\" We document an exploratory field study that uses applied cognitive task analysis (ACTA) to examine financial day traders' preferences. Providing real-world examples, our study illustrates how day traders construct their understanding of gains relative to losses and emphasizes the relevance of prospect theory for understanding the asymmetry of human choice. The fourfold pattern of preferences as studied in the wild is risk seeking for medium- and highprobability gains, risk averse for small-probability gains, risk averse for small-probability losses, and risk averse for medium- and high-probability losses. Our results differ from the fourfold pattern of preferences exhibited by experience-based choice when studied in the laboratory. The implications of this work for prospect theory and the distinction between \"experience through learning\" and \"experience through professional training\" are discussed alongside the merits of the ACTA technique for professional expert domain-based knowledge elicitation.

      "Abstract: We consider a repeated newsvendor problem in which the decision maker (DM) does not have access to the underlying demand distribution. The goal of this paper is to characterize the implications of demand censoring on performance. To that end, we compare the benchmark setting in which the DM has access to demand observations to a setting in which the DM may only rely on sales data. We measure performance in terms of regret: the difference between the cumulative costs of a policy and the optimal cumulative costs with knowledge of the demand distribution. Through upper and lower bounds, we characterize the optimal magnitude of the worst-case regret for the two settings, enabling one to isolate the implications of demand censoring. In particular, the results imply that the exploration-exploitation trade-off introduced by demand censoring is fundamentally different in the continuous and discrete demand cases, and that active exploration plays a much stronger role in the latter case. We further establish that in the discrete demand case, the need for active exploration almost disappears as soon as a lost sales indicator (that records whether demand was censored or not) becomes available, in addition to the censored demand samples. © 2013 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present study aimed at investigating whether the way offers are framed in the Ultimatum Game (UG) affects behavioral and autonomic responses in men and women. The \"I give you\" and \"I take\" expressions were used as gain and loss frames, respectively. Skin conductance and heart rate were recorded as indices of autonomic activation in response to unfair, mid-value, and fair offers. Acceptance rates were higher in men than in women under the gain frame. Moreover, men showed higher acceptance rates under the gain than under the loss frame with mid-value offers, whereas women's choices were not affected by frame. On the physiological level, men produced differential autonomic response patterns during decision-making when offers were presented under gain and loss framing. The \"I take\" frame, by acting as a loss frame, elicited in men the characteristic defensive response pattern that is evoked by aversive stimulation, in which increases in skin conductance are coupled with increases in heart rate. On the other hand, the \"I give you\" frame, by acting as a gain frame, elicited in men increases in skin conductance associated with prevailing heart rate deceleratory responses, reflecting a state of enhanced attention and orienting. In contrast, women's autonomic reactivity was not affected by frame, consistent with behavioral results. Phasic changes in heart rate were crucial in revealing differential functional significance of skin conductance responses under different frames in men, thus questioning the assumption that this autonomic measure can be used as an index of negative emotional arousal in the UG. © 2013 Copyright International Union of Psychology Science.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Police decision making in rape cases is poorly understood, despite high levels of attrition for rape and sexual assault cases, with up to 75% lost at the investigation stage. A qualitative analysis was undertaken of the comments of 22 British detectives as they conducted a 'virtual investigation' of an allegation of attempted rape of an adult woman. Material was 'drip fed' to detectives in a simulation exercise, and officers were asked to express their thoughts as they processed each document in the 'investigation' to evaluate detective decision making. It was anticipated that this method would shed light both on the dynamic nature of detectives' thinking during an investigation and on variations in perception of the same material by different officers. It was found that the alleged rape victim was perceived primarily as a source of information to progress enquiries, with her welfare needs taking second place. Although some police officers revealed sceptical attitudes to rape allegations, the investigative approach that all took was professional and pragmatic, 'investigating' the report as true and focusing on corroborating the victim's account. The balance between the needs of the victim and the needs of the investigation is discussed, with implications for rape survivor support. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In 2011 England's career guidance profession lost its 'own' public service organisation and its former dedicated stream of public funding. The immediate causes lay in decisions by the government of the day, but this article revisits the profession's history to seek explanations for its later vulnerability. It is argued that decisions taken early in the profession's history, specifically its complete separation from adult employment services and basing claims to professional expertise almost wholly on occupational psychology, though maybe right at the time, were to have fateful consequences. The article proceeds to argue that career guidance will certainly survive its recent trauma, but the most likely outcome of the current 'reforms' - a market in career guidance services - will not create the kind of comprehensive education-to-work bridging service that was once intended and which is still needed. © 2013 Copyright 2013 The Author(s).

      "Abstract: This paper formally analyzes the biases related to self-reporting in hedge fund databases by matching the quarterly equity holdings of a complete list of 13F-filing hedge fund companies to the union of five major commercial databases of self-reporting hedge funds between 1980 and 2008. We find that funds initiate selfreporting after positive abnormal returns that do not persist into the reporting period. Termination of selfreporting is followed by both return deterioration and outflows from the funds. The propensity to self-report is consistent with the trade-offs between the benefits (e.g., access to prospective investors) and costs (e.g., partial loss of trading secrecy and flexibility in selective marketing). Finally, returns of self-reporting funds are higher than that of nonreporting funds using characteristic-based benchmarks. However, the difference is not significant using alternative choices of performance measures. © 2013 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research has shown that pathological gamblers show various cognitive distortions, especially in interpreting near losses. Using a modified blackjack task, we investigated the electrophysiological responses to near and full losses in problem gamblers and controls. We assessed the event-related brain potentials (ERPs) of 20 problem gamblers and 21 controls at two time points following negative game outcomes. We also studied the behavioral changes after near and full loss experiences. Between 270 and 320. ms following a loss, controls but not gamblers showed a differential ERP response to near and full losses suggesting that a near loss is evaluated more negatively than a full loss. However, between 430 and 480. ms after a loss, the ERPs of both, gamblers and controls, showed a differential response as a function of the type of loss. Both groups became more cautious in their subsequent gambling behavior following near loss. The present study revealed differences in the time course of processing negative feedback in problem gamblers and normal controls, which might be due to gamblers preoccupation with gains rather than with losses. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Consider the following basic model in economic safety analysis: a firm is willing to invest an amount x in safety measures to avoid an accident A which, in the case of occurrence, leads to a loss of size L. The probability of an accident is a function of x. The optimal value of x is determined by minimizing the expected costs. In the present paper we study this model (and an extended version of it) in an applied risk/safety management setting, which allows for imprecise probabilities for the accident probabilities. The imprecision reflects the fact that the knowledge basis for assigning the probabilities is poor and based on many assumptions, and also that there are different knowledge bases among relevant experts and stakeholders. The purpose of the paper is to present and discuss a set-up for the precise formulation of this type of problems and show how they can be solved. We demonstrate in the paper how an optimal investment level x can be determined under different sets of situations and conditions, including one where a tolerability limit is defined for the accident probability. The main conclusion of the paper is that the robust optimization methods could in practice provide useful decision support but should be supplemented with sensitivity analyses showing the optimal investment levels for various parameter values followed by qualitative analyses providing arguments supporting the different parameter values. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

The article demonstrates that the number of activities in a risky prospect is a key consideration in selecting the risky prospect. As a result, the maximum expected profit criterion, widely used for making risk decisions, is fundamentally flawed, because it does not consider the impact of the number of risk-reward activities in the risky prospects. A popular view, that if a single risk-reward bet with positive expected profit is unacceptable then a sequence of such identical risk-reward bets is also unacceptable, has been analysed and proved incorrect. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

METHODS: Twenty self-identified, morbidly obese Mexican-American adolescent females and their families were interviewed about their food choices, personal and family barriers to weight loss, sources of support, previous weight-loss experience, and weight-related beliefs. Qualitative responses were coded by using framework analysis. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the adolescent and family responses: the impact of normal adolescent development, multiple sources of excess calories, the physical and emotional burden of excess weight for the adolescent, and the magnitude of the family's personal struggle with weight management. Multiple subthemes were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Responses by the adolescents and their families highlighted the intersection of adolescence and Mexican-American culture and the daily challenges of obesity.

Research suggests that the likelihood of litigation influences managers' stock trading decisions prior to material events. I hypothesize and find that insiders reduce their net stock sales in a monotonic manner before a new loss announcement presumably to avoid improper trading allegations before bad news. This decrease is more pronounced if the new loss is the start of a multiple loss sequence. In contrast, there is no significant change in net trading patterns in the quarters prior to a loss reversal announcement irrespective of whether the loss reversal is the start of a single profit or multiple profit sequence indicating that insiders seem less concerned about legal implications when trading before good news. The results suggest that insiders in loss firms perceive asymmetric litigation risks to trading stock in the quarters before bad news relative to good news and act accordingly. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Cost-benefit models of escape behaviour predict how close a prey allows a predator to approach [flight initiation distance (FID)] based on cost of not fleeing (predation risk) and cost of fleeing (loss of opportunities). Models for FID have been used with some success to predict distance fled (DF). We studied effects of foraging opportunity cost of fleeing and examined differences between age-sex groups in the omnivorous Balearic Lizard, Podarcis lilfordi. Balearic lizards forage on the ground for invertebrate prey and climb the thistle Carlina corymbosa to forage on its inflorescences. We studied escape behaviour in three experimental groups, with human beings as simulated predators: lizard foraging above ground on C. corymbosa, foraging on the ground away from thistles and on the ground with cut inflorescences. Flight initiation distance was shorter for lizards with cut inflorescences than for (1) lizards above ground due to the greater risk above ground due to conspicuousness of black lizards on yellow flowers; and (2) lizards on ground away from flowers due to the cost of leaving while feeding. The only age-sex difference was slightly greater FID for adult males than subadults, presumably because larger adult males are more likely to be attacked by predators. Other potential factors affecting this difference are discussed. Experimental group and age-sex group did not interact for FID or DF. Because lizards foraging on inflorescences above ground fled to the base of the plants to refuge provided by spiny thistle leaves, their DF was shorter than in the other groups, which fled across the ground, usually without entering refuge. DF did not differ between groups on the ground or among age-sex groups. The predicted shorter DF for lizards with cut inflorescences than on ground without inflorescences did not occur. We hypothesize that the opportunity cost was small due to the abundance of blooming thistles and that DF may be less sensitive to opportunity cost than FID. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When people have different opinions in a group, they often adjust their own attitudes and behaviors to match the group opinion, known as social conformity. The affiliation account of normative conformity states that people conform to norms in order to 'fit in', whereas the accuracy account of informative conformity posits that the motive to learn from others produces herding. Here, we test another possibility that following the crowd reduces the experienced negative emotion when the group decision turns out to be a bad one. Using event related potential (ERP) combined with a novel group gambling task, we found that participants were more likely to choose the option that was predominately chosen by other players in previous trials, although there was little explicit normative pressure at the decision stage and group choices were not informative. When individuals' choices were different from others, the feedback related negativity (FRN), an ERP component sensitive to losses and errors, was enhanced, suggesting that being independent is aversive. At the outcome stage, the losses minus wins FRN effect was significantly reduced following conformity choices than following independent choices. Analyses of the P300 revealed similar patterns both in the response and outcome period. Our study suggests that social conformity serves as an emotional buffer that protects individuals from experiencing strong negative emotion when the outcomes are bad. © 2013 Yu, Sun.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present study examined the role of parental rearing behavior in adolescents' risky decision-making and the brain's feedback processing mechanisms. Healthy adolescent participants (n = 110) completed the EMBU-C, a self-report questionnaire on perceived parental rearing behaviors between 2006 and 2008 (T1). Subsequently, after an average of 3.5 years, we assessed (a) risky decision-making during performance of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART); (b) event-related brain potentials (ERPs) elicited by positive (gain) and negative feedback (loss) during the BART; and (c) self-reported substance use behavior (T2). Age-corrected regression analyses showed that parental rejection at T1 accounted for a unique and significant proportion of the variance in risk-taking during the BART; the more adolescents perceived their parents as rejecting, the more risky decisions were made. Higher levels of perceived emotional warmth predicted increased P300 amplitudes in response to positive feedback at T2. Moreover, these larger P300 amplitudes (gain) significantly predicted risky decision-making during the BART. Parental rearing behaviors during childhood thus seem to be significant predictors of both behavioral and electrophysiological indices of risky decision-making in adolescence several years later. This is in keeping with the notion that environmental factors such as parental rearing are important in explaining adolescents' risk-taking propensities. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous studies of loss aversion in decisions under risk have led to mixed results. Losses appear to loom larger than gains in some settings, but not in others. The current paper clarifies these results by highlighting six experimental manipulations that tend to increase the likelihood of the behavior predicted by loss aversion. These manipulations include: (1) framing of the safe alternative as the status quo; (2) ensuring that the choice pattern predicted by loss aversion maximizes the probability of positive (rather than zero or negative) outcomes; (3) the use of high nominal (numerical) payoffs; (4) the use of high stakes; (5) the inclusion of highly attractive risky prospects that creates a contrast effect; and (6) the use of long experiments in which no feedback is provided and in which the computation of the expected values is difficult. In addition, the results suggest the possibility of learning in the absence of feedback: The tendency to select simple strategies, like \"maximize the worst outcome\" which implies \"loss aversion\", increases when this behavior is not costly. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. © 2013. The authors license this article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In both animal and human behavioral repertoires, classical expected utility theory is considered a fundamental element of decision making under conditions of uncertainty. This theory has been widely applied to problems of animal behavior and evolutionary game theory, as well as to human economic behavior. The Allais paradox hinges on the expression of avoidance of bankruptcy by humans, or death by starvation in animals. This paradox reveals that human behavioral patterns are often inconsistent with predictions under the classical expected utility theory as formulated by von Neumann and Morgenstern. None of the many attempts to reformulate utility theory has been entirely successful in resolving this paradox with rigorous logic. We present a simple, but novel approach to the theory of decision making, in which utility is dependent on current wealth, and in which losses are more heavily weighted than gains. Our approach resolves the Allais paradox in a manner that is consistent with how humans formulate decisions under uncertainty. Our results indicate that animals, including humans, are in principle risk-averse. Our restructuring of dynamic utility theory presents a basic optimization scheme for sequential or dynamic decisions in both animals and humans. © 2013 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The Iowa gambling task (IGT) is one of the most popular tasks used to study decisionmaking deficits in clinical populations. In order to decompose performance on the IGT in its constituent psychological processes, several cognitive models have been proposed (e.g., the Expectancy Valence (EV) and Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) models). Here we present a comparison of three models-the EV and PVL models, and a combination of these models (EV-PU)-based on the method of parameter space partitioning. This method allows us to assess the choice patterns predicted by the models across their entire parameter space. Our results show that the EV model is unable to account for a frequency-of-losses effect, whereas the PVL and EV-PU models are unable to account for a pronounced preference for the bad decks with many switches. All three models underrepresent pronounced choice patterns that are frequently seen in experiments. Overall, our results suggest that the search of an appropriate IGT model has not yet come to an end.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Social comparison can elicit emotions such as envy, which can affect social interactions. The emergence and development of such social emotions through ontogeny, and their influence on social interaction, are unknown. We tested 182 children from 7 to 13. years of age with a novel monetary reward-and-punishment task measuring envy and Schadenfreude (i.e., gloating or taking delight in someone else's misfortune). Children were either rewarded or punished in a trial-by-trial evaluation of their performance on a speeded reaction time task. In a social condition, feedback of their own and a competitor's performance was given for each trial. Afterward, children rated how they felt about the outcome. The ratings suggest that when children won, they felt better if the competitor lost instead of winning (i.e., Schadenfreude). Conversely, when children lost, they felt worse if the competitor won instead of losing (i.e., envy). Crucially, levels of envy and Schadenfreude decreased with age. We also studied how these emotions relate to social decisions made separately during three resource allocation paradigms. In each, children chose between two options that differed in the distribution of valuable tokens between themselves and an anonymous other. The combination of choices allowed the measurement of inequity aversion (i.e., equality for all) and spite (i.e., self-profit to maximal disadvantage of the other). We found an age-related increase in inequity aversion and decrease in spite. Crucially, age-related changes in both envy and Schadenfreude predicted the developmental change in equity-related decisions. These findings shed light on the development of social emotions and demonstrate their importance in the development of prosocial behavior in children. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Older people in the need of care are expected to live at home for as long as possible. Design. A qualitative and life world approach was used. Methods. Audio-taped interviews were conducted with twelve older persons living at home, dependent on daily municipal home help service. A phenomenological hermeneutic method was utilised to disclose the meanings of lived experiences. Finding. The findings revealed three themes: being facilitated to make one's own decisions, being hindered from making one's own decisions, struggling for vs. resigning oneself to losing the opportunity to make one's own decisions. The comprehensive understanding revealed that as older people become more dependent on caregivers' help, their opportunity to self-determine is challenged and this is stressful for them. Conclusion. The older persons assess their opportunity to self-determine differently, depending on who they are as a person. The caregivers need an awareness of this, and further research is needed to gain knowledge and understanding of how caregivers can improve the way they support and enhance older people's opportunity to decide for themselves. Implications for practice. The findings revealed older persons need to exercise more self-determination and caregivers' need for knowledge to enable this. Further, it indicates a move towards a person-centred approach to focus on persons as individuals and see them as interdependent. The findings contribute to improvements in similar contexts worldwide. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Pigeons prefer a risky option with a low probability of a high payoff over a less risky option that results in more food. This finding is analogous to suboptimal human monetary gambling because in both cases there appears to be an overemphasis of the occurrence of the winning event and an underemphasis of the losing event. In the present research, we found that pigeons that were exposed to an enriched environment (a large cage with three other pigeons for 4 h a day) were less likely to show this suboptimal choice behavior compared with typically housed laboratory pigeons in a control group. These results have implications for the mechanisms underlying suboptimal choice by humans (e. g., problem gamblers), and they suggest that a enriched environment may allow for enhanced self-control. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Neural representations of the effort deployed in performing actions, and the valence of the outcomes they yield, form the foundation of action choice. To discover whether brain areas represent effort and outcome valence together or if they represent one but not the other, we examined these variables in an explicitly orthogonal way. We did this by asking human subjects to exert one of two levels of effort to improve their chances of either winning or avoiding the loss of money. Subjects responded faster both when exerting greater effort and when exerting effort in anticipation of winning money. Using fMRI, we inspected BOLD responses during anticipation (before any action was executed) and when the outcome was delivered. In this way, we indexed BOLD signals associated with an anticipated need to exert effort and its affective consequences, as well as the effect of executed effort on the representation of outcomes. Anterior cingulate cortex and dorsal striatum (dorsal putamen) signaled the anticipation of effort independently of the prospect of winning or losing. Activity in ventral striatum (ventral putamen) was greater for better-than-expected outcomes compared with worse-than-expected outcomes, an effect attenuated in the context of having exerted greater effort. Our findings provide evidence that neural representations of anticipated actions are sensitive to the expected demands, but not to the expected value of their consequence, whereas representations of outcome value are discounted by exertion, commensurate with an integration of cost and benefit so as to approximate net value. © 2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An inability to adjust choice preferences in response to changes in reward value may underlie key symptoms of many psychiatric disorders, including chemical and behavioral addictions. We developed the rat gambling task (rGT) to investigate the neurobiology underlying complex decision-making processes. As in the Iowa Gambling task, the optimal strategy is to avoid choosing larger, riskier rewards and to instead favor options associated with smaller rewards but less loss and, ultimately, greater long-term gain. Given the demonstrated importance of the orbitofrontal cortex(OFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA)in acquisition of the rGTand Iowa Gambling task, we used a contralateral disconnection lesion procedure to assess whether functional connectivity between these regions is necessary for optimal decision-making. Disrupting the OFC-BLA pathway retarded acquisition of the rGT. Devaluing the reinforcer by inducing sensory-specific satiety altered decision-making in control groups. In contrast, disconnected rats did not update their choice preference following reward devaluation, either when the devalued reward was still delivered or when animals needed to rely on stored representations of reward value (i.e., during extinction). However, all rats exhibited decreased premature responding and slower response latencies after satiety manipulations. Hence, disconnecting the OFC and BLA did not affect general behavioral changes caused by reduced motivation, but instead prevented alterations in the value of a specific reward from contributing appropriately to cost-benefit decision-making. These results highlight the role of the OFC-BLA pathway in the decision-making process and suggest that communication between these areas is vital for the appropriate assessment of reward value to influence choice. © 2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Success in many decision-making scenarios depends on the ability to maximize gains and minimize losses. Even if anagent knows which cues lead to gains and which lead to losses, that agent could still make choices yielding suboptimal rewards. Here, by analyzing event-related potentials (ERPs) recorded in humans during a probabilistic gambling task, we show that individuals' behavioral tendencies to maximize gains and to minimize losses are associated with their ERP responses to the receipt of those gains and losses, respectively. We focused our analyses on ERP signals that predict behavioral adjustment: the frontocentral feedback-related negativity (FRN) and two P300 (P3) subcomponents, the frontocentral P3a and the parietal P3b. We found that, across participants, gain maximization was predicted by differences in amplitude of the P3b for suboptimal versus optimal gains (i.e., P3b amplitude difference between the least good and the best gains). Conversely, loss minimization was predicted by differences in the P3b amplitude to suboptimal versus optimal losses (i.e., difference between the worst and the least bad losses). Finally, we observed that the P3a and P3b, but not the FRN, predicted behavioral adjustment on subsequent trials, suggesting a specific adaptive mechanism by which prior experience may alter ensuing behavior. These findings indicate that individual differences in gain maximization and loss minimization are linked to individual differences in rapid neural responses to monetary outcomes. © 2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We study an optimal timing decision problem where an agent endowed with a risky investment opportunity trades the benefits of waiting for additional information against a potential loss in first-mover advantage. The players' clocks are de-synchronized in that they learn of the investment opportunity at different times. Thus, the model captures situations where players are heterogeneous with respect to the amount of information that they possess at any instant. In this framework, previous literature has uncovered an inverted-U shaped relationship between a player's equilibrium expected expenditures and the measure of his competitors. This result no longer holds when the increase in the measure of players leads to a decrease in the degree of clock synchronization in the game. We show that the result reemerges if information arrives only at discrete times, and thus, a player's strategic beliefs are updated between decision times in a measurably meaningful way. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

To evaluate the hypotheses, a logit model was employed on a final sample of 2,019 small family firms. FindingsResults suggest that family influence and control and intra&hyphen;family transgenerational succession intentions are negatively related to the propensity to use incentives. Also, the interaction effects of family management and ownership reduce the propensity to use incentives. Originality&sol;valueThe paper&rsquo;s empirical findings imply that despite their potential economic benefits, family involvement reduces the probability that incentives will be offered to non&hyphen;family managers because such incentives are perceived to be inconsistent with the preservation of the family&rsquo;s socioemotional wealth. Also, choices that reflect a preference for socioemotional wealth may not only be a function of decision framing and loss aversion but also by the size of the economic pay&hyphen;offs that might be available. The findings suggest that non&hyphen;family managers in SME family firms may be affected by a family&rsquo;s preoccupation with its socioemotional endowments. Thus, the authors expect that this paper provides further avenues to explore the decisions about attaining non&hyphen;economic and economic goals and other strategic issues in family firms. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

Given the costs of failed relationships (e.g., personal distress, problems with work, lower well-being for children, lost opportunities to meet other partners), it is important to consider how individuals are approaching these decisions. The current study tested if more thoughtful and clear relationship decision-making processes would relate to individuals' levels of satisfaction with and dedication to their partners as well as their extradyadic involvements. In a sample of 252 men and women, the results showed that regardless of relationship status (i.e., dating, cohabiting, or married), those who reported more thoughtful decision-making processes also reported more dedication to their partners, higher satisfaction with the relationship, and fewer extradyadic involvements. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the significance of the work-to-retirement transition for academic staff from a life course perspective and the manner in which individuals have managed the transition. Design/methodology/approach: In total, 32 semi-structured interviews were conducted with academic staff from ten Universities in England. The data are analysed using matrix analysis. Findings: Marked differences in the experience of the work-to-retirement transition were found and five groups are identified which characterise the significance of retirement. Clean Breakers view retirement as a welcome release from work. Opportunists and Continuing Scholars use retirement to re-negotiate the employment relationship. The Reluctant consider retirement as a loss of a valued source of identity and the Avoiders are undecided about retirement plans. Research limitations/implications: The focus of the study is at the individual level. A more complete understanding of retirement decisions would encompass organisational approaches to retirement issues. Practical implications: There are practical implications for academics approaching retirement. Not all academics wish to continue to engage in academic work in retirement. For those who do, opportunities are predominantly available to staff with stronger social and professional capital. Continued engagement necessitates personal adaptability and tolerance to ambiguity. Staff who are planning their careers might build such factors into retirement planning. Social implications: Organisations need to rethink their responsibilities in managing retirement processes as they face an increasing variety of retirement expectations in the workforce. Given the unfolding de-institutionalisation of retirement, both individuals and organisations need to re-negotiate their respective roles. Originality/value: The paper characterises the diversity of modes of experiencing retirement by academic staff, highlighting differences between the groups. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Merger enforcement today relies on settlements more than litigation to resolve anticompetitive concerns. The impact of settlement policy on welfare and the proper goals of settlement policy are highly controversial. Some argue that gun-shy agencies settle for too little, while others argue that agencies use their power to delay to extract overreaching settlement terms, even when mergers are not welfare reducing. This Article uses decision theory to throw light on this controversy. The goal of this Article is to formulate and analyze agency merger enforcement and settlement commitment policies in the face of imperfect information, litigation costs, and delay risks by the merging parties, agencies, and the courts. The Article explains why limiting the goal of merger enforcement and agency settlement policy simply to avoid welfare harms, but nothing more, is flawed as a matter of both law and policy and would compromise deterrence. The decision-theoretic analysis distinguishes two types of agency commitment policies: a short-run optimal policy that focuses only the specific merger proposal being evaluated and a long-run optimal policy that takes into account effects on future mergers and deterrence goals. The short-run optimal policy may lead to some welfare-reducing settlements by a rationally gun-shy agency; settlement demands for weakly welfareenhancing merger proposals, what might be called \"exacting tribute and \"anti-deterrence \" effects by merging firms proposing some mergers with greater welfare harm in order to increase settlement bargaining leverage. In contrast, a disciplined long-run optimal policy would clear all welfareenhancing mergers as proposed; forgo negative welfare settlements despite the risk of losing in court, but instead demand settlements on welfarereducing merger proposals sufficient to lead to strict welfare increases (not just welfare neutrality), relative to no merger; and avoid anti-deterrence by demanding larger settlements for more harmful mergers. While these latter provisions might be controversial as a political matter, they support deterrence. Demanding only welfare-neutral settlements would lead to under-deterrence. Deterrence also would be improved if last-minute voluntary divestiture agreements were not treated as part of the merger agreement evaluated by the court, contrary to the approach taken in Arch Coal and other cases.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Conventional understanding in legal reform communities is that time and resources are best directed toward legal disputes that have the highest chance of success and that litigation is to be avoided if it is likely to establish or strengthen unfavorable precedent. Contrary to this accepted wisdom, this Essay analyzes the strategic decisions of litigation entrepreneurs who pursue litigation with the awareness that losing the case can provide substantial benefits. Unfavorable litigation outcomes can be uniquely salient and powerful in highlighting the misfortunes of individuals under prevailing law, while presenting a broader narrative about the current failure of the legal status quo. The resulting public backlash may slow down legislative trends and can even prompt legislative initiatives that reverse the unfavorable judicial decisions or induce broader reform. This analysis revises some conventional wisdom about litigation. First, while it is traditionally understood that legal reform activists must persuade courts to recognize unattended rights or to confirm new rights and activist positions, the analysis here suggests that social changes can be obtained in litigation without requiring the involvement of courts as policymakers. Moreover, passive courts and judicial deference in fact strengthen the mobilizing effect of litigation by clearly shifting the burden to legislators and their constituents. Second, the dynamics of successful defeat in litigation shed new light on the costs and benefits involved with litigation. In the proposed framework, a plaintiff's decision to litigate rests not simply on the probability of success but also on a tradeoff between the potential costs of a negative precedent and the political benefits obtained in defeat. Third, the mobilizing potential of adverse court decisions presents a fascinating conflict between the immediate interests of the actual plaintiff and of the litigation entrepreneur or intermediary that supports the litigation with an eye on the underlying long-term goals of a social cause. Finally, the potential benefits of adverse outcomes refute some of the criticisms about the limitations and downsides of pursuing social change through courts.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a decision support tool to assess the potential benefits and costs of new healthcare interventions. Methods: The Canadian Partnership Against Cancer (CPAC) commissioned the development of a Cancer Risk Management Model (CRMM)-a computer microsimulation model that simulates individual lives one at a time, from birth to death, taking account of Canadian demographic and labor force characteristics, risk factor exposures, and health histories. Information from all the simulated lives is combined to produce aggregate measures of health outcomes for the population or for particular subpopulations. Results: The CRMM can project the population health and economic impacts of cancer control programs in Canada and the impacts of major risk factors, cancer prevention, and screening programs and new cancer treatments on population health and costs to the healthcare system. It estimates both the direct costs of medical care, as well as lost earnings and impacts on tax revenues. The lung and colorectal modules are available through the CPAC Web site (www.cancerview.ca/cancerrriskmanagement) to registered users where structured scenarios can be explored for their projected impacts. Advanced users will be able to specify new scenarios or change existing modules by varying input parameters or by accessing open source code.

Participants made repeated choices between two options, one to wager game credits on a game that produced probabilistic gains and losses, and one to gain game credits with certainty. Choice was investigated across stake and no-stake conditions and condition order was counterbalanced across conditions. Risk taking was higher under stake than no-stake conditions, but only when stake conditions were experienced first. There was no effect on risk taking of the amount of the certain gain. Results are consistent with previous research showing that participant-stake procedures promote greater risk taking than procedures that allow participants to gamble with their own earnings, and also show that experience gambling with earned credits has an enduring effect on risk taking. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: A diagnosis of breast cancer is often accompanied by the fear of loss of previous body image and attractiveness. Hence, many patients opt for reconstructive surgery. This study evaluated the effects of different types of reconstructive surgery after mastectomy on the functional and psychological adjustment of patients. Methods: In a cohort study, patients, who had breast reconstruction after mastectomy by means of four different allogenic or autologues techniques between 1999-2006 were retrospectively interviewed in person or by telephone. The questions addressed complication rates, physical complaints, functional impairments, body image outcomes, sexuality and patient satisfaction. Results: Of 139 patients, 89 (64.7 %) completed the survey. 32 (35.9 %) patients experienced one or more postoperative complications like seroma, hematoma, infections or necrosis. 16 (20 %) and 13 (16 %) patients reported strong and moderate adverse effects on sexuality, respectively. 62 (70 %) patients indicated that they were actively included in the decision making process. Patient ratings of good or bad medical advice were associated with complication rates (p = 0.008). Patients, who evaluated their first preoperative counseling positively, reported higher consent rates when a re-reconstruction became necessary (p ≤ 0.001). Satisfaction with the functional outcome after reconstruction and satisfaction with the cosmetic result was highly correlated (p < 0.001). Conclusions: A significant association of patient satisfaction with postoperative complications and the decision for a re-reconstruction was demonstrated. Furthermore, our results emphasize the importance of detailed preoperative counseling for women's adjustment to reconstructive surgery. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Data on long-term outcomes of survivors of extra-ocular retinoblastoma are lacking. The authors sought to provide the first report characterizing long-term outcomes among survivors of extra-ocular retinoblastoma. Procedure: Retrospective analysis of long-term medical outcomes in 19 survivors of extra-ocular retinoblastoma treated between 1992 and 2009. Severity of outcomes was graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. All patients received intensive multimodality therapy for their extra-ocular disease after management of their primary intra-ocular disease, including conventional chemotherapy (n=19, 100%), radiotherapy (n=15, 69%), and/or high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant (n=17, 89%). Results: The median follow-up was 7.8 years from diagnosis of extra-ocular retinoblastoma (range 2-17.8 years). The most common long-term non-visual outcomes were hearing loss (n=15, 79%), short stature (n=7, 37%), and secondary malignancies [SMN] (n=6, 31%). Sixty-eight percent of survivors exhibited ≥2 non-visual long-term outcomes of any grade. Except short stature, which was not graded for severity, Grade 3-4 outcomes were limited to: ototoxicity (n=8; n=4 require hearing aids), SMNs (n=6), and unequal limb length (n=1). Five patients who developed SMNs carried a known RB1 mutation. SMNs developed at a median of 11.1 years after initial diagnosis; two patients died of their SMN. Long-term cardiac, pulmonary, hepatobiliary, or renal conditions were not identified in any survivors. Conclusion: Long-term outcomes are commonly seen in extra-ocular retinoblastoma survivors but the majority are mild-moderate in their severity. Longer comprehensive follow-up is needed to fully assess treatment-related outcomes but the information collected to date may affect management decisions for children with extra-ocular disease. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When asked to choose between immediate versus future gains, individuals tend to fast-track benefits and, congruently, they tend to delay costs. But, despite the everincreasing importance of the topic, few studies have investigated this behavior among senior citizens. The handful of studies that have been conducted have produced conflicting results and focused on gains as opposed to losses. These conflicting results may in part be due to demographic confounds and the inherent variability that comes with aging. Here, demographic confounds and variability due to aging were minimized by studying three groups: middle-aged, unimpaired older, and impaired older adults. Participants were asked to choose between soonersmaller and laterlarger monetary rewards and losses. Results indicated that impaired older adults discounted the future more than unimpaired older adults. Interestingly, middle-aged adults discounted future gains at a similar rate as impaired older adults, but discounted future losses less than impaired older adults (and similarly to unimpaired older adults). This may suggest that unimpaired older adults have developed a compensatory mechanism that leads to more cautious, patient choices. We discuss these results in the context of the neurobiology and neuropsychology of aging and decision-making. © 2013 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

Privatized firms experienced large negative abnormal returns prior to the announcement of going private transaction, particularly in those firms with weak corporate governance structure and a high level of related party transactions. The likelihood of a firm to go private is high in those poorly governed firms with large free cash flow.

      "Abstract: Background: Owing to the policy of extramuralization of care in most Western countries older people with severe mental illness have to rely more and more on informal caregivers for daily care. Caregivers themselves are often aged, and although caregiving implies an impact on daily life that exceeds the boundaries of usual informal care, the impact differs across caregivers. Some caregivers seem to suffer more than others, and the differences cannot be fully understood by factors currently known to exacerbate the burden of caregiving. In order to help caregivers reduce the impact of caregiving it is important to gain a deeper understanding of factors influencing the burden and its impact on the caregiver's life. With this in mind, the aim of the study is to explore and understand differences in the impact of long-term caregiving on the quality of life of caregivers who look after older adults with severe mental illness. Methods: A qualitative, associative, inductive strategy and continuous simultaneous coding were used to interpret the data of 19 semi-structured interviews. Results: We identified an underlying psychological factor \"perceived freedom of choice\" which explains the gross differences in impact, leading to a definition of two main types of caregivers. Depending on how people perceive freedom of choice to provide care, the consequences of caregiving can be characterized as a process of gain (type 1) or loss (type 2). Four influential factors deepen the impact of caregiving for the type 2 caregivers, and two subtypes are identified for this category. Consequences of caregiving are most readily seen in a deteriorating quality of the relationship with the care recipient and in the psychosocial well-being of the caregiver. Conclusions: The concept of freedom of choice adds to our understanding of the differences and explains the variation in impact on the caregivers' life. The type 1 caregiver generally experiences gain whereas type 2 generally experiences loss, which puts the latter group typically at risk of becoming overloaded. Whether people perceive that they have freedom of choice in caregiving is an important consideration in evaluating the type of intervention needed to support caregivers. © 2013 Zegwaard et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

There has been little research in Taiwan done on the psychosocial factors affecting those who decide to continue their CL/P pregnancy. Purpose: This study identified the principal psychosocial factors that affect expecting mothers who chose to continue their CL/P pregnancy to term. Methods: Purposive sampling recruited expecting mothers with CL/P-diagnosed fetuses. Recruiting took place between May 2000 and March 2002 at a tertiary referral hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Those who had decided to continue their pregnancy to term were asked to participate. Researchers obtained oral informed consent to be interviewed during the week following CL/P diagnosis. Interviews for each participant were completed within a 2-week period. All information was given to the interviewees in written and verbal forms before providing their written informed consent to participate. Results: The five major themes central to participant experiences included (1) loss of self-valueas a mother, (2) blaming the mother, (3) indecision about whether to continue the pregnancy, (4) anxiety triggered by insufficient information, and (5) burden of care and concerns about potential disadvantaged status. Conclusions: Significant psychological distress was identified among participants following their fetus' CL/P diagnosis. It was encouraging to learn that all participants told researchers in postpartum interviews that they did not regret the decision to take their child to term.

      "Abstract: The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994) is often used to assess decision-making deficits in clinical populations. The interpretation of the results hinges on 3 key assumptions: (a) healthy participants learn to prefer the good options over the bad options; (b) healthy participants show homogeneous choice behavior; and (c) healthy participants first explore the different options and then exploit the most profitable ones. Here we test these assumptions using 2 extensive literature reviews and analysis of 8 data sets. The results show that all 3 assumptions may be invalid; that is, (a) healthy participants often prefer decks with infrequent losses; (b) healthy participants show idiosyncratic choice behavior; and (c) healthy participants do not show a systematic decrease in the number of switches across trials. Our findings question the prevailing interpretation of IGT data and suggest that, in future applications of the IGT, key assumptions about performance of healthy participants warrant close scrutiny. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Chronic blood shortages in the U.S. would be alleviated by small increases, in percentage terms, of people donating blood. The current research investigated the effects of subtle changes in charity-seeking messages on the likelihood of people responses to a call for help. We predicted that \"avoid losses\" messages would lead to more helping behavior than \"promote gains\" messages would. Method: Two studies investigated the effects of message framing on helping intentions and behaviors. With the help and collaboration of the Red Cross, Study 1, a field experiment, directly assessed the effectiveness of a call for blood donations that was presented as either death-preventing (losses) or life-saving (gains), and as being of either more or less urgent need. With the help and collaboration of a local charity, Study 2, a lab experiment, assessed the effects of the gain-versus-loss framing of a donation-soliciting flyer on individuals' expectations of others' monetary donations as well their own volunteering behavior. Study 2 also assessed the effects of three emotional motivators - feelings of empathy, positive affect, and relational closeness. Result: Study 1 indicated that, on a college campus, describing blood donations as a way to \"prevent a death\" rather than \"save a life\" boosted the donation rate. Study 2 showed that framing a charity's appeals as helping people to avoid a loss led to larger expected donations, increased intentions to volunteer, and more helping behavior, independent of other emotional motivators. Conclusion: This research identifies and demonstrates a reliable and effective method for increasing important helping behaviors by providing charities with concrete ideas that can effectively increase helping behavior generally and potentially death-preventing behavior in particular. © 2013 Chou, Murnighan.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Numeracy or one's ability to appropriately process and use numerical information has been shown to be an important individual difference factor in decision making. The current study utilized a risky decision-making task (called the \"cups task\") in which choices are made to both earn and avoid losing hypothetical money. Critically, this design allowed investigators to examine numeracy-related differences in adaptive decision-making as measured by sensitivity to expected value (EV) differences over 54 paired-choice trials-some in which it was advantageous to take a risk and some in which it was not. Results showed that in an undergraduate sample of 114 individuals, the less numerate took more risks and were less sensitive to varying EV levels than the more numerate, especially when it was disadvantageous to take a risk and when the choice involved a potential loss (rather than a gain). These results are consistent with a dual processing account in which the more numerate are much better than the less numerate at extracting the precise affective \"gist\" of the numerical information, which is then used to determine the goodness or badness of a particular choice. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We usually have only limited knowledge about the economic consequences of land-use decisions, thus they are uncertain. We analyze the implications of this uncertainty on conservation payments (CP) to preserve wildlife-friendly shade coffee production in southwest Ecuador, when conversion to maize is the most profitable alternative. Our objective is twofold: First, we analyze the consequences of applying Stochastic Dominance (SD) to derive CP, an approach making only minimal assumptions about the preferences of farmers. Second, we investigate the effects of land-use diversification to reduce CP by allowing for shade coffee on part of a landholding, and maize production on what remains. CP derived by SD turned out to be at least twice the amount calculated by an alternative method which maximizes a concave utility function-US$ 166 to US$ 294 ha-1 year-1 instead of US$ 86 ha-1 year-1. Given this result, we doubt that the assumptions underlying SD are reasonable for farmers, who are known to be risk-averse. Allowing for land-use diversification has a significant impact on CP. The optimal portfolio share of shade coffee is 27 % and for maize 73 % for moderately risk-averse farmers-without any CP. A larger share of shade coffee is preferable for strongly risk-averse farmers-51 and 49 % maize. The amount of CP necessary to encourage the expansion of shade coffee to 75 % is US$ 40 ha-1 year-1 (for moderately risk-averse) and US$ 19 ha-1 year-1 (for strongly risk-averse farmers). Stimulating diversification may thus help to significantly reduce CP necessary to preserve less profitable agroforestry options. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospect theory is increasingly used to explain deviations from the traditional paradigm of rational agents. Empirical support for prospect theory comes mainly from laboratory experiments using student samples. It is obviously important to know whether and to what extent this support generalizes to more naturally occurring circumstances. This article explores this question and measures prospect theory for a sample of private bankers and fund managers. We obtained clear support for prospect theory. Our financial professionals behaved according to prospect theory and violated expected utility maximization. They were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses and their utility was concave for gains and (slightly) convex for losses. They were also averse to losses, but less so than commonly observed in laboratory studies and assumed in behavioral finance. A substantial minority focused on gains and largely ignored losses, behavior reminiscent of what caused the current financial crisis. © 2011 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Research on emotions suggests that auction outcomes may elicit an aversive \"frustration of losing\" as well as a rewarding \"joy of winning\" response. However, little is known about the intensity of these emotional reactions and how they relate to other factors in the auction process. In this article, we present an experiment in which subjects participated in a sequence of first-price sealed-bid auctions. The psychophysiological measures skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) were recorded as proxies for both the intensity and the valence of emotions. Our results show that the deceleratory responses in HR when losing an auction are stronger than when winning an auction. The drop in HR itself can be interpreted as a reaction to stimuli with negative emotional valence. Moreover, we found that winning an auction induces a stronger SCR compared with losing an auction. Interestingly, this effect even holds for different value classes and different amounts of payoffs. Moreover, we show that bidders' SCR amplitude increases in the relation to the amount of money at stake. However, we cannot make a definite determination as to whether the valuation or the potential nominal payoff triggers this effect. We conclude that psychophysiological methodologies are appropriate for the measurement of rewarding, as well as immediate aversive emotions in market decision making, and even allow identifying fined-grained emotional characteristics. © 2013 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Most evaluations of the economic impacts of invasive species are done post facto and concentrate on direct production loss caused. However, the effects of invasive species on non-market services such as biodiversity and landscapes can be considerable. A proactive approach of assessing the expected economic impact of invasive species prior to their occurrence may contribute to greater efficiency of policy makers. Here we used a stated preference method for a priori evaluating the willingness of the population to pay for different control programs of a new invasive bee species in Israel, the dwarf honey bee, Apis florea. We evaluated possible economic impacts of A. florea using two model plant species expected to be adversely affected by its invasion due to decreased pollination. The plants have no market value but they add aesthetic value to the open landscape. Using a mixed logit model we found that the mean willingness to pay (WTP) differed between the model plants, and increased with the extent of plant loss. Respondents differentiated between levels of damage to the plants and between control methods in their preferences for a specific program. Our results provide means for informed proactive decision making in preventing the continued invasion of the bee. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Cumulative prospect theory predicts that losses motivate behavior more than equal gains. Contingency management procedures effectively reduce drug use by placing incentives in direct competition with the drug taking behavior. Therefore, framing incentives as losses, rather than gains should decrease drug use to a greater extent, given equivalent incentives. We examined whether contingent vouchers described as either losses or gains differentially affected smoking abstinence rates. Over 5 consecutive days, participants could either gain $75 per day for verified abstinence or lose $75 per day (initial endowment = $375) for continuing to smoke. As a result, loss-framed participants were more likely to achieve at least one day of abstinence. There was a trend towards loss-framed participants reducing the amount smoked more than gain-framed participants. However, participants in the gain-framed group were more likely to maintain abstinence, once initiated. The results partially support cumulative prospect theory and suggest additional ways to initiate behavior change using incentives, outside of using larger magnitude incentives in contingency management procedures. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research indicates that management changes are important events for organizations, partly because they lead to reversals of poor prior decisions. An unanswered question is why replacing the manager seems to be necessary for reversing poor decisions. One explanation is that managers have an irrational behavioral aversion to admitting mistakes (loss aversion). We test this hypothesis with a research design that mitigates many of the measurement problems associated with investment decisions in traditional corporate settings, and that allows us to distinguish agency cost from loss aversion as explanations. Using Major League Baseball data, we find that new managers, compared to continuing managers, are more likely to divest low-performing players. Moreover, when the manager is new and the previous manager was responsible for acquiring a player who is underperforming, the likelihood of player divestiture is significantly higher relative to low performers acquired by earlier managers. Experience of the acquiring manager does not affect the likelihood that the manager retains a low performer, suggesting that it is loss aversion, and not career concerns, that motivates acquiring managers to retain low performers. The findings suggest that loss aversion plays a significant role in managerial decisions and managerial turnover. (JEL J6, L8, D8) © 2012 Western Economic Association International.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The tendency to give socially desirable rather than true statements of willingness to pay (WTP) is an often reported form of bias in contingent valuation surveys. While previous research on this bias has exclusively focused on the detection of mode effects, the present study directly assesses a respondent's motivation to state WTP in a socially desirable manner. This study tests the effect of three theoretical motivations for socially desirable responding on WTP responses: A general need for social approval, a perceived social norm calling for a high contribution and perceived lack of anonymity of the interview situation. Questions for the empirical assessment of these factors are developed.Results of a valuation study in Southwest China show differing and independent impacts of these factors. While there is no effect of perceived anonymity, need for social approval biases WTP responses upwards but does not influence the general decision to state a positive WTP. It also turns out that rather the fear of losing social status than the striving for higher social approval is the main driver of this bias. Respondents perceiving a social norm for high WTP are more likely to state a positive WTP, but the specific amount is not affected. © 2013 Elsevier B.V..\u001b[0m :\n",

Other specific reasons for not donating were as follows: wanting the body buried whole (8%), concerns about age and prior health (7%), and incompatibility with religion or culture (7%). Consenting families had different concerns: worries about delays (36%), the potential donors' age and health (25%), how the body might look for viewing (14%), the amount of paperwork (10%), for-profit status of beneficiaries (9%), international distribution (8%), and family disunity (8%). Registry-related refusals weighted against donations of tissues from registered donors amounted to a deficit of 92 potential donations.

Hence, coastal risk assessment is essential to identify the threats to the land and population, from cyclones. The risk assessment has been carried out in northern coast of Tamil Nadu, India, for the stretch from Kattivakkam to Kovalam. Risk is the probability of expected losses from a given hazard and it varies according to the vulnerability of the region. The risk assessment has been structured in four components, namely, Environmental Vulnerability, Social Vulnerability, Hazard Potential and Mitigation Capacity. The thematic layers and hazard maps are created using Satellite data and Geographic Information System. Coastal risk indices are generated for each component of risk using Analytic Hierarchy Process.

      "Abstract: The healthy functioning of ecosystems is fundamental to human wellbeing, but sustainable development policies have failed to reverse global decline in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Accepting loss of biodiversity as a tradeoff for socio-economic gains means that the global ecological deficit continues to grow, with attendant risks for human wellbeing. While impact assessment has become more effective at identifying potential impacts on biodiversity, it has generally retained a 'damage limitation' focus, rather than striving to sustain, or even enhance, important biodiversity and ecosystem services. This paper recommends changes in how biodiversity is addressed in impact assessment to avoid increasing the ecological deficit. It considers whether, and how, integration of biodiversity offsets, namely measurable conservation outcomes to compensate for significant residual loss of biodiversity, can achieve 'no net loss' outcomes for biodiversity. It also reviews some of the implementation challenges. These challenges include obtaining the information needed to assess impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services at appropriate spatial and temporal scales, and recognizing when impacts might be impossible to offset or compensate in practice, thus setting limits to tradeoffs. © 2013 Copyright IAIA.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Charitable organizations need to have an in-depth understanding of their donors in order to retain their donations and attract new donors. This is particularly the case when the relationship with the donor is expected to be sustained rather than a one-off donation. The purpose of this phenomenological study is to discover the essence of donors' experiences of joining a child sponsorship program. The central research question is: What does it mean to be a child sponsor? Design/methodology/approach: A phenomenological methodology was used to explore the experiences associated with charitable giving for individuals providing long-term financial support to disadvantaged children. Findings: An analysis of 84 significant statements from a series of in-depth interviews revealed that sponsors experience both gains and losses from sponsoring a child. Financial ability and peers are influential in motivating child sponsorship, but the decision to sponsor a child is often not shared with family members. Sponsors indicated that they want to establish a close relationship with their sponsored child and they tend to sponsor children whom they perceive as similar in some respect to themselves. Research limitations/implications: The study focused on existing sponsors and did not consider lapsers. Second, although interviewing was continued to the point of saturation, and although the sample size was relatively large for a phenomenological study, caution must be exercised when trying to extrapolate the findings to a broader population. Practical implications: Charities should take a proactive role in managing communication between beneficiaries and sponsors. It is particularly important for the beneficiaries to communicate with the sponsors so as to give the sponsor the feeling of sponsoring a friend/family member. Charities could encourage their current sponsors to actively share their happiness and satisfaction with their friends. Testimonials and referral programs wherein happy sponsors share their experiences with potential sponsors would probably be productive. Finally, charities should aim to match sponsors and beneficiaries, at least in terms of nationality. Originality/value: This is the first study to investigate long-term charitable giving using an interpretative framework. The findings extend understanding of the experiences underlying sustained charitable giving and will be useful for charitable organizations seeking to understand more about the experiences of sponsors. Consideration of the findings will help charities maintain long-term donor relationships and encourage more people to undertake long-term sponsorship commitments. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

In Study 2, men whose hair was digitally removed were perceived as more dominant, taller, and stronger than their authentic selves. Study 3 extends these results with nonphotographic stimuli and demonstrates how men experiencing natural hair loss may improve their interpersonal standing by shaving.

      "Abstract: Over time, accounting standards have moved toward presenting more items at fair value on the balance sheet. Consistent with this trend, IAS No. 36 permits an impairment loss on a long-lived asset to be reversed if the economic value of the asset recovers. This article uses empirical data from an experiment conducted with 118 managers to explore the implication of allowing impairment reversals on a manager's decision to record the loss. Results suggest that permitting reversals significantly increases the likelihood that a manager will record the impairment, especially if the manager has a bonus plan. The bonus plan effect is not caused by the manager's intention to smooth income through impairment reversals, but by his disutility from a bonus forgone if the value of the asset recovers but accounting rules prohibit him from reversing the loss. © CAAA/ACPC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Emotion regulation strategies can alter behavioral and physiological responses to emotional stimuli and the neural correlates of those responses in regions such as the amygdala or striatum. The current study investigates the brain systems engaged when using an emotion regulation technique during financial decisions. In decision making, regulating emotion with reappraisal-focused strategies that encourage taking a different perspective has been shown to reduce loss aversion as observed both in choices and in the relative arousal responses to actual loss and gain outcomes. In the current study, we find using fMRI that behavioral loss aversion correlates with amygdala activity in response to losses relative to gains. Success in regulating loss aversion also correlates with the reduction in amygdala responses to losses but not to gains. Furthermore, across both decisions and outcomes, we find the reappraisal strategy increases baseline activity in dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum. The similarity of the neural circuitry observed to that seen in emotion regulation, despite divergent tasks, serves as further evidence for a role of emotion in decision making, and for the power of reappraisal to change assessments of value and thereby choices.© The Author (2012).

      "Abstract: In equal employment cases concerning fair hiring or promotion, the number of eligible candidates often exceeds the number of available positions.When a group of plaintiffs showthat theywere discriminated against in the selection process, one cannot determine with certainty which ones would have been chosen. Several decisions from the Seventh Circuit observed that this situation is similar to the loss of chance in tort law where due to negligence the survival probability of a patient has been diminished. In both settings the plaintiffs' loss can be regarded as probabilistic, i.e., in the discrimination context they lost their chance of obtaining the job or promotion. This article shows how survival analysis provide statistically sound estimates of the compensation due to a plaintiff.At each time an employment decision is made, all eligible candidates are considered. Job related factors such as seniority or special skill can be incorporated in the estimates of the probability each candidate would be employed or promoted. These probabilities are used to weight the salary differentials to provide an estimate of the lost salary. The loss in accrued pension benefits is also weighted by probability of being promoted before retirement. The methodology is illustrated on data from the Alexander v. Milwaukee promotion discrimination case. The survival analysis also confirmed the original finding of liability as the chances of promotion of white males were statistically significantly lower. Because seniority was an important factor our estimates differ from those suggested in the opinion which followed the Biondo v. City of Chicago decision. That opinion assumed a plaintiff who ultimately received a promotion would have been promoted during the period of discrimination. This assumption is questionable when seniority has a role since an individual's seniority increases over time. © The Author [2012]. Published by Oxford University Press.

      "Abstract: Lack of self-awareness of one's decisions remains an understudied and elusive topic in the addiction literature. The present study aimed at taking a first step towards addressing this difficult subject through the use of a combination of behavioral procedures. Here, we explored the association between a metacognitive process (the ability to reflect and evaluate the awareness of one's own decision) and poor performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in a group of pathological gamblers (PG; n = 30), and in a comparison group (n = 35). This metacognitive process was assessed during the IGT with the post-decision wagering procedure, while a number of potential confounds (i. e., reward/loss sensitivity, dual-tasking) were controlled for. Results showed that: (1) Initial performance enhancement of the control group on IGT occurred without explicit knowledge of the task, thus confirming its implicit character; (2) compared to controls, performance of PG on the IGT failed to increase during the task; (3) taking into account increased reward sensitivity and decreased loss sensitivity as well as poorer dual-tasking in pathological gamblers, PG tended to exhibit a bias in evaluating their own performance on the IGT by maximizing their wagers independently of selecting advantageous decks. Our findings suggest that biased metacognition may affect pathological gamblers, leading to disadvantageous post-decision wagering, which is in turn linked to impaired decision making under ambiguity. Perhaps this deficit reflects the impaired insight and self-awareness that many addicts suffer from, thus providing a novel approach for capturing and measuring this impairment, and for investigating its possible causes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Given the pervasive evidence that people typically value changes in terms of comparisons to a reference state, and that they commonly value losses and reductions of losses more than gains, current risk assessment and valuation practice is likely to lead to systematic bias and distorted guidance. Willingness to pay estimates of the value of reducing the risk of harm are, for example, likely to understate the value of actions to bring this about. Differences in valuations resulting from different measures are illustrated, and the criteria for the choice between measures of the value of positive and negative changes in risk are demonstrated with results from a new risk study in China. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The current study focuses on the development and validation of the Decisional Balance Scale for Adolescent Offenders (DBS-AO). This measure was designed to systematically evaluate adolescent offenders' motivation to end or maintain their criminal behaviors, a critical yet missing component for most assessment measures and treatment programs focused on adolescent offenders. Method: Items based on the decisional balance theory were generated via focus groups and refined through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA) using 238 adolescent offenders from a maximum-security institution. Their results were compared to the stages of change and psychopathic characteristics. Results: The CFA demonstrated a good fit for a three-factor model. The first scale, Cons, assesses the negative consequences of ending criminal behavior (e.g., monetary loss). In contrast, the Pros-Self evaluates the positive consequences for offenders when they terminate criminal activities (e.g., improved self-respect). Finally, the Pros-Others considers the positive consequences experienced by significant others when offenders stop engaging in crime (e.g., increased safety). The DBS-AO three scales demonstrated good scale homogeneity and initial evidence of construct validity with the Stages of Change scale. Conclusions: The DBS-AO provides a theory-driven model for addressing motivational issues for adolescent-offender treatment, which is currently lacking in most interventions for adolescent offenders. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The main objective of this study is to simulate household choice behavior under varying climate change scenarios using choice experiments. Economic welfare measures are derived for society's willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce climate change induced flood risks through private insurance and willingness to accept compensation (WTAC) for controlled flooding under varying future risk exposure levels. Material flood damage and loss of life are covered in the insurance policy experiment, while the WTAC experiment also captures the economic value of immaterial flood damage such as feelings of discomfort, fear and social disruption. The results show that WTP and WTAC are substantial, suggesting a more prominent role of external social damage costs in cost-benefit analysis of climate change and flood mitigation policies. © 2012 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the system requirements model. According to the concept of loss costs of Type I and Type II errors, it can define the optimal decision line, and reduce overall loss costs. Moreover, it can decrease the probability of Type I and Type II error by the systems thinking, and it can effectively reduce overall loss costs. Design/methodology/ approach - The paper proposed a system demand model and constructed a decision-making system thinking model as well as a decision-making performance management model using the principle of system demand. Types of decision-making errors were analyzed to set judgments on the error risk and establish a model of improvement evaluation key factors, in order to reduce decision-making error risk and enhance decision quality. It also constructed the improved decision-making to assess the key factors, to reduce the risk of making errors in order to improve the quality of decision-making. Findings - Optimistic decision-makers (risk takers) tend to make Type II errors, whereas pessimistic decision makers (conservatives) tend to make Type I errors. Financial depressions are the time for optimistic decision makers (risk takers) and boom periods are the time for pessimistic decision makers (conservatives). Originality/value - The concept of the loss cost of two decision-making errors and related cost function models were proposed. Decision makers could make decisions with a more stable model, taking into consideration false alarms and the cost function of errors in order to determine the position of the decision-making line. It could effectively reduce decision-making error costs and increase the precision of decision-making. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Losses were found to improve cognitive performance, and this has been commonly explained by increased weighting of losses compared to gains (i.e., loss aversion). We examine whether effects of losses on performance could be modulated by two alternative processes: an attentional effect leading to increased sensitivity to task incentives; and a contrast-related effect. Empirical data from five studies show that losses improve performance even when the enhanced performance runs counter to the predictions of loss aversion. In Study 1-3 we show that in various settings, when an advantageous option produces large gains and small losses, participants select this alternative at a higher rate than when it does not produce losses. Consistent with the joint influence of attention and contrast-related processes, this effect is smaller when a disadvantageous alternative produces the losses. In Studies 4 and 5 we find a positive effect on performance even with no contrast effects (when a similar loss is added to all alternatives). These findings indicate that both attention and contrast-based processes are implicated in the effect of losses on performance, and that a positive effect of losses on performance is not tantamount to loss aversion. © 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study illustrates how the use of metaphor in business and economic news coverage shapes individuals' responsibility attributions in ways that can ultimately influence consumers' investment decisions. In a randomized experimental design, participants were invited to read news articles that described the bankruptcy of a business. The treatment text narrated the bankruptcy using metaphor, while the control text narrated the same event without the use of metaphor. After exposure to the communication text narrated with metaphor, responsibility attributions and subsequent investment decisions were significantly altered. The findings suggest that individual responsibility attributions, particularly when employed in connection with exposure to metaphorical loss frames, have the ability to influence individuals' economic decisions.

      "Abstract: The opportunity costs of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD. +) accruing to different stakeholders in Indonesia, including companies and the national, provincial and district level governments, are estimated, with particular emphasis on the influence of alternative discount rates. A cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of avoided deforestation is conducted. The three major land-use activities considered are commercial logging, timber and oil palm plantation. The opportunity cost of oil palm plantations on mineral soil preceded by logging of degraded forest is prohibitively high. REDD. + measures that impose restrictions on the development of those land-use activities would lead to a substantial loss of public revenues at the various government levels. The results of this study reveal that land-use management in Indonesia is rather centralistic, where the national government retains most of the revenues from land-use alternatives to REDD + To influence their behaviour towards land-use change, REDD. + schemes need to create a direct link between the distribution of public revenues and district governments' decisions on land-use activities in their localities. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Following weight loss surgery (WLS), patients are expected to make diet and lifestyle changes which may lead to children mimicking the changing behaviors of their parents. The purpose of the study was to identify the differences in diet and lifestyle behaviors between obese children with and without a parent who received WLS. Methods: Medical records of 45 children whose parents had undergone WLS and 90 age- and gender-matched control children were reviewed from a weight loss program in a large Midwest children's hospital. Differences in dietary choices and behaviors, perceived barriers, and sedentary behaviors were examined between both groups. Results: The mean age for the sample was 12.8 years. Children in the parental weight loss surgery (PWLS) group were more likely to eat two or more helpings of food at each sitting (p = 0.02) and less likely to play outdoors for more than an hour each day (p = 0.01). Compared to the control group, the PWLS group more frequently reported eating fast food on most days (45.2 vs. 27.0 %), soda consumption several times a week (48.6 vs. 29.4 %), and no vegetable intake (9.5 vs. 1.1 %). The top three barriers to exercise for both groups were lack of self-discipline, lack of interest, and lack of energy. Conclusions: Obese children who live with a parent that had undergone WLS reported several unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, in some cases worse than the children who live with parents who had not had WLS. Being cognizant of these findings will help obesity providers focus their counseling and expectations appropriately. © 2012 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

In two experiments, participants were instructed to make the \"same\" type of risk decisions repeatedly. Experiment 1 showed that when the information for decision is positively framed in terms of gain, the participant's choice in a particular decision could not be predicted by his or her choice in another decision (R2s<.02). Experiment 2 showed a statistically significant predictability when the information is negatively framed in terms of loss, although the predictability was still very low (R2s<.07).

      "Abstract: Even though video game players frequently report losing track of time while playing, few studies have addressed whether there are long-lasting effects of such activity on time perception. We compared the performance of chronic and occasional video game players in sub-and multi-second time perception tasks. Temporal Discrimination and Temporal Bisection tasks, in the range of 100 to 1,000 milliseconds, and Time estimation and Time production tasks, in the range of 5 to 60 seconds, were used to assess sub-and multi-second time perceptions, respectively. Chronic video game players performed significantly better than occasional players on sub-second tasks, but no group difference was found for the multi-second tasks used. Sub-and multi-second time perceptions are associated to different underlying systems: automatic and cognitive controlled for sub-and multi-second tasks, respectively. We argue that video game use seems to induce more efficient implicit, rather than cognitive controlled, processing of time. © 2013, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Only very recently has research demonstrated that experimentally induced emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression) affect risky choice (e.g., Heilman et al., 2010). However, it is unknown whether this effect also operates via habitual use of emotion regulation strategies in risky choice involving deliberative decision making. We investigated the role of habitual use of emotion regulation strategies in risky choice using the \"cold\" deliberative version of the Columbia Card Task (CCT; Figner et al., 2009). Fifty-three participants completed the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ; Gross & John, 2003) and-one month later-the CCT and the PANAS. Greater habitual cognitive reappraisal use was related to increased risk taking, accompanied by decreased sensitivity to changes in probability and loss amount. Greater habitual expressive suppression use was related to decreased risk taking. The results show that habitual use of reappraisal and suppression strategies predict risk taking when decisions involve predominantly cognitive-deliberative processes. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A variety of studies have been conducted to assess the impact of farmland preservation policies in China. Most of these studies focus on the use of pure statistical approaches to assess the policy impact. A spatially explicit modeling framework is, however, often required to better assess the policy impact and to help understand the consequence of these policies. In this article, we developed such a spatially explicit modeling framework to assess the impact of policies on arable land loss and urban sprawl through the combination of counterfactual analysis with a scenario simulation approach. Counterfactual analysis provides support to assess the impact of farmland preservation policies, while scenario simulation enables us to generate counterfactual outcomes to capture possible land use patterns without policy intervention. With support from cellular automata, farmland preservation policies are integrated into the decision-making processes of land use conversion to link policy with scenario simulation. Our case study demonstrates the potential of the proposed modeling framework for the assessment of farmland preservation policies. Experimental results indicate that farmland preservation policies play an important role in terms of reducing the rate of arable land loss and governing spontaneous urban sprawl. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

However, they suffer from (a) initial reluctance of subjects to join the punishment institution and (b) initial efficiency losses due to frequent punishment. We investigate experimentally the effects of social learning on the acceptance and the efficiency of a peer punishment mechanism in an institution choice experiment. Providing participants with a social history - presenting the main results of an identical previous experiment conducted with different subjects - decreases the initial reluctance towards the punishment institution significantly. With social history, cooperative groups reach the social optimum more rapidly and there is lower efficiency loss due to reduced punishment. Our findings shed light on the importance of social learning for the acceptance of seemingly unpopular but socially desirable mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research has shown that personality characteristics, such as sensation seeking (SS), are strong predictors of risk-taking behavior during adolescence. However, the relationship between levels of SS and brain response has not been studied during this time period. Given the prevalence of risky behavior during adolescence, it is important to understand neurobiological differences in reward sensitivity between youth with high and low SS personalities. To this end, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine differences in brain activity in an adolescent sample that included 27 high (HSS) and 27 low sensation seekers (LSS), defined by the Impulsive Sensation Seeking scale of the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (Zuckerman et al., 1993). In the scanner, participants played a modified Wheel of Fortune decision-making task (Cservenka and Nagel, 2012) that resulted in trials with monetary Wins or No Wins. We compared age- and sex-matched adolescent HSS and LSS (mean age = 13.94 ± 1.05) on brain activity by contrasting Win vs. No Win trials. Our findings indicate that HSS show greater bilateral insular and prefrontal cortex (PFC) brain response on Win vs. No Win compared to LSS. Analysis of simple effects showed that while LSS showed comparable brain activity in these areas during Wins and No Wins, HSS showed significant differences in brain response to winning (activation) vs. not winning (deactivation), with between-group comparison suggesting significant differences in brain response, largely to reward absence. Group differences in insular activation between reward receipt and absence may suggest weak autonomic arousal to negative outcomes in HSS compared with LSS. Additionally, since the PFC is important for goal-directed behavior and attention, the current results may reflect that HSS allocate fewer attentional resources to negative outcomes than LSS. This insensitivity to reward absence in HSS may lead to a greater likelihood of maladaptive choices when negative consequences are not considered, and may be an early neural marker of decreased loss sensitivity that has been seen in addiction. This neurobiological information may ultimately be helpful in establishing prevention strategies aimed at reducing youth risk-taking and suggests value in further examination of neural associations with personality characteristics during adolescence. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Our results confirm that the limitation of inequity between subjects' payments implies lower effort while the elimination of losses relative to expectations decreases the variance of effort. They suggest that envy and loss aversion drive behavior in tournaments.

      "Abstract: As with standard models of rationality, theorists generally treat prospect theory's demonstration of risk aversion in gains but risk tolerance in losses as domain-general. Yet evolutionary psychology suggests that natural selection has designed a domain specific cognitive architecture-with systems specialized for some substantive domains but not others. Here we address risky choices through that lens asking whether humans' risk responses dispose them to enter social relationships even when doing so is counter to normative rationality and regardless of whether the \"enter\" versus \"not enter\" choice is framed as between gains and losses. Laboratory findings in five sites across three countries provide a positive answer to both possibilities. Participants could enter or not enter inherently risky social relationships. They were more willing to enter such relationships than rational choice models would predict and were equally so willing regardless of whether equivalent alternatives were framed as gains and as losses. With the \"social context\" extracted in otherwise identical games, participants' risk responses were consistent with prospect theory. The present findings suggest the possibility of adaptations designed to facilitate sociality-despite its risks and how those risks are framed. © 2012 International Society of Political Psychology.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: The future of psychotherapy research lies in the development of easy-touse, efficient treatments that target specific characteristics and needs of patients with a given disorder. Meeting this aim will involve understanding why people seek psychotherapy and the therapeutic features that they feel are most helpful in their recovery. Identifying key features of treatment that patients feel lead to improvement may help identify the active ingredients of psychotherapy and further refine treatment. Design: We selected 22 older adults who participated in a larger randomized trial of psychotherapy for late-life depression to participate in individual, semistructured qualitative interviews. Setting: Interviews took place at the University of California, San Francisco or in the participant's home. Participants: All participants were age 60 years or older with major depression and co-occurring executive dysfunction. Measurements: Participants were asked about their depression experience, their expectations for treatment, most and least helpful aspects of treatment, effects of treatment, and recommended improvements to treatment. Data were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using NVivo (QSR International, Cambridge, MA). Results: The most commonly noted causes for seeking treatment were depression related to interpersonal relationships, health conditions, grief/loss, finances, housing, and challenges due to executive dysfunction. Participants had few expectations about treatment and they found support, the problem-solving therapy process, and focus on interpersonal relationships to be the most helpful processes in treatment. Conclusion: Suggestions for psychotherapy include increasing the number of sessions, discussing problems in a more proactive way, and considering participant choice in treatment.

      "Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to propose a complete theory of grey conflict analysis model based on grey game and the graph model for conflict resolution and also, to illustrate a case of “prisoner's dilemma” in the traditional grey game as an example. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the theories of grey game and graph model for conflict resolution, this paper concentrates on the model of grey conflict analysis in a case of two players under the condition of symmetrical loss information. By analyzing decision makers, strategies, states, graph model and grey potential, and the number of decision makers' steps, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is extended to grey potential‐general metarationality, grey potential‐symmetrical metarationality, and grey potential‐sequential stability. Meanwhile, the logical relationships between solutions are discussed. A specific case study is carried out to illustrate how the proposed grey conflict analysis model is used in practice. Findings: The results in this paper indicate that more stable solutions are found when one considers the grey potential‐general metarationality, the grey potential‐symmetrical metarationality, and the grey potential‐sequential stability, and then solve the paradox of “prisoner's dilemma”. Practical implications: This new grey conflict analysis model could be used to provide useful information for policy makers during existing conflicts or negotiations among parties or enterprises. Originality/value: The paper succeeds in constructing a new grey conflict analysis model, in which the solution concepts are studied; and the two‐player grey game will be extended to n‐players in the near future. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

The safety net game is compared to both an individual decision task involving full liability and the deterministic public goods game. We report experimental data to show that limited liability leads to higher risk taking in comparison to full liability; nevertheless, the difference is much smaller than predicted by theory. In the safety net game, subjects behave as if socially responsible for the losses they impose on the group. With repetition, nevertheless, a gradual emergence of the moral hazard problem arises.

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Individuals living with HIV face challenging employment decisions that have personal, financial, and health impacts. The decision to stay or to leave the work force is much more complicated for an individual with HIV because the financial choices related to potential health benefits are not clearly understood. To assist in the decision-making process for an individual with HIV, we propose to develop a decision model that compares the potential costs and benefits of staying in or leaving the work force. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of HIV-infected individuals was simulated in our decision model. Characteristics of these individuals over a one-year period were extracted from the medical literature and publicly available national surveys. Men and women between the ages of 18 and 59 were included in our simulated cohort. METHODS: A decision tree model was created to estimate the financial impact of an individual’s decision on employment. The outcomes were presented as the cost-savings associated with the following employment statuses over a one-year period: 1) staying full-time, 2) switching from full-to part-time, 3) transitioning from full-time to unemployment, and 4) staying unemployed. CD4 T cell counts and employment statuses were stratified by earned income. Employment probabilities were calculated from national databases on employment trends in the United States. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the effects of the variables on the outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, the decision outcome that resulted in the least financial loss for individuals with HIV was to remain at work. For an individual with CD4 T cell count > 350, the cost difference between staying employed full-time and switching from full-time to part-time status was a maximum of $2,970. For an individual with a CD4 T cell count between 200 and 350, the cost difference was as low as $126 and as great as $2,492. For an individual with a CD4 T cell count < 200, the minimum cost difference was $375 and the maximum cost difference was $2,253. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our simulated model, we recommend an individual with CD4 T cell count > 350 to stay employed full-time because it resulted in the least financial loss. On the other hand, for an individual with a CD4 T cell < 350, the financial cost loss was much more variable. Our model provides an objective decision-making guide for individuals with HIV to weigh the costs and benefits of employment decisions. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

      "Abstract: Purpose-The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the gender composition of a fund management team influences investment decision-making behavior. Specifically, we focus on how portfolio choice is affected by team risk aversion and loss aversion. Design/methodology/approach-Using an experimental economics approach, the paper examines the relationship between gender diversity and investment decisions. Teams of four persons each were given the task of making investment portfolio management decisions. Findings-The paper finds that team composition does influence financial decisions with regard to the assessment of risk and loss. The paper finds evidence that a male presence increases the probability of selecting a higher risk investment. However, the all male teams are not the most risk seeking. Moreover, having a male presence can increase loss aversion. Originality/value-In the context of workforce composition, these results could have important implications for team investment decisions driven by the assessment of risk and return tradeoffs. To curb excessive risk taking and loss aversion, the findings would suggest that understanding the role of gender diversity in risk management would be useful in effecting change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In a macroeconomic framework, I quantitatively evaluate the theory of Loss Aversion/Narrow Framing (LANF) as a resolution to the Equity Premium Puzzle (EPP). The EPP is where the neoclassical asset pricing model cannot be reconciled with the empirical fact that stocks have much higher returns than risk-free assets. The prior predictive analysis employed follows a Bayesian approach that draws realizations for preferences that describe the degree of LANF characterizing consumer's tastes. The analysis is also extended along two more dimensions: the variance of aggregate uncertainty and the elasticity of labor. The priors used are carefully defined from previous works in the literature. This Monte Carlo procedure finds that the theory is unable to jointly describe the equity premium and labor's elasticity of supply. That is, only when the labor supply elasticity is unreasonably low can LANF preferences generate any equity premiums. Alternatively, when the elasticity is more realistically high, LANF preferences fail to generate significant premiums. My analysis therefore concludes that a resolution to the EPP via a theory of LANF must be modified along the description of labor's choices. As ancillary result, the hybrid perturbation-projection method developed for this experiment is shown to be a robust technique. © 2013 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.\u001b[0m :\n",

The concepts measuring the price of a human life are analyzed: the evaluation from the standpoint of the theory of human capital; indirect estimation taking into account non-monetary social costs; evaluation of individuals' willingness to pay for the elimination of the risk of death; estimation based on the determination of insurance premiums and compensations under court decision; evaluation of the social investments, aimed to reduce the risk of premature mortality of the individual. The following indexes were calculated for all subordinate entities of the Russian Federation: reduction of life expectancy, lost years of potential life in the working age, and gross regional product lost due to the reduction of years of potential life in the working-age population as a result of cancer.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Inputs are provided for the decision-making process of transit improvements in developing countries. With an analysis of the willingness of private bus operators to participate in transit improvements, political feasibility can be assessed, and the likelihood of successful implementation can be increased. Data from 156 surveys conducted in cities in Mexico are used to develop probabilistic models that quantify the influence of private bus operators' characteristics, perceptions about business and operating efficiencies, and their relationship with government on their willingness to participate. Evidence shows that several elements can increase the willingness of private operators to participate in government-led proposals. These elements include the level of trust and communication between private bus operators and government authorities, the economic power of private bus operators, and the attachment to the status quo. Several features are shown to limit operators' willingness to participate, including the model of operation, likelihood of lost revenue through taxation, and concerns about the potential modifications of their legal rights to operate. An analysis of Mexico City, Mexico, and surrounding areas demonstrates the need to establish a well-defined strategy for engaging private bus operators in transit improvements; failure to do so has resulted in much less trust of government and led to more conflicts about future projects. The importance of analyzing private bus operators' participative profiles in the assessment of transit improvements is revealed. Selected areas for improvements might present challenges for engaging private bus operators in proposed improvements.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In human adults, judgment errors are known to often lead to irrational decision-making in risky contexts. While these errors can affect the accuracy of profit evaluation, they may have once enhanced survival in dangerous contexts following a \"better be safe than sorry\" rule of thumb. Such a rule can be critical for children, and it could develop early on. Here, we investigated the rationality of choices and the possible occurrence of judgment errors in children aged 3 to 9 years when exposed to a risky trade. Children were allocated with a piece of cookie that they could either keep or risk in exchange of the content of one cup among 6, visible in front of them. In the cups, cookies could be of larger, equal or smaller sizes than the initial allocation. Chances of losing or winning were manipulated by presenting different combinations of cookie sizes in the cups (for example 3 large, 2 equal and 1 small cookie). We investigated the rationality of children's response using the theoretical models of Expected Utility Theory (EUT) and Cumulative Prospect Theory. Children aged 3 to 4 years old were unable to discriminate the profitability of exchanging in the different combinations. From 5 years, children were better at maximizing their benefit in each combination, their decisions were negatively induced by the probability of losing, and they exhibited a framing effect, a judgment error found in adults. Confronting data to the EUT indicated that children aged over 5 were risk-seekers but also revealed inconsistencies in their choices. According to a complementary model, the Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT), they exhibited loss aversion, a pattern also found in adults. These findings confirm that adult-like judgment errors occur in children, which suggests that they possess a survival value. © 2013 Steelandt et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In competitive social environments, people often deviate from what rational choice theory prescribes, resulting in losses or suboptimal monetary gains. We investigate how competition affects learning and decision-making in a common value auction task. During the experiment, groups of five human participants were simultaneously scanned using MRI while playing the auction task. We first demonstrate that bidding is well characterized by reinforcement learning with biased reward representations dependent on social preferences. Indicative of reinforcement learning, we found that estimated trial-by-trial prediction errors correlated with activity in the striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Additionally, we found that individual differences in social preferences were related to activity in the temporal-parietal junction and anterior insula. Connectivity analyses suggest that monetary and social value signals are integrated in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and striatum. Based on these results, we argue for a novel mechanistic account for the integration of reinforcement history and social preferences in competitive decision-making. © 2013 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Skin diseases are visible, and identifying abnormal skin generally does not require specialist knowledge. Dermatology is therefore a ripe field for studies of cumulative life course impairment, because of the many diseases that affect not only the patients, but also their psychosocial interaction with others. Dermatological patients are visibly sick. The stigma associated with visible as well as hidden skin diseases is considerable and may have a major negative impact on the life course of patients. Stigma and psychosocial relations are however not the only sources of impairment for patients with dermatological diseases. Hand eczema is a prototypical example of a skin disease that causes life course impairment not only due to stigmatization, but also to a major loss of function. The impairment therefore occurs through several mechanisms increasing the potential impact of hand eczema on patients. The list of skin diseases where an assessment of cumulative life course impairment is relevant can be enlarged considerably. Diseases with functional impairment such as, e.g. scleroderma, diseases with prominent subjective symptoms such as acne or hidradenitis, and diseases with limited physical impairment but massive psychosocial impairment in specific communities such as vitiligo, are all suitable for further studies. Life course studies are particularly suitable for skin diseases due to their often chronic recurrent course, low mortality and their psychosocial aspects. The development of a stronger empirical framework is welcomed, and may lead to considerable benefits for patients. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the past three decades, global agriculture losses have continuously grown due to increasingly severe droughts. Compared with direct economic effects, there are great difficulties in evaluating the indirect economic effects of drought, which has severely lagged behind the urgent information needs for decision making. This study tries to solve the perplexity in the evaluation of the effects of drought on the price fluctuation of agricultural products by building a partial equilibrium model that describes the balancing process of supply and demand quantitatively. Using this model, a scenario analysis is applied to evaluate the price fluctuation of agricultural products caused by drought in North China. The results indicate that there is no major impact of drought on the market prices of eight major agricultural products. Even with the occurrence of a severe drought in North China, market prices of agricultural products will rise no more than 3.59 percent, which is less than the normal market price fluctuations of China’s agricultural products. This study provides a tool for evaluating indirect economic effects of drought. The results of our case study could support decision making for China’s food market regulation. © 2013, The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Economic choices are strongly influenced by whether potential outcomes entail gains or losses. We examined this influence of outcome valence in an economic risk task. We employed three experiments based on our task, each of which provided novel findings, and which together better characterize and explain how outcome valence influences risky choice. First, we found that valence perturbed an individual's choices around that individual's base-level of risk-taking, a base-level consistent across time, and context. Second, this perturbation by valence was highly context dependent, emerging when valence was introduced as a dimension within a decision-making setting, and being reversed by a change in task format (causing more gambling for gains than losses and the reverse). Third, we show this perturbation by valence is explicable by low-level approach-avoidance processes, an hypothesis not previously tested by a causal manipulation. We revealed such an effect, where individuals were less disposed to choose a riskier option with losses when they had to approach (go) as opposed to avoid (nogo) that option. Our data show valence perturbs an individual's choices independently of the impact of risk, and causally implicate approach-avoidance processes as important in shaping economic choice. © 2013 Wright, Morris, Guitart-Masip and Dolan.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Scientists and policy makers issuing predictions and warnings of impending natural disaster are faced with two major challenges, that is, failure to warn and issuing a false alarm. The consequences of failure to warn can be serious for society overall, for example, significant economic losses, heavy infrastructure and environmental damage, large number of human casualties, and social disruption. Failure to warn can also have serious for specific individuals, for example, legal proceedings against disaster research scientists, as in the L'Aquila earthquake affair. The consequences of false alarms may be less serious. Nevertheless, false alarms may violate the principle of nonmaleficence (do no harm), affect individual autonomy (eg, mandatory evacuations), and may result in the \"cry wolf\" effect. Other ethical issues associated with natural disasters include the promotion of global justice through international predisaster technical assistance and postdisaster aid. Social justice within a particular country is promoted through greater postdisaster aid allocation to the less privileged.\u001b[0m :\n",

We find that our results are generally consistent with the theoretical background of behavioral finance. However, there are some differences on the country level. Ukrainian managers exhibited strong risk-seeking behavior in dramatic conditions, and much more risk-averse behavior in favorable conditions (in comparison with other 2 countries). Ukrainian managers were more predisposed towards \"sunk costs\" effect in the condition of economic crises compared to Estonian and Swedish financial managers. Estonian managers showed strong risk-averse behavior in the condition of economic crises and losses in contrast with Ukrainian and Swedish peers. Swedish managers were more willing to take risk under the conditions of economic growth than Ukrainian and Estonian managers. © Mark Kantsukov, Anastasiia Linnas, 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Facing uncertain future conditions, flood-damage-reduction alternatives with large positive expected net benefits may be accompanied with high uncertainty. In decision-making under uncertainty, not only failure probability and failure consequences but also the cost of lost opportunity should be considered so as to enhance risk-informed decision-making for hydrosystem design, planning, and management. This paper proposes a risk measure, i.e., the expected opportunity loss (EOL), in a risk-based framework for flood-damage-reduction project design. The opportunity loss for a chosen alternative is the difference between the payoffs of this alternative and the best payoff of all alternatives. The risk measure of EOL can quantify the adverse consequences associated with making a wrong decision due to the uncertain state of nature and it can also capture the correlation effect of the net benefits of two competing design alternatives. Using EOL, alternatives can be ranked by the minimax regret principle. The acceptable risk of the decision maker is conceptually compatible with EOL and can be used to test the feasibility of the design alternatives under consideration. An example based on a case study for flood damage reduction is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed risk-based decision-making model. The example application shows that the uncertainty of the project net benefits is significant, and thus the explicit consideration of tradeoffs between the project risks and net benefits is essential. Furthermore, the example also shows that the uncertainty and correlation between the net benefit in different projects can have a significant influence on the ranking of alternatives. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

The aim of this study is to determine the level of public awareness regarding this illness, its symptoms, associated factors, available forms of treatment, and the attitude towards depressed people. Methods: A self administered questionnaire was filled in by approximately 5000 individuals selected from various regions of Jordan. Results: The majority of participants thought that depression is a treatable condition that can affect patient at any age, and may be controlled by the will power. Loss of interest in things and presence of negative feelings were the most commonly recognized symptoms of depression, while, unemployment and poverty were found to be the most recognized risk factors for depression. In addition, most participants considered support from family and friends (93.6%) as well as exercise (80.4%) to be the best available forms of depression treatment. Respondents found it acceptable to work, make friends with, or marry depressed individuals. The first choice persons for seeking help by most participants were family members and friends (49.8%). Conclusion: Collectively, the level of awareness of depression was acceptable. However, further efforts are necessary to establish public educational programs related to depression in order to raise awareness regarding the disease. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, a method based on prospect theory is proposed to solve the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problem considering aspiration-levels of attributes, where attribute values and aspiration-levels are represented in two different formats: crisp numbers and interval numbers. According to the idea of prospect theory, aspiration-levels are firstly regarded as the reference points, and the four possible types for comparing an attribute value with an aspiration-level are described. Then, for all possible cases of the four types, the calculation formulae of gains and losses of alternatives concerning attributes are given. By calculating gain and loss of each alternative, a gain matrix and a loss matrix are constructed, respectively. Further, using the value function proposed in prospect theory and the simple additive weighting method, the overall prospect value of each alternative is calculated. Based on the obtained overall prospect values, a ranking of alternatives can be determined. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the use of the proposed method. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract: Apart from interacting, prey and predators may also avoid each other by moving into refuges where they lack food, yet survive by switching to an energy-saving physiological state. Lotka-Volterra models of predator- prey interactions ignore this option. Therefore, we have modelled this game of 'joining versus opting out' by extending Lotka-Volterra models to include portions of populations not in interaction and with different energy dynamics. Given this setting, the prey's decisions to join or to opt out influence those of the predator and vice versa, causing the set of possible strategies to be complex and large. However, using game theory, we analysed and published two models showing (i) which strategies are best for the prey population given the predator's strategy, and (ii) which are best for prey and predator populations simultaneously. The predicted best strategies appear to match empirical observations on plant-inhabiting predator and prey mites. Here, we consider a plausible third model that does not take energy dynamics into account, but appears to yield contrasting predictions. This supports our assumption to extend Lotka-Volterra models with 'interaction-dependent' energy dynamics, but more work is required to prove that it is essential and that what is best for the population is also best for the individual. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

      "Abstract: Studies that use the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and its age-appropriate versions as indices of affective decision-making during childhood and adolescence have demonstrated significant individual differences in scores. Our study investigated the association between general intellectual functioning and socioeconomic status (SES) and its effect on the development of affective decision-making in preschoolers by using a computerized version of the Children's Gambling Task (CGT). We administered the CGT and the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale (CMMS) to 137 Brazilian children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old to assess their general intellectual functioning. We also used the Brazilian Criterion of Economic Classification (CCEB) to assess their SES. Age differences between 3- and 4-years-old, but not between 4- and 5-years-old, confirmed the results obtained by Kerr and Zelazo (2004), indicating the rapid development of affective decision-making during the preschool period. Both 4- and 5-years-old performed significantly above chance on blocks 3, 4, and 5 of the CGT, whereas 3-years-old mean scores did not differ from chance. We found that general intellectual functioning was not related to affective decision-making. On the other hand, our findings showed that children with high SES performed better on the last block of the CGT in comparison to children with low SES, which indicates that children from the former group seem more likely to use the information about the gain/loss aspects of the decks to efficiently choose cards from the advantageous deck throughout the task. © 2013 Mata, Sallum, Miranda, Bechara and Malloy-Diniz.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Higher income is associated with greater well-being, but do income gains and losses affect well-being differently? Loss aversion, whereby losses loom larger than gains, is typically examined in relation to decisions about anticipated outcomes. Here, using subjective-well-being data from Germany (N = 28,723) and the United Kingdom (N = 20,570), we found that losses in income have a larger effect on well-being than equivalent income gains and that this effect is not explained by diminishing marginal benefits of income to well-being. Our findings show that loss aversion applies to experienced losses, challenging suggestions that loss aversion is only an affective-forecasting error. By failing to account for loss aversion, longitudinal studies of the relationship between income and well-being may have overestimated the positive effect of income on well-being. Moreover, societal well-being might best be served by small and stable income increases, even if such stability impairs long-term income growth. © The Author(s) 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

We hypothesize that reporting a loss and its use as a heuristic rather than firms' economic fundamentals has an impact both on the decision to raise external debt finance and on the choice between debt and equity financing. The results are consistent with the hypothesis. We find that there is a sharp and economically-significant discontinuity around the zero-earnings threshold in the level of debt issues. Firms reporting small losses issue significantly less debt than firms reporting small profits. We also find that the loss heuristic has an impact on the choice between debt and equity in that loss firms issue less debt relative to equity. Taken together the results are consistent with the notion that profit versus loss heuristic impacts the debt issuance decision and provide explanations that add to those offered by the traditional theories. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Patients with Parkinson's disease with deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus postoperatively often display higher impulsivity and therefore may experience difficulties in social interactions. Here, we examined social interactions of patients with Parkinson's disease with and without deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus in competitive situations. We hypothesized altered self-estimation and risk-seeking behaviour in this patient group induced by deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus. To test the hypothesis, an experimental setting was used in which participants performed a calculation task and chose their preferred compensation. Based on their actual calculation performance, more patients with Parkinson's disease with deep brain stimulation chose a competitive tournament compensation. Assuming rational behaviour, this selfselection pattern reflects increased risk tolerance. Since patients who performed in the lowest quartile chose the tournament option, the data suggest that deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus results in a loss of the correct reference frame against which patients with Parkinson's disease evaluate their performance. The stimulation-induced combination of overestimation of their own performance, increased risk-taking, and preference for competitive environments despite poor performance is likely to impact considerably on the patients' social and work life. © The Author (2013).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article presents building fire risk analysis model based on scenario clusters and its application in fire risk management of buildings. Building fire risk analysis is a process of understanding and characterizing the fire hazards, the unwanted outcomes that may result from the fire, and the probabilities of fire and unwanted outcomes occurring. The purpose is to evaluate and make a decision about the level of fire risk to determine whether to take appropriate risk management measures or not. Therefore, building fire risk analysis serves as a basis for fire risk management. In the paper, scenario clusters are constructed in the process of building fire risk analysis, and the number of deaths and directive property loss are selected as building fire risk indexes. Finally, the average fire risk of residential buildings is quantified in detail. With the types of detailed fire risk models developed here, fire risk management measures could be taken to improve the building fire safety grading and reduce fire risk levels and subsequent damage. © 2013 The Authors.

However, although much is understood about the effect of losses on cognitive processes and behavior, 2 major inconsistencies remain. First, recent empirical evidence fails to demonstrate that people avoid incentive structures that carry equivalent gains and losses. Second, findings in experience-based decision tasks indicate that following losses, increased arousal is observed simultaneously with no behavioral loss aversion. To account for these findings, we developed an attention-allocation model as a comprehensive framework for the effect of losses. According to this model losses increase on-task attention, thereby enhancing the sensitivity to the reinforcement structure. In the current article we examine whether this model can account for a broad range of empirical phenomena involving losses. We show that as predicted by the attentional model, asymmetric effects of losses on behavior emerge where gains and losses are presented separately but not concurrently. Yet, even in the absence of loss aversion, losses have distinct effects on performance, arousal, frontal cortical activation, and behavioral consistency. The attentional model of losses thus explains some of the main inconsistencies in previous studies of the effect of losses. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The paper presents the results of two stochastic specifications of experimental data obtained in the pairwise choice experiment. In the estimated specifications the strong utility stochastic model was used. A comparative analysis of the results of stochastic specifications based on two decision theories: Rank-Dependent Expected Utility and Cumulative Prospect Theory was performed, which allowed to draw two conclusions. Specification based on CPT structure is more effective in modelling choices over lotteries that contain both gains and losses. However, the reflection effect is observed only in the results of estimation based on RDEU structure. In the estimations with CPT structure the reflection effect did not occur.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Dopamine has been suggested to have direct antinociceptive effects. However, effects on the motivation to endure or to avoid nociceptive stimulation would be more in line with dopamine's well-established role in the motivation to obtain reward. Thus, dopamine might either inhibit or facilitate the perception of nociceptive stimuli to bias an organism towards endurance or avoidance depending on the relative importance of the nociceptive input. To test this hypothesis, we conducted two psychophysical experiments in human volunteers. In Experiment 1, the respective antinociceptive and pro-nociceptive effects of monetary wins and losses were assessed by administering thermal stimuli (three intensities, within-subject factor) while participants simultaneously won, lost, or neither won nor lost (neutral condition) money (within-subject factor) in a wheel-of-fortune task. In Experiment 2, we tested the effect of low-dose sulpiride (a centrally-acting D2-receptor antagonist increasing the synaptic availability of dopamine via predominant pre-synaptic blockade) on the same task as in Experiment 1 using a placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Monetary wins decreased and losses enhanced the perception of nociceptive stimuli, which was highly reproducible. Sulpiride augmented perceptual modulation by monetary outcomes. This augmentation was driven by increased effects of monetary losses on the perception of nociceptive stimuli. The perception of nociceptive stimuli in the absence of monetary wins and losses was not affected by sulpiride. Based on these findings, we propose a new role of dopamine in the context of nociception: biasing the organism towards a decision in situations with conflicting motivations, depending on the relative importance of the nociceptive input. © 2013 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People who feel embarrassed are often motivated to avoid social contact-that is, to hide their face. At the same time, they may be motivated to restore the positive image that has been tarnished by the embarrassing event (or, in other words, to restore the face lost in the event). Individuals can symbolically employ these coping strategies by choosing commercial products that literally either hide their face (e.g., sunglasses) or repair it (e.g., restorative cosmetics). However, the two coping strategies have different consequences. Although symbolically repairing one's face eliminates aversive feelings of embarrassment and restores one's willingness to engage in social activities, symbolically hiding one's face has little impact. © The Author(s) 2013.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Transport users face complex decisions. Not only are the consequences of their choices uncertain, but they generally involve several attributes, such as time and money. Time-money tradeoffs have been studied in depth in transport economics, and research is now paying increasing attention to the role of uncertainty and information in transport decisions. This paper aims to measure the impact of uncertainty and information on multi-attribute decisions using Prospect Theory. In doing so, the study makes two contributions to transportation literature: one methodological and the other empirical. First, we propose a fast and tractable method for measuring Prospect Theory parameters that capture attitudes towards probabilities (probability weighting function) and attitudes towards losses (loss aversion). The elicitation method does not require the elicitation of the utility function. This makes it particularly suitable in complex multi-attribute decisions where the shape of the utility function is unknown. Second, we present the results of an experiment that uses the proposed method to measure, at the individual level, probability weighting in decisions involving joint time and money consequences in two decision contexts: risk (where probabilities are given) and ambiguity (where the probability distribution is unknown). An experimental setup that exposes subjects to real gains and losses for money and time has been built for this purpose. We observe inverse S-shaped probability weighting and loss aversion for risk. Probability weighting is even more pronounced in ambiguity, where subjects do not have precise information about the probability distribution. We explain how these results and the analysis of ambiguity attitudes in general can offer a better understanding of travelers' route or transport mode choices. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: To investigate the influence of cognitive reappraisal, one important kind of emotion regulation strategy, on psychological and electrophysiological responses to gains and losses, a monetary gambling task was performed in two conditions, that is, spontaneity and regulation. Event-related potentials (ERP) and self-rating emotional experiences to outcome feedback were recorded during the task. Cognitive reappraisal reduced self-rating emotional experience to both gains and losses and the amplitudes of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P3 of ERPs. According to these results, we suggest that the application of cognitive reappraisal strategy significantly modulated the motivational salience of current outcomes, thus weakening the subjective emotional experience elicited. In addition, cognitive reappraisal might have changed the allocation of cognitive resources during outcome evaluation. This study extends emotion regulation studies by applying monetary outcomes as emotional stimuli, and also implicates the significance of emotion regulation in decision-making processes. © 2013 Society for Psychophysiological Research.\u001b[0m :\n",

We develop a process modeling-based methodology for managing the risks associated with such data errors. Our method focuses on the topological structure of a process and takes into account its effect on error propagation and risk mitigation using both expected loss and conditional value-at-risk risk measures. Using this method, optimal strategies can be designed for control resource allocation to manage risk in a business process. Our work contributes to the literature on both ex ante risk management-based business process design and ex post risk assessments of existing business processes and control models.

      "Abstract: New insights from psychology and behavioural economics have encouraged a paradigm shift in policy debates towards a focus on 'Nudge' strategies that are influenced by an understanding of the cognitive, social and even moral factors driving human decision making. In areas such as environmental policy Nudging holds considerable potential as a tool of government to help change citizen and corporate behaviour. This article notes the strong evidence base for Nudge strategies drawn from the extensive social science literature on how citizens make decisions. It shows, however, that translating behavioural insights into viable policy interventions is far from straightforward and that the powerful insights embedded within Nudge heuristics will be lost if advocates of Nudge fail to address the complexities and challenges entailed in their project. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we address the issue of the units in which loss and utility are settled and the implications that those units have on the rankings of potential decisions.

      "Abstract: Choices among environmental management alternatives involve tradeoffs where, for example, the benefits of environmental protection may be offset by economic costs or welfare losses to individual agents. Understanding individual or household-level preferences regarding these tradeoffs is not always straightforward, and it often requires an analysis of choices under alternative scenarios. A household survey was used to gather data for a choice experiment, where respondents were asked to choose among pairs of alternative management scenarios about pineapple production in Costa Rica. The experimental design consisted of six attributes that varied on between two and five attribute levels, and the experiment and accompanying survey were administered orally in Spanish. The results show that respondents are willing to make tradeoffs with respect to the management attributes in order to see an overall improvement in environmental quality. Respondents were willing to accept a moderate level of pesticide application, presumably in exchange for paying a lower cost or seeing a gain in another area, such as monitoring or soil conservation. Buffer zones were significant only in the case of large farms. The results have implications for policy decisions that aim to reflect public attitudes, particularly the aspects of pineapple production that matter most to people living near pineapple plantations. The study also highlights the effectiveness of the choice experiment approach in examining household preferences about environmental management in a rural development context. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Instead of using mainstream scenario tree-based techniques, we reduce computational complexity by restricting the space of recourse decisions to those linear and quadratic in the observations, thereby obtaining an upper bound on the original problem. To estimate the loss of accuracy of this approach, we further derive a lower bound by dualizing the original problem and solving it in linear and quadratic recourse decisions. By employing robust optimization techniques, we show that both bounding problems may be approximated by tractable conic programs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous studies suggest in line with dual process models that interoceptive skills affect controlled decisions via automatic or implicit processing. The \"framing effect\" is considered to capture implicit effects of task-irrelevant emotional stimuli on decision-making. We hypothesized that cardiac awareness, as a measure of interoceptive skills, is positively associated with susceptibility to the framing effect. Forty volunteers performed a risky-choice framing task in which the effect of loss versus gain frames on decisions based on identical information was assessed. The results show a positive association between cardiac awareness and the framing effect, accounting for 24% of the variance in the framing effect. These findings demonstrate that good interoceptive skills are linked to poorer performance in risky choices based on ambivalent information when implicit bias is induced by task-irrelevant emotional information. These findings support a dual process perspective on decision-making and suggest that interoceptive skills mediate effects of implicit bias on decisions. © 2013 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The use of Prospect Theory to model route choice has increased in the past decades. The main application issue is how to define the reference point, i.e., the value that travellers use as a reference to distinguish gains and losses in the experienced travel times. Moreover, the question can be asked whether all travellers have the same reference point or whether heterogeneity in their behaviour plays an important role. This paper aims to (i) provide a behavioural interpretation of the reference point, (ii) investigate the role of heterogeneity in the reference point and (iii) discuss how to take heterogeneity into account. These aspects are discussed with the aid of an empirical route choice experiment and a model specification in which travel time is the main variable. Two model frameworks are proposed, one accounting for heterogeneity and another considering no heterogeneity in travellers' behaviour, and their outcomes are compared. Results show improvements in the ability of Prospect Theory to predict route choice behaviour by accounting for heterogeneity in the reference point. This is particularly the case when the reference point reflects travelers' route preferences. Statistical analyses show the significance of accounting for heterogeneity in travellers' behaviour. Thus, we cannot reject the hypothesis that heterogeneity leads to improvements in the prediction ability of Prospect Theory. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: In Switzerland, if certain conditions are met, assisted suicide is not prosecuted. International debate suggests that requests for hasten death are often altered by the provision of palliative care. Aims of the study were to explore patients' reasons for choice of assisted suicide and family perceptions of the interactions with health care professionals. Patients and methods: This is a qualitative study upon 11 relatives of 8 patients cared for by a palliative care team, deceased of assisted suicide. Results: Pain and symptom burden were not regarded by patients as key reasons to seek assisted suicide: existential distress and fear of loss of control were the determinants. Most patients had made pre-illness decisions to use assisted suicide. A general need for perceived control and fear of dependency were reported as a common characteristic of these patients. Patients held misunderstandings about the nature and purpose of palliative care, and the interviewed indicated that patients did not regard provision of palliative care services as influential in preventing their decision. Conclusions: Assisted suicide was preferred despite provision of palliative care. Better understanding of the importance placed on perceived control and anticipated dependency is needed. Further research is needed to develop appropriate support for patients contemplating assisted suicide. © The Author 2013.

      "Abstract: Environment migration research has sought to provide an account of how environmental risks and resources affect migration and mobility. Part of that effort has focused on the role of the environment in providing secure livelihoods through provisioning ecosystem services. However, many of the models of environment migration linkages fail to acknowledge the importance of social and psychological factors in the decision to migrate. Here, we seek to provide a more comprehensive model of migration decision-making under environmental change by investigating the attachment people form to place, and the role of the environment in creating that attachment. We hypothesize that environmental factors enter the migration decision-making process through their contribution to place utility, defined as a function of both affective and instrumental bonds to location, and that ecosystem services, the aspects of ecosystems that create wellbeing, contribute to both components of place utility. We test these ideas in four rural highland settlements in Peru sampled along an altitudinal gradient. We find that non-economic ecosystem services are important in creating place attachment and that ecological place attachment exists independently of use of provisioning ecosystem services. Individuals' attitudes to ecosystem services vary with the type of ecosystem services available at a location and the degree of rurality. While social and economic factors are the dominant drivers of migration in these locations, a loss of non-provisioning ecosystem services leads to a decrease in place utility and commitment to place, determining factors in the decision to migrate. The findings suggest that policy interventions encouraging migration as an adaptation to environmental change will have limited success if they only focus on provisioning services. A much wider set of individuals will experience a decrease in place utility, and migration will be unable to alleviate that decrease since the factors that create it are specific to place. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: An evacuation decision for dam breaks is a very serious issue. A late decision may lead to loss of lives and properties, but a very early evacuation will incur unnecessary expenses. This paper presents a risk-based framework of dynamic decision making for dam-break emergency management (DYDEM). The dam-break emergency management in both time scale and space scale is introduced first to define the dynamic decision problem. The probability of dam failure is taken as a stochastic process and estimated using a time-series analysis method. The flood consequences are taken as functions of warning time and evaluated with a human risk analysis model (HURAM) based on Bayesian networks. A decision criterion is suggested to decide whether to evacuate the population at risk (PAR) or to delay the decision. The optimum time for evacuating the PAR is obtained by minimizing the expected total loss, which integrates the time-related probabilities and flood consequences. When a delayed decision is chosen, the decision making can be updated with available new information. A specific dam-break case study is presented in a companion paper to illustrate the application of this framework to complex dam-breaching problems. © 2013 Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: As the prevalence of tsutsugamushi disease has tripled over the past decade to affect 8307 people in October 2012, this study is conducted to estimate the willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid infection of tsutsugamushi disease in order to analyze the loss of value caused by climate change diseases. Methods: The double-bounded dichotomous choice of contingent valuation method was used to estimate the WTP to avoid infection of tsutsugamushi disease, through surveys conducted in the patient group (. n = 120) and the control group (. n = 240). Results: More young people in the family, higher level of awareness of risks caused by climate change, more male members (as opposed to female), higher income, lower suggested bid, and greater WTP, is better positioned to avoid infection of disease. The mean of the amount of WTP has been estimated to be 3689 Kwon per month. Conclusion: As people have become increasingly aware of climate change diseases, WTP to avoid infection of tsutsugamushi disease has increased accordingly. The implicit loss of value due to climate change diseases is becoming increasingly higher. Therefore, there should be stronger and more aggressive promotional activities to prevent people from being infected with tsutsugamushi disease and to build a healthier society free from climate change diseases. © 2013 .\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aim: Diabetic patients often do not adjust their insulin doses using the algorithms that they have been taught. While this behavior may intuitively have a number of causes, such as the complexity of the decision or the fear of hypoglycaemia, we propose in this article a more general, \"psychophysical\", explanation based on behavioral economics concepts used to describe decisions made under uncertainty and risk. The concepts discussed herein may not be familiar to clinicians, who will find here an introduction to theories that may be helpful in understanding some aspects of non-adherence to medical prescriptions. Results: 1) The Prospect Theory of Kahneman and Tversky proposes that choices made in the context of risk are subject to loss aversion. 2) Decisions under uncertainty use mental short cuts called \"heuristics\", which can lead to biases; for instance, overestimating the probability of the risk. 3) To understand the very concept of risk, emotions must be considered with a special focus on anticipated regret. 4) Finally, selection difficulty is an important determinant of the preference for the status quo. Conclusion: These concepts may be relevant for understanding a preference for the status quo in decisions made in a context of uncertainty and risk, such as insulin dose adjustment. We suggest that these mental mechanisms may also be involved in other aspects of patients' non-adherence. As other common human behaviors, non-adherence may actually often be a consequence of biases resulting from our ways of thinking, being both cognitive and emotional, and, according to Kahneman, more often \"fast\" than \"slow\" Empirical studies are needed to support this hypothesis. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In an uncertain environment, probabilities are key to predicting future events and making adaptive choices. However, little is known about how humans learn such probabilities and where and how they are encoded in the brain, especially when they concern more than two outcomes. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), young adults learned the probabilities of uncertain stimuli through repetitive sampling. Stimuli represented payoffs and participants had to predict their occurrence to maximize their earnings. Choices indicated loss and risk aversion but unbiased estimation of probabilities. BOLD response in medial prefrontal cortex and angular gyri increased linearly with the probability of the currently observed stimulus, untainted by its value. Connectivity analyses during rest and task revealed that these regions belonged to the default mode network. The activation of past outcomes in memory is evoked as a possible mechanism to explain the engagement of the default mode network in probability learning. A BOLD response relating to value was detected only at decision time, mainly in striatum. It is concluded that activity in inferior parietal and medial prefrontal cortex reflects the amount of evidence accumulated in favor of competing and uncertain outcomes. © 2013 d'Acremont et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

Study Design: Unaffected BRCA mutation carriers who were counseled at our center and either underwent prophylactic surgery or participated in a high-risk surveillance program at our institution from 1998 through 2010 were included in the study. Medical records were reviewed and data collected included age, family history, parity, mutation type, history of breast biopsy or cosmetic surgery, and uptake of prophylactic surgeries. Results: Among 136 unaffected women with BRCA mutations, uptake of RRM was 42% and uptake of RRBSO was 52%. Family history of first- and second-degree relatives being deceased from breast cancer was predictive of uptake of RRM and of RRBSO (odds ratio [OR], 11.0; P =.005; and OR, 15.8; P =.023, respectively), and history of a mother lost to pelvic cancer was predictive of uptake of RRBSO (OR, 7.9; P =.001). Parity also predicted both RRM and RRBSO uptake (OR, 4.2; P =.001; and OR, 5.4; P =.003, respectively). Age at the time of genetic testing and history of breast biopsy or cosmetic surgery were not predictive of RRM uptake. Conclusion: Perceptions of cancer risk are heavily influenced by particular features of an individual's family history and may be motivators in preventive surgery more than actual cancer risk estimations themselves. Awareness of subtle factors beyond the statistical risk for cancers is relevant when counseling at-risk women. © 2013 Mosby, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Patient motivations for revisionary breast surgery following breast augmentation, mastopexy-augmentation, and breast reduction are often overlooked. Most patients presenting for a revision do so because they desire a subsequent improvement in their appearance or wish to correct a problem resulting from the primary operation. Objective: We present and analyze the clinical indications for revisionary breast surgery in a series of 134 consecutive cases. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 134 patients who underwent revisionary breast surgery in a single clinic from 1994 to 2009. Patients were grouped based on operative procedure: augmentation (n = 110), mastopexy-augmentation (n = 10), bilateral breast reduction (n = 15), breast malformation correction (n = 1). Three categories were also specified according to the cause for secondary surgery: (1) the surgeon's operative plan was flawed and/or involved a technical error, (2) an independent factor occurred such as ptosis or capsular contracture, or (3) there was a combination of both factors. Results: The most frequent reasons for revisionary surgery among aesthetic implant patients were the development of ptosis (42%), capsular contracture (29%), and lower-pole deformities (19%). Twenty-six percent of patients had a combination of problems. Revision among breast reduction patients was due to volume loss from overresection (40%), nipple-areola loss (27%), and breast asymmetry (27%). The average time between the first surgery and reoperation was 8.9 years for augmentation, 4.3 years for mastopexy- augmentation, and 2.9 years for reduction. In implant patients, the biggest problem leading to revisionary surgery was natural progression (66% augmentation, 90% mastopexy-augmentation). However, among breast reduction patients, 73% of revision requests were a result of problems with surgeon judgment or technique. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that although the rate of surgeon-specific problems was high in reduction patients, overall, independent factors were the primary reason patients sought revisionary breast surgery. This may be contrary to commonly held beliefs that attribute poor results and revision requests to incorrect surgical technique and erroneous surgical decision making. © 2013 The American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper quantifies the notion of greed, and explores its connection with leverage and potential losses, in the context of a continuous-time behavioral portfolio choice model under (cumulative) prospect theory. We argue that the reference point can serve as the critical parameter in defining greed. An asymptotic analysis on optimal trading behaviors when the pricing kernel is lognormal and the S-shaped utility function is a two-piece CRRA shows that both the level of leverage and the magnitude of potential losses will grow unbounded if the greed grows uncontrolled. However, the probability of ending with gains does not diminish to zero even as the greed approaches infinity. This explains why a sufficiently greedy behavioral agent, despite the risk of catastrophic losses, is still willing to gamble on potential gains because they have a positive probability of occurrence whereas the corresponding rewards are huge. As a result, an effective way to contain human greed, from a regulatory point of view, is to impose a priori bounds on leverage and/or potential losses. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It is posited that because of the attentional effect of losses, individuals would show more behavioral consistency in risk-taking tasks with losses, even in the absence of loss aversion. In two studies, the consistency of risky choices across different experience-based tasks was evaluated for gain, loss, and mixed (gain loss) tasks. In both studies, losses facilitated the consistency across tasks: the correlation between risk-taking choices in different tasks increased when the tasks involved frequent losses. Study 2 also showed a positive effect of losses on temporal consistency. Losses increased the correlation between risk-taking levels across two sessions that were 45days apart. Also in Study 2, losses induced consistency between experiential risk-taking choices and self-reported ratings of risky behavior. In both studies, the positive effect of losses on consistency was observed even when the average participant did not exhibit loss aversion. Taken together, the results indicate that losses increase the consistency of risk-taking behavior and suggest that this is due to the effect of losses on attention. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Schizophrenia is generally characterized by various positive and negative symptoms that are accompanied by significant social dysfunction. Various researchers investigated the functional impairments in schizophrenia including impaired theory of mind (TOM), poor integration of affective and cognitive information, and malfunctioning of adaptive and strategic learning process. However, most of the studies were limited to simplified cognitive tests or computerized choice games that exclude real social interaction. The aim of the current study was to investigate human strategies based on the incentives and particularly the cognitive and emotional motivations of free riding. We examined the decision patterns of 41 healthy subjects (HSs) and 37 schizophrenia patients (SZ) during the public goods game (PGG), one of the games simulating human cooperation and free riding in group interactions. Strategic decision processes during the iterative binary PGG were assessed in terms of cognitive understanding, loss sensitivity, and TOM. We found that greed and loss sensitivity both motivated free-riding behavior in the HS, but that they were more vulnerable to greedy incentives than to possible loss. More significantly, the SZ clearly displayed a lower prevalence of free riding and distinct decision patterns from HS. Nonstrategic and unexpectedly low free ridings in the SZ likely arise from poor integration of cognitive and affective information. We suggest that loss sensitivity and TOM as well as cognitive understanding are involved in regulation of the free riding and cooperative behavior. © 2011 The Author.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Developmental research suggests that adolescents may be highly influenced by their peers to take risks. Although youths with callous-unemotional (CU) traits engage in high-risk behaviors in the form of antisocial behavior and aggression, little is known about their decision making, particularly when their peers are present. Youths high on CU traits may be most susceptible to influence, especially when rewards are involved, or they may be highly rational relative to their low CU peers and less susceptible to social peer pressures. The present study used a gambling task with 675 youths (female n = 348), ages 16 to 20 years (M = 16.9, SD =.8). The majority were White British (64%). We experimentally manipulated whether youths made decisions in groups with peers or individually. All members of the group reported on their CU traits. Using multilevel modeling to control for group-level effects, youths with higher levels of CU traits were found to be less sensitive to accruing rewards on the gambling task than youths low on these traits. When in groups, male participants with higher levels of CU traits made quicker decisions to take risks than male participants lower on CU traits, particularly after punishment. Youths with CU traits are distinct in showing a lack of emotion and this may facilitate heightened rationality in responding to rewards. However, results suggest that male adolescents who are high on CU traits may react to the possible frustration of losing by attempting to gain back rewards quickly when their peers are watching. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the logistics service supply chain (LSSC), quality supervision and coordination is an important approach that can ensure the effective operation of LSSC and obtain more customers. This paper aims to study the quality decisions of the functional logistics service provider (FLSP) and the logistics service integrator (LSI) when a service quality defect guarantee is promised by the FLSP. Assuming that customer demand is a function of the quality defect guarantee of the FLSP, the optimal quality decisions of the LSI and FLSP are presented under three typical game modes: Nash game, Stackelberg game, and centralised decision. Numerical analysis is conducted to show how the quality parameters of the customer affect the optimal quality decisionmaking behaviour of the LSI and FLSP. The research results indicate that, under all three game modes, the optimal quality defect guarantee of the FLSP increases as the customer punishment increases, and decreases as the elasticity of the customer demand for the quality defect guarantee increases. In addition, under all three game modes, the optimal quality supervision effort of the LSI is an increasing function of both customer punishment and elasticity of the customer demand for the quality defect guarantee. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: to describe men's and women's experiences of deciding whether to tell people in their social network, including their children, about their pregnancy loss following a termination for fetal abnormality. Design: secondary analysis of qualitative narrative interview data informed by a critical realist approach. Setting: respondents were recruited throughout the United Kingdom and interviewed at home between 2004 and 2005. Participants: twenty-eight women and nine men who had ended a pregnancy diagnosed with a fetal abnormality and who talked about disclosing or not disclosing the termination to others. Findings: few respondents reported having any advice or information about whether or how to disclose their termination. None said they completely concealed their decision from adults in their social network; most said they disclosed selectively, telling close friends and family they had terminated and acquaintances they had miscarried. Most respondents reported telling their young children that the baby had died but did not reveal that they had chosen to end the pregnancy. A minority had not told their existing offspring about the pregnancy loss. Common reasons given for (partially) concealing a termination were: guilt over the decision; to avoid being judged; and to protect other people's feelings. Common reasons for disclosure were: others knew of the pregnancy; needing time off work; needing practical help and/or emotional support during diagnosis and termination; and wanting recognition of their loss. Positive consequences of disclosure were said to be getting more support and less criticism than expected; negative consequences included not getting the anticipated support and empathy; and encountering disapproval. Some respondents felt that concealing their pregnancy loss from their children had resulted in their confusion over the cause of their parents' distress. Some men said they found it hard to access emotional support from their social networks because of expectations about how men 'should' deal with emotions. Key conclusions and implications for practice: midwives have to make difficult judgements about what, how and when to provide information when trying to support and advise parents who have ended a pregnancy due to fetal abnormality. Further education and training in this area could be of benefit. Midwives could signpost parents to existing sources of advice around disclosure, taking into account parents' individual preferences, help parents to consider the potential implications of disclosure and concealment and different ways of disclosing. They could also recommend alternative sources of emotional support, bearing in mind that men in particular may find it harder to access support from their social networks. © 2011.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Individuals are frequently faced with risky decisions involving the potential for both gain and loss. Exploring the role of both potential gains and potential losses in predicting risk taking is critical to understanding how adolescents and adults make the choice to engage in or avoid a real-life risk. This study aimed to examine the impact of potential losses as well as gains on adolescent decisions during risky choice in a laboratory task. Adolescent (n = 18) and adult (n = 16) participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during a mixed gambles task, and completed questionnaires measuring real-world risk-taking behaviors. While potential loss had a significantly greater effect on choice than potential gain in both adolescents and adults and there were no behavioral group differences on the task, adolescents recruited significantly more frontostriatal circuitry than adults when choosing to reject a gamble. During risk-seeking behavior, adolescent activation in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was negatively correlated with self-reported likelihood of risk taking. During risk-avoidant behavior, mPFC activation of in adults was negatively correlated with self-reported benefits of risk-taking. Taken together, these findings reflect different neural patterns during risk-taking and risk-avoidant behaviors in adolescents and adults. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent fMRI studies have investigated brain activity involved in the feeling of regret and disappointment by manipulating the feedback participants saw after making a decision to play certain gambles: full-feedback (regret: participant sees the outcomes from both the chosen and unchosen gamble) vs. partial-feedback (disappointment: participant only sees the outcome from chosen gamble). However, regret and disappointment are also characterized by differential agency attribution: personal agency for regret, external agency for disappointment. In this study, we investigate the neural correlates of these two characterizations of regret and disappointment using magnetoencephalography (MEG). To do this, we experimentally induced each emotion by manipulating feedback (chosen gamble vs. unchosen gamble), agency (human vs. computer choice) and outcomes (win vs. loss) in a fully randomized design. At the behavioral level the emotional experience of regret and disappointment were indeed affected by both feedback and agency manipulations. These emotions also differentially affect subsequent choices, with regret leading to riskier behavior. At the neural level both feedback and agency affected the brain responses associated with regret and disappointment, demonstrating differential localization in the brain for each. Notably, feedback regret showed greater brain activity in the right anterior and posterior regions, with agency regret producing greater activity in the left anterior region. These findings extend the evidence for neural activity in processing both regret and disappointment by highlighting for the first time the respective importance of feedback and agency, as well as outlining the temporal dynamics of these emotions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Using Gray and McNaughton's (2000) revised reinforcement sensitivity theory (r-RST), we examined the influence of personality on processing of words presented in gain-framed and loss-framed anti-speeding messages and how the processing biases associated with personality influenced message acceptance. The r-RST predicts that the nervous system regulates personality and that behaviour is dependent upon the activation of the behavioural activation system (BAS), activated by reward cues and the fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS), activated by punishment cues. According to r-RST, individuals differ in the sensitivities of their BAS and FFFS (i.e.; weak to strong), which in turn leads to stable patterns of behaviour in the presence of rewards and punishments, respectively. It was hypothesised that individual differences in personality (i.e.; strength of the BAS and the FFFS) would influence the degree of both message processing (as measured by reaction time to previously viewed message words) and message acceptance (measured three ways by perceived message effectiveness, behavioural intentions, and attitudes). Specifically, it was anticipated that, individuals with a stronger BAS would process the words presented in the gain-frame messages faster than those with a weaker BAS and individuals with a stronger FFFS would process the words presented in the loss-frame messages faster than those with a weaker FFFS. Further, it was expected that greater processing (faster reaction times) would be associated with greater acceptance for that message. Driver licence holding students (N = 108) were recruited to view one of four anti-speeding messages (i.e.; social gain-frame, social loss-frame, physical gain-frame, and physical loss-frame). A computerised lexical decision task assessed participants' subsequent reaction times to message words, as an indicator of the extent of processing of the previously viewed message. Self-report measures assessed personality and the three message acceptance measures. As predicted, the degree of initial processing of the content of the social gain-framed message mediated the relationship between the reward sensitive trait and message effectiveness. Initial processing of the physical loss-framed message partially mediated the relationship between the punishment sensitive trait and both message effectiveness and behavioural intention ratings. These results show that reward sensitivity and punishment sensitivity traits influence cognitive processing of gain-framed and loss-framed message content, respectively, and subsequently, message effectiveness and behavioural intention ratings. Specifically, a range of road safety messages (i.e.; gain-frame and loss-frame messages) could be designed which align with the processing biases associated with personality and which would target those individuals who are sensitive to rewards and those who are sensitive to punishments. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Utility theory can be used to model the decision process involved in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of systems that protect against a risk to assets. A key variable in the model is the coefficient of relative risk aversion (or simply \"risk-aversion\") which reflects the decision maker's reluctance to invest in such safety systems. This reluctance to invest is the scaled difference in expected utility before and after installing the safety system and has a minimum at some given value of risk-aversion known as the \"permission point\", and it has been argued that decisions to sanction safety systems would be made at this point. As the cost of implementing a safety system increases, this difference in utility will diminish. At some point, the \"point of indiscriminate decision\", the decision maker will not be able to discern any benefit from installing the safety system. This point is used to calculate the maximum reasonable cost of a proposed safety system. The value of the utility difference at which the decision maker is unable to discern any difference is called the \"discrimination limit\". By considering the full range of accident probabilities, costs of the safety system and potential loss of assets, an average risk-aversion can be calculated from the model. This paper presents the numerical and computational techniques employed in performing these calculations. Two independent approaches to the calculations have been taken, the first of which is the derivative-based secant method, an extension of the referred derivative method employed in previous papers. The second is the Golden Bisection Method, based on a Golden Section Search algorithm, which was found to be more robust but less efficient than the secant method. The average risk-aversion is a function of several key parameters: the organisation's assets, the probability and maximum cost of an incident, and the discrimination limit. An analysis of the sensitivity of the results to changes in these parameters is presented. An average risk-aversion of 0.8-1.0 is found for a wide range of parameters appropriate to individuals or small companies, while an average risk-aversion of 0.1 is found for large corporations. This reproduces the view that large corporations will be risk neutral until faced with risks that pose a threat to their viability. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Rationale: Decision-making deficits, measured using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), are observed in many psychiatric populations. Additionally, evidence suggests that the environment also influences the development of these same disorders. Objective: To determine the direct influence of the environment on decision-making by utilizing the rat gambling task (rGT), a risky decision-making test modeled after the IGT. Methods: Male rats reared in isolation, in pairs, or in an enriched environment were trained on the rGT as adults. During the rGT, animals chose from four different options. The optimal strategy on the rGT and IGT is the same: to favor options associated with smaller immediate rewards and less punishment/loss. Impulsive action is also measured during rGT performance by recording the number of premature responses made, similar to the five-choice serial reaction time task. Results: Compared to pair-housed rats, isolated and environmentally enriched rats were slower at learning the optimal strategy. However, following training, only isolation-reared rats chose the disadvantageous options more often. Amphetamine altered decision-making on the rGT in socially housed animals, yet isolates were unaffected. Conversely, amphetamine increased premature responding similarly in all groups. This increase was attenuated by prior administration of a dopamine D1 or D2 antagonist; however, the ability of amphetamine to alter decision-making was not blocked by either drug. Conclusions: Housing environment affects animals' ability to learn and perform a decision-making task. Additionally, amphetamine's effect on impulsive action appears to be mediated by the dopaminergic system, whereas its effect on risky decision-making may be mediated by other neurotransmitters. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The feedback-related negativity (FRN) is thought to index activity within the midbrain dopaminergic reward-learning system, with larger FRN magnitudes observed when outcomes are worse than expected. This view holds that the FRN is an index of neural activity coding for prediction errors, and reflects activity that can be used to adaptively alter future performance. Untested to date, however, is a key prediction of this view: the FRN should not appear in response to negative outcomes when outcome expectations are not allowed to develop. The current study tests this assumption by eliciting FRNs to win and loss feedback in conditions of participant choice, participant observation of computer choice, and, critically, simple presentation of win or loss feedback in the absence of a predictive choice cue. Whereas FRNs were observed in each of the conditions in which there was time for an expectation to develop, no FRN was observed in conditions without sufficient time for the development of an expectation. These results provide empirical support for an untested but central tenet of the reinforcement learning account of the genesis of the FRN. © 2012 Society for Psychophysiological Research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recessions pose something of a dilemma for policymakers with respect to competition policy. Despite compelling evidence that relaxing competition policy during a recession is likely to have quite profound adverse economic consequences in terms of, for example, retarding the subsequent recovery, policymakers may nevertheless relax competition policy to try to prevent job losses and firm insolvency. In Ireland the policy response has been ambivalent. At first, between 2008-2010, competition policy carve out/exemptions were proposed, senior appointments to the Competition Authority were delayed or not made. However, in December 2010 the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland set a strongly pro-competition agenda. But will it last beyond the end of 2013, when the programme expires? There is reason for optimism. If the economy has recovered or is at least growing there will be less pressure for the state to accede to demands for carve outs and other such anti-competitive measures. If the EU-IMF reforms have successfully bedded down in terms of, for example, introducing greater competition in the service sector, turning back the clock may be difficult, since there will be public support for the results of the reforms. The EU-IMF inspired reforms to competition policy and their underlying rationale may be successful in persuading senior decision makers in government, both elected and nonelected, of the merits of competition. Policymakers often claim that they want evidence based policy. The reforms in the EU-IMF Programme are firmly grounded on the literature concerning the impact of relaxing competition policy as well as the Competition Authority's research into the professions. In contrast, there is little or no evidence to support the 2008-2010 interregnum.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper studies a newsvendor game in which two substitutable products are sold by two different retailers (newsvendors) with loss-averse preferences. Each loss-averse retailer facing stochastic customer demand and deterministic substitution rate will make an order quantity decision to maximize his expected utility. Since product substitution causes two retailers to make decisions in a competitive environment, game theory is used to find the retailers' optimal order quantities. It is shown that under certain conditions, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the newsvendor game. Under a symmetry assumption, each retailer's equilibrium order quantity is decreasing in the loss aversion coefficient and increasing in the substitution rate. Further, if the effect of loss aversion on the order quantity is strong enough to dominate the effect of competition, the total inventory level of a decentralized supply chain will be lower than that of a centralized supply chain. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Sense of agency refers to the feeling that one's voluntary actions caused external events. Past studies have shown that compression of the subjective temporal interval between actions and external events, called intentional binding, is closely linked to the experience of agency. Current theories postulate that the experience of agency is constructed via predictive and postdictive pathways. One remaining problem is the source of human causality bias; people often make misjudgments on the causality of voluntary actions and external events depending on their rewarding or punishing outcomes. Although human causality bias implies that sense of agency can be modified by post-action information, convincing empirical findings for this issue are lacking. Here, we hypothesized that sense of agency would be modified by affective valences of action outcomes. To examine this issue, we investigated how rewarding and punishing outcomes following voluntary action modulate behavioral measures of agency using intentional binding paradigm and classical conditioning procedures. In the acquisition phase, auditory stimuli were paired with positive, neutral or negative monetary outcomes. Tone-reward associations were evaluated using reaction times and preference ratings. In the experimental session, participants performed a variant of intentional binding task, where participants made timing judgments for onsets of actions and sensory outcomes while playing simple slot games. Our results showed that temporal binding was modified by affective valences of action outcomes. Specifically, intentional binding was attenuated when negative outcome occurred, consistent with self-serving bias. Our study not only provides evidence for postdictive modification of agency, but also proposes a possible mechanism of human causality bias. © 2012 Takahata et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The process of comparing obtained outcomes to alternative possible outcomes, known as counterfactual thinking, is inescapable in daily life; however, the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying counterfactual thinking and how they influence emotional responses to better and worse outcomes is not well understood. We conducted an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) gambling study in which participants were informed of two equally possible outcomes of a card gamble before they selected a card. Participants reported experiencing mixed emotions (i.e., both positive and negative affect) for disappointing wins (winning the lesser of two amounts) and relieving losses (losing the lesser of two amounts). Neuroimaging results supported the hypothesis that these mixed emotions were associated with activation of a fronto-parietal network, which subsequently influenced processing in reward and punishment regions (dorsal and ventral striatum, right anterior insula). The fronto-parietal network was sensitive to outcomes that resulted in mixed emotions, whereas reward and punishment regions were sensitive to comparisons between obtained and unobtained outcomes. These findings provide insight into the neurocognitive mechanisms underlying the mixed emotional experiences that result from counterfactual comparisons, and inform our understanding of how the brain is optimized to use the wealth of environmental information to inform current and future behavior. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper addresses two fundamental issues that arise broadly in human response to natural hazards: the effect on overall costs of the high variability (power laws) in event size statistics and complexities associated with combining disparate sources of information in decision-making. To address these issues in a series of concrete scenarios, we analyse data for California wildfires. We also develop a modelling framework that projects costs based on the combination of a dynamic fire spread model, an economic cost model and population data. Our study uses model-generated fire catalogues to estimate the effect of suppression strategies on fire size, and our cost function incorporates both suppression costs and loss of assets. Together, these yield statistical estimates of the average economic impact of fire response policies. Tradeoffs between resource costs and assets at risk determine the optimal response for an individual fire. We also compare the costs of different policies for division of limited resources between multiple fires using scenarios motivated by the 2003 and 2007 California wildfire seasons.

      "Abstract: Beran et al. (2012) reported that capuchin monkeys closely matched the performance of humans in a quantity judgment test in which information was incomplete but a judgment still had to be made. In each test session, subjects first made quantity judgments between two known options. Then, they made choices where only one option was visible. Both humans and capuchin monkeyswere guided by past outcomes, as they shifted from selecting a known option to selecting an unknown option at the point at which the known option went from being more than the average rate of return to less than the average rate of return from earlier choices in the test session. Here, we expanded this assessment of what guides quantity judgment choice behavior in the face of incomplete information to include manipulations to the unselected quantity.We manipulated the unchosen set in two ways: first, we showed the monkeys what they did not get (the unchosen set), anticipating that \"losses\" would weigh heavily on subsequent trials in which the same known quantity was presented. Second, we sometimes gave the unchosen set to another monkey, anticipating that this social manipulation might influence the risk-taking responses of the focal monkey when faced with incomplete information. However, neither manipulation caused difficulty for the monkeys who instead continued to use the rational strategy of choosing known sets when they were as large as or larger than the average rate of return in the session, and choosing the unknown (riskier) set when the known set was not sufficiently large. As in past experiments, this was true across a variety of daily ranges of quantities, indicating that monkeys were not using some absolute quantity as a threshold for selecting (or not) the known set, but instead continued to use the daily average rate of return to determine when to choose the known versus the unknown quantity. © 2012 Beran, Perdue, Parrish and Evans.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We examined the effects of time perspective (present vs. future) and salience (high vs. low) of possible monetary losses on intertemporal choices in 2 experiments and found that people with high future time perspective (FTP) preferred larger but later rewards while those with low FTP preferred smaller but immediate rewards. When the future possibility of zero gain was explicitly cued in the present option, this reminded participants of the chance of future loss and eliminated the differences in temporal preferences between those with high and low FTP. In contrast, present zero gain cued in the future option neither raised the participants' consideration of possible present loss nor changed their temporal preference. Possible future losses were determined to be chronically salient in high FTP participants and situationally salient in conditions in which future zero was explicitly cued. Moreover, the tradeoff process was found to mediate the relationship between the salience of possible future losses and temporal preferences. © Society for Personality Research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Both guilt and regret typically result from counterfactual evaluations of personal choices that caused a negative outcome and are thought to regulate human decisions by people's motivation to avoid these emotions. Despite these similarities, studies asking people to describe typical situations of guilt and regret identified the social dimension as a fundamental distinguishing factor, showing that guilt but not regret specifically occurs for choices in interpersonal (social) contexts. However, an experimental paradigm to investigate this distinction systematically by inducing emotions of guilt and regret online is still missing. Here, extending existing procedures, we introduce such a paradigm, in which participants choose in each trial between two lotteries, with the outcome of the chosen lottery (gain or loss) being either assigned to themselves (intrapersonal trials) or to another person (interpersonal trials). After results of both the chosen and the unchosen lotterywere shown, subjects rated howthey felt about the outcome, including ratings of guilt and regret. Trait Guilt (TG) was determined for all participants in order to take their general inclination to experience guilt into account. Results confirmed that guilt but not regret specifically occurred in an interpersonal context. Percentages of loss averse choices (choosing the lottery with the lower possible monetary loss) were determined as indicators of regulation via guilt and regret avoidance. High TG scorers generally made more loss averse choices than low TG scorers, while trial-by-trial analyses showed that low TG scorers used their feelings of guilt more specifically to avoid the same emotional experience in subsequent choices. Our results confirm the social dimension as the critical factor distinguishing guilt from regret and identifyTG as an important moderator determining the way in which guilt vs. regret can regulate their own occurrence by influencing choice strategies. © 2012 Wagner, Handke, Dörfel and Walter.\u001b[0m :\n",

Based on Simon's original description, we explicitly model bounded rationality as a decision mechanism that captures incomplete information, psychological adaptation, and rational behavior. We find that the endogenous loss aversion and optimism emerge when the degree of information incompleteness reaches a certain threshold, and both grow to be more prominent when information becomes sparser.

      "Abstract: New ventures are often launched for the purpose of pioneering an innovative new product or service in the marketplace. Entrepreneurs or founders of new ventures thus often have to make the decision whether to be the market pioneer or the first mover. While being a first mover potentially is advantageous, it also involves taking risks and facing uncertainties. Entrepreneurs must assess the benefits and risks of pioneering in the first-mover decision-making process to realize the potential competitive advantages associated with being a pioneer. Previous research has shown how entrepreneurs perceive potential gains and losses associated with exploring opportunities as the key defining element of entrepreneurial decision-making. Past studies have also indicated that cultural and business environmental factors affect both perceptions and decision-making. However, studies to date have insufficiently addressed the relationship between entrepreneurs' perceived pioneering advantages/disadvantages and their first-mover decisions, with little attention to cross-national differences. This study includes hypotheses postulating how entrepreneurs' perceived advantages and disadvantages of pioneering affect the number of first-mover decisions made by entrepreneurs in two different cultural contexts, the United States and China. We collect data from 152 U.S. entrepreneurs and 140 Chinese entrepreneurs over a four-year period and carry out empirical tests on the hypotheses using Poisson regression models. Our results provide insight on how culture affects perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of pioneering, and how these perceptions impact the likelihood of making a first-mover decision. We find that a higher level of perceived advantages will drive first-mover decisions, whereas perceived disadvantages will deter first-mover decisions. The negative effect of perceived erosion disadvantages on the number of first-mover decisions was higher for Chinese entrepreneurs, consistent with the high risk-aversion culture in China. However, this effect was not found for perceived uncertainty disadvantages, suggesting that the risk-averse characteristics of Chinese entrepreneurs is an oversimplification, and that the Chinese cultural, business, and legal environment helps offset uncertainty disadvantages. We also find an interesting positive moderating effect of perceived advantage on the relationship between perceived disadvantages and the number of first-mover decisions in China only. That is, if perceived advantages are low, Chinese entrepreneurs are more risk averse than U.S. entrepreneurs; but if perceived advantages are high, Chinese entrepreneurs are more risk-seeking than U.S. entrepreneurs. This finding again challenges the risk aversion conclusion found by previous studies of Chinese managers. © 2012 Product Development & Management Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research has shown that many choice biases are attenuated when short-run decisions are reframed to the long run. However, this literature has been limited to description-based choice tasks in which possible outcomes and their probabilities are explicitly specified. A recent literature has emerged showing that many core results found using the description paradigm do not generalize to experience-based choice tasks in which possible outcomes and their probabilities are learned from sequential sampling. In the current study, we investigated whether this description-experience choice gap occurs in the long run. We examined description- and experience-based preferences under two traditional short run framed choice tasks (single-play, repeated-play) and also a long-run frame (multi-play). We found a reduction in the size of the description-experience gap in the long-run frame, which was attributable to greater choice maximizing in the description format and reduced overweighting of rare events in the experience format. We interpret these results as a \"broad bracketing\" effect: the long-run mindset attenuates short-run biases such as loss aversion and reliance on small samples. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Tax Administration is a risky business. When taxes are not well administered, tax morale may be undermined and unnecessary administrative and compliance costs incurred. Mainstream economics and the self-interested rational choice model provide a powerful contribution to understanding the effects of taxation but that analysis has not always been enough to avoid serious and expensive difficulties. Behavioural economics has been making an increasing contribution to understanding how tax administration may be improved. Some of the assumptions of mainstream economics have been subject to close scrutiny and DellaVigna (2009) summarized deviations from the standard model as non-standard preferences, non-standard beliefs and non-standard decision-making. In recent years considerable analysis and evidence have been presented on the importance of aspects such as fairness in taxation, the endowment effect, framing of decisions, limited attention, loss aversion and mental accounting and their impact on the operation of a tax system. A risk management approach to tax administration has been developed by the European Commission, the OECD and others. One area that has received less attention than may be appropriate is the performance of tax agencies themselves. This paper therefore outlines the contribution behavioural economics can make to existing approaches in reducing the risks of tax administration and extends it to the performance of tax authorities themselves. © School of Taxation and Business Law (Atax), Australian School of Business.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: One consequence of the eroding business model of quality newspapers in Western countries is the reduction in the number of permanent correspondents and regional bureaus. It has been argued that the importance of foreign correspondents has been overstated and that news agencies, social networks and citizen-journalism can fill the gap. In contrast, the authors argue that the loss of presence in foreign countries has harmed the news media's ability to uncover evolving crises and provide in-depth and reliable background reporting. This is particularly problematic for conflict prevention because decision-makers use quality news media alongside intelligence reports for identifying and prioritizing threats. Cost-considerations stand in the way of re-opening foreign bureaus, but quality news providers need to become more inventive in how they can preserve the early warning function of quality news coverage. One way forward is to cultivate links with country and area specialists from academia, NGOs and the non-profit media. © The Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Escalation of commitment denotes decision makers' increased reinvestment of resources in a losing course of action. Despite the relevance of this topic, little is known about how information is processed in escalation situations, that is, whether decision makers who receive negative outcome feedback on their initial decision search for and/or process information biasedly and whether these biases contribute to escalating commitment. Contrary to a widely cited study by E. J. Conlon and J. M. Parks (1987), in 3 experiments, the authors found that biases do not occur on the level of information search. Neither in a direct replication and extension of the original study with largely increased test power (Experiment 1) nor under methodologically improved conditions (Experiments 2 and 3) did decision makers responsible for failure differ from nonresponsible decision makers with regards to information search, and no selective search for information supporting the initial decision or voting for further reinvestment was observed. However, Experiments 3 and 4 show that the evaluation of the previously sought information is biased among participants who were responsible for initiating the course of action. Mediation analyses show that this evaluation bias in favor of reinvestment partially mediated the responsibility effect on escalation of commitment. © 2011 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Orphaned children in poor rural communities sometimes have no adult who is able to care for them or else the adult caregiver is not able to provide adequate care. Tanzania remains one of the poorest countries in the world, and poverty frequently constrains foster care. Although HIV prevalence is declining, AIDS is still a major cause of orphaning. This article explores the challenges and coping strategies accompanying two possible life trajectories for orphaned children without adequate adult care: 1) that they remain in rural areas in child-headed households, or 2) that they are trafficked to an urban area. Antonovsky's salutogenic model is used as the theoretical framework. The data come from two separate phenomenological studies with vulnerable children. In the first study, in-depth interviews were held with 12 orphaned children in a poor rural area; data concerning three child heads of households are included here. In the second study, 15 girls who were trafficked from rural areas to Dar es Salaam gave extended life-history narrations; data are included for nine of the girls who were orphaned. Loss of parents, a lack of cash, and the need to balance school attendance with food production were chronic stressors for the children heading households, while resources included income-generation strategies and the ability to negotiate with teachers for time to cultivate. For the trafficked girls chronic stressors included exploitation, long working hours, little or no pay, isolation and rape. Resources for them, although limited, included faith networks and neighbours; escape from the exploitative situation frequently involved external help. We conclude that given physical and social assets the child-headed households were able to cope with the challenges of caring for themselves and a younger child, but isolation and dependency on employers made it difficult for the trafficked girls to cope with this exploitation. The salutogenic model proved a useful tool in analysing the coping strategies of children living without adequate adult care. Copyright © NISC (Pty) Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Reported cases of concern in chickens by researchers have primarily been targeted at direct mortality, secondary bacterial infections, immuno-suppression with major impacts on production efficiency and decrease responses to vaccination. This study evaluates economic losses of 3 successive recurrent outbreaks of IBD in a commercial poultry farm in Kano, Nigeria and also projected 3 year (2009-2011) economic losses. Contrary to many research findings, increased age dependence and high mortality rates were observed during the study. Spreadsheet method of disease analysis (2003) was used to project economic loss of over three billion naira during these years under study. Due to high prevalence of IBD in Nigeria, it has become necessary to attempt to quantify the economic impact of IBD so that its economic losses could be appreciated, quick decisions are made on how best to prevent, control and design research priorities.

School closure processes are highly (and bitterly) contested, rife with conflict, and with few exceptions, harshly criticized by school and community stakeholders who see closures as a loss of irreplaceable social infrastructure. There is a need for a more nuanced planning style that acknowledges the realities of politics, unequal power relations and the validity of community residents' needs and values.To better understand the consequences of school closures upon communities, the authors evaluate the historical and current school closure decision-making process in Ontario. This entails a four part approach: understanding the role that schools play and the impacts of closure, especially on inner-city communities; examining the reasons for closures; exploring the closure process itself, comparing and contrasting process intent with application experiences; and, identifying alternatives to existing schoolclosures decision-making processes and framework.

      "Abstract: This study examines investors' preference for framing their gains and losses using trading records of individual investors at a large brokerage firm in Tehran Stock Exchange. In mental accounting theory, framing means the way a person subjectively frames a transaction in his mind that will determine the utility he receives or expects. We found that investors tend to bundle sales of losses on the same day and separate sales of wins over different days. The result is consistent with the principles of mental accounting, according to which individuals attain higher utility by integrating losses and segregating gains. Another result of this study shows that the gain or loss on the transaction is the decision criteria for the sale of stock by individual investors and individual investors' decision making methods comply with the mental accounting principles. They tend to make decisions based on wins and losses when selling their shares. This study also shows that there is a relationship between relative profits / losses and the decision to sell. In other words, individual investors collect all losses together and separate all the benefits. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Virtual worlds present more options on how people can \"meet,\" attracting corporations, nonprofits, and government entities to navigate these new worlds that demand computer skills yet offer benefits in reduced travel time, expenditures, and carbon footprints. This study utilized qualitative interviews with experienced hosts of social virtual-world events representing a variety of industries. Questions were designed to elicit responses about the decision-making process in selecting virtual worlds for meetings and events for business applications, as well as to discover opportunities and challenges in in-world collaborations. The research extends the technology acceptance model by examining use of technology beyond the individual's intention to the decision making of choosing technology-specifically virtual worlds-on behalf of an organization for attendees to use. Responses raised practical implications on the unique attributes and sense of presence in a 3D virtual world. This includes fantastic environments evoking fun, playfulness, and creativity, to limitations of the technological learning curve and risk factors, such as loss of control, privacy, and security. This study can be used as a basis for future research on Second Life and other virtual worlds for business-to-business and business-to-consumer collaboration, particularly for the meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) industry. Findings also provide real-world considerations that are beneficial for meeting and event planners exploring virtual-world events or hybrid events. © 2012 Cognizant Comm.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Weight-related stigmatization is a public health problem. It impairs the psychological well-being of obese individuals and hinders them from adopting weight-loss behaviors. We conducted an experimental study to investigate weight stigmatization in work settings using a sample of experienced human resource (HR) professionals from a real-life employment setting. Methods. In a cross-sectional, computer-based experimental study, a volunteer sample of 127 HR professionals (age: 41.1 ± 10.9 yrs., 56% female), who regularly make career decisions about other people, evaluated individuals shown in standardized photographs regarding work-related prestige and achievements. The photographed individuals differed with respect to gender, ethnicity, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Results: Participants underestimated the occupational prestige of obese individuals and overestimated it for normal-weight individuals. Obese people were more often disqualified from being hired and less often nominated for a supervisory position, while non-ethnic normal-weight individuals were favored. Stigmatization was most pronounced in obese females. Conclusions: The data suggest that HR professionals are prone to pronounced weight stigmatization, especially in women. This highlights the need for interventions targeting this stigmatization as well as stigma-management strategies for obese individuals. Weight stigmatization and its consequences needs to be a topic that is more strongly addressed in clinical obesity care. © 2012 Giel et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A prevalent stereotype is that people become less risk taking and more cautious as they get older. However, in laboratory studies, findings are mixed and often reveal no age differences. In the current series of experiments, we examined whether age differences in risk seeking are more likely to emerge when choices include a certain option (a sure gain or a sure loss). In four experiments, we found that age differences in risk preferences only emerged when participants were offered a choice between a risky and a certain gamble but not when offered two risky gambles. In particular, Experiments 1 and 2 included only gambles about potential gains. Here, compared with younger adults, older adults preferred a certain gain over a chance to win a larger gain and thus, exhibited more risk aversion in the domain of gains. But in Experiments 3 and 4, when offered the chance to take a small sure loss rather than risking a larger loss, older adults exhibited more risk seeking in the domain of losses than younger adults. Both their greater preference for sure gains and greater avoidance of sure losses suggest that older adults weigh certainty more heavily than younger adults. Experiment 4 also indicates that older adults focus more on positive emotions than younger adults do when considering their options, and that this emotional shift can at least partially account for age differences in how much people are swayed by certainty in their choices. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Risk management involves assessing risks, evaluating alternatives and implementing solutions and it is a problem of multicriteria decision making (MCDM), where retrofit alternatives are predefined and the decisionmaker(s) (DMs) evaluate them based on multiple criteria. Risk managers choose from a variety of methods to minimize the effects of accidental loss upon their organizations. In the literature it is possible to meet many techniques used for risk management. Besides of these techniques computational intelligence techniques have been used for risk management in decision making process in a wide area. The intelligence can be defined as the capability of a system to adapt its behavior to meet its goals in a range of environments and the life process itself provides the most common form of intelligence. Computational intelligence (CI) can be defined as the study of the design of intelligent agents. In this chapter the CI techniques for risk management in decision making is given with a wide literature review and a detailed classification of the existing methodologies is made. The direction of CI for risk management in the future is evaluated. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We set out to investigate suicide among women in a post-conflict context in Northern Uganda using qualitative psychological autopsy interviews. Three to five relatives and friends for each of the three suicides recruited were interviewed (N = 11). Through interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) we found that the women all had been through traumatic experiences attributable to the protracted war/conflict between the rebel groups and Ugandan Government armed forces. Nevertheless, the decision of self-inflicted death seemed to have been due to a combination of unpleasant experiences/events that prevailed within the last 3 months prior to the suicide. These experiences are summarized in two broad themes: No control in life and No care. Changes in the traditional gender roles, men's quest for their lost masculinity, and women's attempt to fight for their rights that was perceived as a cultural transgression contributed to the women's suicides.

      "Abstract: Organizational decision making often occurs in the face of uncertainty about whether a decision maker's choices will lead to benefit or disaster. Risk is the potential that a decision will lead to a loss or an undesirable outcome. In fact, almost any human decision carries some risk, but some decisions are much more risky than others. Risk and decision making are two inter-related factors in organizational management, and they are both related to various uncertainties. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We report data from a prosopagnosic patient (PHD), and aged-matched control participants, from experiments where participants categorised individually presented emotional faces (Experiment 1) and Thatcherised (from typical) faces (Experiment 2). In Experiment 2 participants also discriminated between simultaneously presented Thatcherised and typical faces. PHD was at chance categorising Thatcherised from typical faces. He was, however, able to discriminate between Thatcherised and typical faces, and partially able to categorise emotional faces. The results are discussed in terms of a loss of configural processing but preserved feature processing in PHD. The loss of configural processing impacts his categorisation of Thatcherised and typical faces, and his emotion processing, while his preserved feature processing supports his ability to categorise some emotional faces and his ability to discriminate between Thatcherised and typical faces. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Affect can have a significant influence on decision-making processes and subsequent choice. One particularly relevant type of negative affect is anxiety, which serves to enhance responses to threatening stimuli or situations. In its exaggerated form, it can lead to psychiatric disorders, with detrimental consequences for quality of life, including the ability to make choices. This study investigated, for the first time, how pathological anxiety affects risk-taking behavior. In this study, 20 anxious participants meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria for either generalized anxiety disorder (n = 10) and for panic attack disorder (n = 10), as well as 20 matched nonanxious controls, performed a gambling task. To investigate the tendency toward either a risk-seeking or a risk-averse behavior, we employed a task that did not allow for learning from outcomes. Anxious participants made significantly fewer risky choices than matched nonanxious participants. Specifically, they become risk-avoidant after gains. Moreover, anxious participants not only were less happy after gains but were also less sad after losses, and they also evinced less desire to change their choices after losses than did nonanxious participants. Importantly, whereas the desire to switch choice was followed by actual choice switch for all participants, happiness directly predicted subsequent risky choices, particularly in the nonanxious participants. Further analyses revealed that the anxious participants' risk-avoidance behavior was independent of different types of anxiety disorder (panic attack disorder and generalized anxiety disorder) as well as of the effects of psychotropic drugs treatment. This study demonstrates a specific role for anxiety in individual decision making. In particular, hypersensitivity to potential threats and pessimistic evaluation of future events reduced risk-taking behavior. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) involves exploratory learning via rewards and penalties, where most advantageous task performance requires subjects to forego potential large immediate rewards for small longer-term rewards to avoid larger punishments. Pathological gambling (PG) subjects perform worse on the IGT compared to controls, relating to their persistence at high risk decisions involving the continued choice of potential large immediate rewards despite experiencing larger punishments. We wished to determine if neural processing of risk and reward within striatal and frontal cortex is associated with this behaviour observed in PG. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess brain activity in response to a computerized version of the IGT. Thirteen male PG subjects with no active comorbidities were compared to 13 demographically matched control subjects. In agreement with previous behavioural studies, PG subjects performed worse on the IGT and made more high-risk choices compared to controls, particularly after experiencing wins and losses. During high-risk gambling decisions, fMRI demonstrated that PG subjects exhibited relatively increased frontal lobe and basal ganglia activation, particularly involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate and amygdala. Increased activation of regions encompassing the extended reward pathway in PG subjects during high risk choices suggests that the persistence of PG may be due to the increased salience of immediate and greater potential monetary rewards relative to lower monetary rewards or potential future losses. Whether this over activation of the reward pathway is associated with the development of PG warrants further investigation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Surface mining operations can adversely impact the environment. The size and nature of earth-moving works carried out for the exploitation of mineral deposits can cause severe environmental problems unless the mining company plans and implements an effective environmental protection and land reclamation programme. Such a programme starts from the early stages of deposit exploration and continues for many years after the closure of the mine. The type and magnitude of environmental damage associated with surface mining projects are closely related to various site-specific, physical, chemical, ecological, socioeconomic and cultural characteristics, which must be thoroughly identified, analysed and modelled. The goal of this study is to provide decision-makers with information that is necessary for assessing the contribution of a proposed project to national, regional and local development and welfare. Using this approach, project proponents and supervising authorities are able to communicate effectively with public interest groups. Speedy and effective communication between all stakeholders engenders mutual cooperation and collaboration while minimising political damage, all of which will minimise risks that may lead to financial losses or cancellation of the project in its entirely. This article is a review of the main regulatory aspects of public involvement in decision-making involving environmental management of surface mining projects with special emphasis on the Aarhus Convention, an initiative of UN Economic Commission for Europe. The study cites several cases of'contract-based' agreements between mining companies, supervising authorities and the public that have successfully addressed various environmental and socioeconomic issues. Furthermore, this article proposes a methodology for predicting the budget that is required for financing environmental protection and land reclamation works throughout the entire life of the mine, taking into account numerous technical and economic parameters as well as the associated uncertainty. The methodology proposed in this study may be useful during negotiations of environmental management plans for new or for existing mining activities. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We study the effects of deposit insurance and observability of previous actions on the emergence of bank runs by means of a controlled laboratory experiment. We consider three depositors in the line of a bank, who decide between withdrawing or keeping their money deposited. We have three treatments with different levels of deposit insurance which reflect the losses a depositor may incur in the case of a bank run. We find that different levels of deposit insurance and the possibility of observing other depositors' actions affect the likelihood of bank runs. When decisions are not observable, higher levels of deposit insurance decrease the probability of bank runs. When decisions are observable, this need not to be the case. These results suggest that (i) observability might be considered as a partial substitute of deposit insurance and (ii) the optimal deposit insurance should take into account the degree of observability. © 2012 The Ohio State University.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Genetic differences in the dopamine and serotonin systems have been suggested as potential factors underlying interindividual variability in risk taking and in brain activation during the processing of feedback. Here, we studied the effects of dopaminergic (dopamine transporter [DAT1], catecholamine-O-methyltransferase val158met [COMT]) and serotonergic (serotonin transporter [5HTTLPR]) polymorphisms on risk taking and brain responses following feedback in 60 healthy female subjects. The subjects completed a well-established experimental gambling paradigm while an electroencephalogram was recorded. During the task, risk-taking behavior and prefrontal brain responses (feedback-related negativity [FRN]) following monetary gains and losses were assessed. FRN amplitudes were enhanced for nine-repeat-allele carriers of the DAT1 and short-allele carriers of 5HTTLPR, which are both presumably linked to less transporter activity and higher neurotransmitter levels. Moreover, nine-repeat DAT1 carriers displayed a trend toward increased risk taking in general, whereas 5HTTLPR short-allele carriers showed decreased risk taking following gains. COMT val158met genotype was unrelated to FRN amplitude and average risk taking. However, COMT met/met carriers showed a pronounced feedback P3 amplitude independent of valence, and a gradual increase in risk taking during the gambling task. In sum, the present findings underline the importance of genetic variability in the dopamine and serotonin systems regarding the neurophysiology of feedback processing. © The Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Affective forecasting refers to the process of predicting emotional reactions to future events. It plays an important role in decision making, but is also prone to errors, such as the 'impact bias': a tendency to overestimate the intensity of future reactions. The impact bias has been considered evolutionarily adaptive, as it performs a protective function in motivating people to avoid risky behaviour. Affective forecasting may be qualitatively different in a risk-taking population such as problem gamblers (PGs). In particular, PGs may fail to show the impact bias. This study was the first to examine affective forecasting in PGs. PGs (N = 25) and controls (N = 29) were asked to predict how they would feel after completing a guessing task. As hypothesized, controls exaggerated how bad they would feel after losing at the task, whereas PGs accurately predicted their reactions. Encouraging PGs to focus on anticipated emotions may be a novel target for treatment interventions. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Participants in public disability programs face the loss of benefits if they work and earn at substantial levels. Policy makers, researchers, and advocates have suggested that the prospect of benefit loss is, at least in part, an explanation for the low levels of earnings and work participation among disability program participants; however, research on the actual effects is very limited. The authors estimate the prospect of benefit loss effects on work participation and earnings of participants in four disability programs using a unique survey. The findings strongly suggest that the prospect of benefit loss decreases earnings and work participation among disability program participants. Unexpectedly, the authors found little variation in the size of the prospect of benefit loss effects across programs even though there is substantial cross-program variation in the actual benefit loss that occurs with work participation and increased earnings. © 2012 Hammill Institute on Disabilities.\u001b[0m :\n",

I also identify specific aspects of others' deaths that respondents say triggered their own planning.Design and Methods:Data are from the New Jersey End of Life study, a survey of 305 adults age 55+ seeking care at 2 major New Jersey medical centers. I estimate multivariate logistic regression models for a subsample of 253 participants who recently lost a loved one and provide descriptive findings from an open-ended question regarding the motivation for one's ACP.Results:Multivariate analyses revealed \"positive\" role model effects; persons who witnessed significant others' deaths that occurred at home, were free of problems associated with end-of-life care, and where advance directives were used are more likely to make end-of-life preparations. Open-ended data showed that 19% cited others' deaths as the main trigger for their own planning, with most citing negative factors (pain, connection to machines, coma) that they hoped to avoid.Implications:Practitioners should encourage patients to use conversations about others' deaths as springboards for discussions about one's own end-of-life care, and to engage in ACP together with family.

      "Abstract: The feedback negativity (FN), an early neural response that differentiates rewards from losses, appears to be generated in part by reward circuits in the brain. A prominent model of the FN suggests that it reflects learning processes by which environmental feedback shapes behavior. Although there is evidence that human behavior is more strongly influenced by rewards that quickly follow actions, in nonlaboratory settings, optimal behaviors are not always followed by immediate rewards. However, it is not clear how the introduction of a delay between response selection and feedback impacts the FN. Thus, the present study used a simple forced choice gambling task to elicit the FN, in which feedback about rewards and losses was presented after either 1 or 6 s. Results suggest that, at short delays (1 s), participants clearly differentiated losses from rewards, as evidenced in the magnitude of the FN. At long delays (6 s), on the other hand, the difference between losses and rewards was negligible. Results are discussed in terms of eligibility traces and the reinforcement learning model of the FN. © Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In one experiment, we studied risky preferences using a semantic-priming paradigm where accessibility is manipulated independently of beliefs about the frequencies of risky events. We compared the risks taken for precautionary decisions primed by relevant information (enhancing accessibility to relevant events) with those taken for unprimed decisions and decisions primed by irrelevant information. We found that both priming and the subjective frequency of beliefs independently influence decision making. The results indicate that decisions are the result of an integration of influences derived from both the description (specified probability) and experience (accessibility to pre-experiment beliefs about event frequencies and temporarily activated relevant events) of risks. People's risk preferences are influenced by the accessibility of events in memory, such that increasing accessibility causes risk aversion to a potential loss to increase.

First, three elements of risk decision-making in technology innovation activity are studied. They are respectively the state group, the decision group, and the description matrix of utility or losses with different combinations of states and decisions. Second, the approaches of getting changeable market information and utilizing the collected information reasonably are discussed. Finally, the method for revising the original estimated probability and using posterior probability distributions to make new decision are pointed out. It has been found that the repetitive application of this method can help enterprises to carry out dynamic risk management of innovation activities and adapt to the changing market conditions, achieve scientific innovation risk management, and improve economic and social benefits. © right.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine Johnson and Kaplan’s claim that “external reporting influences managerial accounting information” in an emerging capital market, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Design/methodology/approach – The paper relies on a survey instrument and institutional theory analysis in order to: first, explore accountants’ perceptions of the extent to which financial accounting conventions-based information is utilized, instead of managerial accounting information, in internal decision making; and second, articulate respondents’ perception to the UAE’s wider social and institutional context expressed in terms of accounting regulars, accountancy profession and partnership with multinational companies. Findings – In line with Johnson and Kaplan’s claim and contrary to the studies of Hopper et al., Joseph et al. and Scapens et al., the paper’s findings show evidence of financial reporting domination on managerial accounting information in the UAE. Locating such results in a UAE companies social and institutional context, the paper reveals that the activities of regulators and accountancy professionals pay more attention to financial reporting, an issue which contributes towards reinforcing respondents’ general perceptions that management accounting is subservient to the demands of financial reporting requirements. Research limitations/implications – Although the paper’s findings trigger the importance of the UAE’s institutional context in reinforcing accountants’ perceptions, the interaction between financial accounting requirements and managerial accounting information is an area that needs further in-depth case-study-based investigation in emerging market economies. Practical implications – The paper’s findings highlight the type of information that UAE’s managers utilize when making decisions. These findings are in the interest of business investors and the accountancy profession that aims at increasing practitioners’ professional knowledge. Originality/value – This is one of few papers that combine survey results and institutional theory analysis to explore whether financial accounting dominates managerial accounting information and, at the same time, provides an understanding of the underlying reasons behind that domination in an emerging market economy such as the UAE. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

IEL was divided into indirect economic loss due to the disruption of production process (IEL I) and indirect economic loss induced by the disturbance of industrial lines (IEL II). An input-output model was used to assess these two types of IEL. The study showed that (1) developed regions may be more vulnerable with respect to IEL; (2) IEL II is the primary factor contributing to total IEL; (3) decision makers need to focus on IEL II beside IEL I which is usually the main disaster-reduction target after a disaster; and (4) tradeoff between economic growth and disaster prevention is needed to achieve regional sustainable development. © Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Autonomous agents may encapsulate their principals' personal data attributes. These attributes may be disclosed to other agents during agent interactions, producing a loss of privacy. Thus, agents need self-disclosure decision-making mechanisms to autonomously decide whether disclosing personal data attributes to other agents is acceptable or not. Current self-disclosure decision-making mechanisms consider the direct benefit and the privacy loss of disclosing an attribute. However, there are many situations in which the direct benefit of disclosing an attribute is a priori unknown. This is the case in human relationships, where the disclosure of personal data attributes plays a crucial role in their development. In this paper, we present self-disclosure decision-making mechanisms based on psychological findings regarding how humans disclose personal information in the building of their relationships. We experimentally demonstrate that, in most situations, agents following these decision-making mechanisms lose less privacy than agents that do not use them. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

In the context of infrastructure development at national parks and other protected areas in rural regions, the preferences of both local residents and non-local citizens and visitors are important. These preferences may diverge due to differing attitudes toward utilization of natural resources, as well as differences in desired tourism experiences and other factors. This study utilized CE and mixed logit modeling to account for unobserved heterogeneity while assessing local versus non-local preferences for development of a gondola adjacent to a national park in rural Norway. Results indicate observable heterogeneity in local and non-local preferences for food and information provision, but commonality in preferences for the gondola in general and for avoiding loss of wild reindeer habitat. They also indicate unobserved heterogeneity in local preferences for gondola development, as well as in preferences for avoiding habitat loss among respondents generally. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Participants: The participants were 23 mid-life redundant white collar workers with at least eight years in their sector, organization or occupation. The selected interviewees either participated in training to broaden their professional competence or did not make any such 'expansive' efforts. Methods: The study was based on narrative interviews, which enabled a detailed cross case examination of individuals' actions and choices and how the process unfolds over time. Results: The results showed that people treat their job loss as a practical problem to be solved using various strategies. This problem-solving process is structured, with people passing similar crossroads defining particular challenges and opportunities giving people limited sets of choices.

      "Abstract: The tri-reference point (TRP) theory takes into account minimum requirements (MR), the status quo (SQ), and goals (G) in decision making under risk. The 3 reference points demarcate risky outcomes and risk perception into 4 functional regions: success (expected value of x ≥ G), gain (SQ < × < G), loss (MR ≤ x < SQ), and failure (x < MR). The psychological impact of achieving or failing to achieve these reference points is rank ordered as MR > G > SQ. We present TRP assumptions and value functions and a mathematical formalization of the theory. We conducted empirical tests of crucial TRP predictions using both explicit and implicit reference points. We show that decision makers consider both G and MR and give greater weight to MR than G, indicating failure aversion (i.e., the disutility of a failure is greater than the utility of a success in the same task) in addition to loss aversion (i.e., the disutility of a loss is greater than the utility of the same amount of gain). Captured by a double-S shaped value function with 3 inflection points, risk preferences switched between risk seeking and risk aversion when the distribution of a gamble straddled a different reference point. The existence of MR (not G) significantly shifted choice preference toward risk aversion even when the outcome distribution of a gamble was well above the MR. Single reference point based models such as prospect theory cannot consistently account for these findings. The TRP theory provides simple guidelines for evaluating risky choices for individuals and organizational management. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

We employed a six question survey, considering real life investment decisions, stock trend predictability and preference toward risk investments, and three hypothetic scenarios to measure the participants' risk attitudes in the area of finance. The results showed that trait anger predicted risky decisions: it was positively associated with the willingness to invest money in different kinds of stocks, preferring medium/long-term investments, and with high predictability assessment in the forecast of stock trends. Contrarily, trait anxiety predicted conservative financial decisions: it was associated with the decision not to invest savings, to hold interest-bearing accounts, and with low predictability of stock trends. In hypothetic scenarios trait anger predicted a medium risk portfolio and the decision to wait before selling both loss and gain investments, while trait anxiety was associated with the preference for a low risk portfolio and with the decision to immediately sell a stock both if it increases or decreases in value. These data are consistent with cognitive models of emotions, highlighting their functional utility and extend the knowledge of the relationship between personality traits and real life investment decision-making. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study, the first on the impact of a WalMart in a large city, draws on three annual surveys of enterprises within a four-mile radius of a new Chicago WalMart. It shows that the probability of going out of business was significantly higher for establishments close to that store. This probability fell off at a rate of 6% per mile in all directions. Using this relationship, we estimate that WalMart's opening resulted in the loss of approximately 300 full-time equivalent jobs in nearby neighborhoods. This loss about equals WalMart's own employment in the area. Our analysis of separate data on sales tax receipts shows that after its opening there was no net increase in retail sales in WalMart's own and surrounding zip codes. Overall, these results support the contention that large-city WalMarts, like those in small towns, absorb retail sales from nearby stores without significantly expanding the market. © The Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: New Zealand faces a choice between environmental improvement and dairy industry profitability and employment, since improved water quality in lakes and rivers may require measures that will reduce net farm profit. Environmental valuation studies often consider preferences for employment but rarely focus specifically on the effect of job losses on respondent preferences for environmental improvement. A choice experiment was used to investigate people's willingness to pay for water quality improvements in a typical dairy catchment in the Waikato region of New Zealand. It was found that respondents would be willing to pay for water that is safer for swimming with improvements in clarity and ecological health, but are concerned about job losses, even when they do not expect to be directly affected. This may be explained by the concept of sociality, whereby the influence of direct interpersonal interaction on human behaviour, affects choice behaviour. Findings from this study and ongoing research should allow decision makers to consider both the costs and the benefits of different levels of water quality improvements, so allowing policy makers to identify the most cost effective options for achieving any given improvement in water quality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background This study used a qualitative approach to comprehend how the morbid obese conceptualize and deal with obesity and obesity treatment, with the particular aim of exploring the expectations and beliefs about the exigencies and the impact of bariatric surgery. Methods The study population included 30 morbid obese patients (20 women and 10 men) with a mean age of 39.17 years (SD08.81) and a mean body mass index of 47.5 (SD08.2) (reviewer #2, comment #9) interviewed individually before surgery using open-ended questions. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and then coded according to grounded analysis methodology. Results Three main thematic areas emerged from the data: obesity, eating behavior, and treatment. Obesity is described as a stable and hereditary trait. Although participants recognize that personal eating behavior exacerbates this condition, patients see their eating behavior as difficult to change and control. Food seems to be an ever-present dimension and a coping strategy, and to follow an adequate diet plan is described as a huge sacrifice. Bariatric surgery emerges as the only treatment for obesity, and participants highlight this moment as the beginning of a new life where health professionals have the main role. Bariatric surgery candidates see their eating behavior as out of their control, and to commit to its demands is seen as a big sacrifice. For these patients, surgery is understood as a miracle moment that will change their lives without requiring an active role or their participation. Conclusion According to these results, it is necessary to validate them with qualitative and quantitative studies (reviewer #2, comment #3); it is necessary to promote a new awareness of the weight loss process and to empower patients before and after bariatric surgery. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Strength of handedness, or the degree to which an individual prefers to use a single hand to perform various tasks, is a neurological marker for brain organization and has been shown to be linked to episodic memory, attribute framing, and anchoring, as well as other domains and tasks. The present work explores the relationship of handedness to both inaction inertia (the inclination to resist an action after previously bypassing a similar action) as well as to the sunk cost effect (the tendency to continue to engage in a behavior after an initial investment of time or money has been made). In Experiment 1, mixed-handers displayed a larger inaction inertia effect than strong-handers. In Experiment 2, they displayed a larger sunk cost effect than strong-handers. Experiments 3 and 4 extended the sunk cost finding into a different domain and explored how mixed- and strong-handers react to additional information designed to increase the comparative advantage of terminating, rather than continuing, a failed project. Overall, we found that mixed-handers were more likely to show inertia effects because of an increased aversion to losses. The results of Experiment 4 suggest that, when provided with additional information that made it clear that continuing a project would be a greater loss than terminating it, mixed-handers no longer showed a larger sunk cost effect than strong-handers, highlighting the importance of carefully considering exactly how sunk cost scenarios are worded and providing additional information on how mixed- and strong-handers differ in belief updating. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: Framing a message in terms of the benefits of engaging in the behavior (gain frame), the costs of failing to engage in the behavior (loss frame), or both the benefits and the costs (mixed frame) can impact parents' decisions about their childrens' and adolescents' health. This study, investigated the effect of framed messages on parents' intentions to have their children vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV). Design and Sample: The study employed a 2 (gender of the parent) × 2 (gender of the child) × 3 (message frame) between-groups, quasi-experimental design. A convenience sample of 367 parents with children in Grade 5, 6, or 7 who had at least one child who had not been vaccinated against HPV. Measures: Social-cognitive variables relating to intentions to vaccinate a child were assessed. Intervention: Participants were randomly assigned to read one of three framed messages about the HPV vaccine (gain, loss, or mixed). Results: Gain-framed messages seemed to persuade mothers of sons to speak to a doctor about the vaccine (p < .05). Framing effects were not significant for other outcomes. Conclusions: Findings provide preliminary evidence that certain vaccination messages may be more effective for different parent-child dyads. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) dysfunction and poor decision making have been described in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse. These neurobiological underpinnings might explain dependency-like behaviors often described in this condition, such as loss of control over painkillers, high rates of relapse after detoxification, and compromised social functioning. We investigate whether the OFC impairment was a persistent trait in migraine, independent of clinical and affective features, a dynamic result of the need to cope with the increased pain and disability, or a temporary consequence of medication overuse. Methods For this purpose, we compared 40 chronic migraineurs with medication overuse, 40 episodic migraineurs, and 40 matched healthy controls. The examination consisted of a clinical interview, Anxiety and Depression Hamilton Scales, Severity of Dependence Scale, and Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire. A neuropsychological assessment of orbitofrontal function was made through the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Chronic migraineurs with medication overuse were followed for a year after detoxification. Results We found an impaired decision-making performance among chronic and episodic migraineurs that seems independent of the patients' clinical and affective status. Contrary to the psychiatric and clinical improvement shown 1 year after the detox, CM patients exhibited a persistent IGT deficit. No significant differences in OFC functioning were found between the CM patients who relapsed into medication overuse after detox and those who did not. Conclusions The present findings suggest the presence of a persistent OFC dysfunction in migraine as a psychobiologic trait that is not influenced by the presence of medication overuse, the clinical severity of the disease, or the patient's affective status. Further studies are needed to elucidate the etiopathological role of OFC in migraine and medication overuse. © 2012 American Headache Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article investigates the impacts of globalization processes on community resilience. It argues that theoretical concepts such as transition theory can provide a lens through which resilience pathways at community level can be better understood, and proposes a framework focused on a social resilience approach for understanding community resilience as the conceptual space at the intersection between economic, social and environmental capital. It argues that certain types of communities are losing resilience through increased embeddedness into globalized pathways of decision-making, while other communities may be gaining resilience, although not one system is either totally resilient or totally vulnerable. Striking the right 'balance' between communities and their scalar interactions with the global level is key for maximization of community resilience: while too much isolation of a community may be bad in light of over-dependency on local resources, skills and people, 'over-globalization', with possible loss of autonomy and identity, may be equally fraught with problems. In particular, relocalized communities have, so far, not shown much tangible success, as almost all members of the relocalization process at community level are simultaneously embedded within the global capitalist system through their dependencies on global economic processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Decision making (DM) in the context of others often entails complex cognition-emotion interaction. While the literature suggests that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and amygdala are involved in valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing, how these neural mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and emotional values in a social context remains unclear. In this study we addressed this gap by systematically manipulating cognition-emotion interaction in a social DM context, when the participants played a card game with a hypothetical opponent in a behavioral study (n = 73) and a functional magnetic-resonance-imaging study (n = 16). We observed that payoff-based behavioral choices were influenced by emotional values carried by face pictures and identified neurocircuits involved in cognitive valuation, emotional valuation, and concurrent cognition-emotion value integration. Specifically, while the vmPFC, amygdala, and ventral striatum were all involved in both cognitive and emotional domains of valuation, these regions played dissociable roles in social DM. The payoff-dependent responses in vmPFC and amygdala, but not ventral striatum, were moderated by the social context. Furthermore, the vmPFC, but not amygdala, not only encoded the opponent's gains as if self's losses, but also represented a \"final common currency\" during valuation-based decisions. The extent to which emotional input influenced choices was associated with the functional connectivity between the value-signaling amygdala and value integrating vmPFC, and also with the functional connectivity between the context-setting hippocampus and value-signaling amygdala and ventral striatum. These results identify brain pathways through which emotion shapes subjective values in a social DM context. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Research has demonstrated that broad HEXACO personality dimensions predict domain-specific risk-taking (Weller & Tikir, 2011). We extend this research by testing the degree to which HEXACO dimensions, especially the Honesty-Humility dimension, differentially predicted risk preferences as a function of whether the decision was presented as a potential gain or loss. In a university sample (n= 231), participants completed the HEXACO-PI-R (Lee & Ashton, 2004) and a risky decision-making task of choices involving either potential gains or potential losses. We found that HEXACO dimensions differentially predicted risk-taking as a function of the outcome valence. Specifically, Honesty-Humility was associated with greater risk-taking for both domains. Emotionality was associated with less risk-taking in both domains. In contrast, low Conscientiousness was only associated with greater risk-taking to achieve gains. These results help to further demonstrate the utility of assessing the Honesty-Humility dimension, as well as to illuminate potential underlying mechanisms associated with increased risk-taking in individuals reporting lower Honesty-Humility. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Study design: Grounded theory. Objectives: To explore to better understand the decision-making process of people with tetraplegia regarding reconstructive upper limb (UL) surgery.Setting:New Zealand. Methods: In-depth interviews with 22 people with tetraplegia, 10 of whom had UL surgery and 12 had not. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using constructivist grounded theory. Results: The primary reason for having reconstructive UL surgery was to improve independence and return to previous pastimes. Reasons not to have surgery were hope for further recovery or cure, and inadequate physical environment or social supports while rehabilitating. In addition, women identified the temporary loss of independence and need for increased care while rehabilitating as issues. Importantly, these issues were not static, often changing in importance or relevance over time.Conclusions:The moment of making the decision for reconstructive UL surgery is elusive; therefore, multiple offers of surgery at different timeframes in an individual's life are required. In addition, flexibility in timing for surgery would allow for surgery to better coordinate with an individual's goals and priorities. © 2012 International Spinal Cord Society All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: As one of the co-authors of the first academic research papers published in a major accounting research journal on the subject of the balanced scorecard, the author was asked to reflect on his experiences with research in this area over the last 12 years since that first paper was published. The purpose of this paper is to do this through personal reflection and a literature review. Employing personal reflection and a literature review, the author examines three issues: what motivated him to start this research program; the way the research program unfolded and its unintended consequences; and finally some reflections on the academic research enterprise as it is practised in North America that are reflected by the unintended consequences. The author looks at the differences in psychology research traditions and how they shaped the research program on the balanced scorecard into an attempt to “debias” a problem rather than to bring strong human information processing theory to bear on how the scorecard dealt with some of the issues in its application. The author suggests that these different focuses explain how management accounting behavioral researchers lost an opportunity to have greater impact in the development of this performance tool. The paper questions and documents limitations that arise from the reliance on an underlying psychology paradigm that focuses on human limitations, rather than one focused on aiding humans to perform better. It suggests that greater research contributions in management accounting could be obtained if more researchers focused on how management accounting information can be developed that takes advantage of human information processing strengths. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

We find that subjects took more risk than planned in their initial bet and after losses. In addition, this increased risk was associated with an increase in breakeven mental accounting.

      "Abstract: Commercial transplantation has expanded because of the shortage of kidneys for transplantation. This study aims to synthesize qualitative studies on the experiences and perspectives of living commercial kidney donors. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases to April 2011 and consulted experts to identify unpublished studies. Thematic synthesis was used to analyze the findings. Seven studies involving over 676 commercial kidney donors were included. Three major themes were identified: desperation (the participants' decision to sell their kidney was forced by poverty, debt, or to fulfill a family obligation); despair (destroyed body integrity, shame and secrecy, dehumanized and dispirited, loss of livelihood, heightened sense of vulnerability, disappointment, and regret); and debasement (deception by brokers and recipients, victimized by the hospital, stigmatized by community, and rejected by family). Commercial kidney transplantation is reported to result in ramifications for the donors' mental, physical, and social well-being. Not only do they remain in poverty, they lose dignity, sense of purpose, respect, relationships, and livelihood. Review of this published literature supports the need for effective implementation of the WHO guiding principles and legislated regulation to deter potential recipients and healthcare providers from pursuing commercial transplantation. © 2012 The Authors.

      "Abstract: Humans involved in cooperative interactions willingly pay a cost to punish cheats. However, the proximate motives underpinning punitive behaviour are currently debated. Individuals who interact with cheats experience losses, but they also experience lower payoffs than the cheating partner. Thus, the negative emotions that trigger punishment may stem from a desire to reciprocate losses or from inequity aversion. Previous studies have not disentangled these possibilities. Here, we use an experimental approach to ask whether punishment is motivated by inequity aversion or by a desire for reciprocity. We show that humans punish cheats only when cheating produces disadvantageous inequity, while there is no evidence for reciprocity. This finding challenges the notion that punishment is motivated by a simple desire to reciprocally harm cheats and shows that victims compare their own payoffs with those of partners when making punishment decisions. © 2012 The Royal Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper applies probability and decision theory in the graphical interface of an influence diagram to study the formal requirements of rationality which justify the individualization of a person found through a database search. The decision-theoretic part of the analysis studies the parameters that a rational decision maker would use to individualize the selected person. The modeling part (in the form of an influence diagram) clarifies the relationships between this decision and the ingredients that make up the database search problem, i.e., the results of the database search and the different pairs of propositions describing whether an individual is at the source of the crime stain. These analyses evaluate the desirability associated with the decision of 'individualizing' (and 'not individualizing'). They point out that this decision is a function of (i) the probability that the individual in question is, in fact, at the source of the crime stain (i.e., the state of nature), and (ii) the decision maker's preferences among the possible consequences of the decision (i.e., the decision maker's loss function). We discuss the relevance and argumentative implications of these insights with respect to recent comments in specialized literature, which suggest points of view that are opposed to the results of our study. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Adolescents engage in a wide range of risky behaviors that their older peers shun, and at an enormous cost. Despite being older, stronger, and healthier than children, adolescents face twice the risk of mortality and morbidity faced by their younger peers. Are adolescents really risk-seekers or does some richer underlying preference drive their love of the uncertain? To answer that question, we used standard experimental economic methods to assess the attitudes of 65 individuals ranging in age from 12 to 50 toward risk and ambiguity. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that adolescents were, if anything, more averse to clearly stated risks than their older peers. What distinguished adolescents was their willingness to accept ambiguous conditions-situations in which the likelihood of winning and losing is unknown. Though adults find ambiguous monetary lotteries undesirable, adolescents find them tolerable. This finding suggests that the higher level of risk-taking observed among adolescents may reflect a higher tolerance for the unknown. Biologically, such a tolerance may make sense, because it would allow young organisms to take better advantage of learning opportunities; it also suggests that policies that seek to inform adolescents of the risks, costs, and benefits of unexperienced dangerous behaviors may be effective and, when appropriate, could be used to complement policies that limit their experiences.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Surgical treatment options for meralgia paresthetica include neurolysis and neurectomy procedures. Reported success rates for pain relief are generally higher after neurectomy, but an obvious disadvantage compared with neurolysis is the loss of sensation in the anterolateral part of the thigh. In this study we analyzed our results on pain relief after both procedures, and we determined the impact of loss of sensation with a questionnaire. Methods: Between 1999 and 2009, all patients with persistent symptoms of meralgia paresthetica who presented to our clinic after failure of conservative treatment were offered a neurectomy procedure. After this period, the surgical strategy was changed to first neurolysis followed by neurectomy in case of failure. We retrospectively analyzed our results for both strategies with a questionnaire that was focused on pain relief, numbness and the impact of numbness. Results: Ten patients underwent a neurolysis with a 60 % pain relief rate compared to 87.5 % of the eight patients that primarily underwent a neurectomy. Most neurectomy patients (62.5 %) were not hindered by the numbness, 25 % sometimes and only one patient was frequently bothered, but was still satisfied with the outcome. The failures of neurolysis were secondarily treated by neurectomy, which resulted in pain relief in three out of four patients. Conclusions: This series confirms previous reports in the literature that have shown higher success rates for the neurectomy procedure. In addition, it shows that most patients are not bothered by the numbness following this procedure. These observations can be used in the surgical decision making for meralgia paresthetica. © Springer-Verlag 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In 1949-1950, Britain rejected ideas of being a third force between the post-war Superpowers and adopted instead an approach that has been the keystone of British foreign policy from that point onwards: \"hugging America close.\" The aspiration was to establish a position closely related to the United States yet sufficiently independent, effectively to harness American power to British ends. This now familiar position has been much-debated recently in the context of post-9/11 military interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan especially. However, this analysis examines three crises immediately following the British decision in 1949-1950 to give priority to the Anglo-American \"special relationship\" to demonstrate that, for Britain, this policy from the onset was both advantageous and potentially difficult. The outcomes of crises over NATO's Atlantic Command, Iranian oil, and ANZUS demonstrate how expansion of United States influence benefitted Britain but sometimes also required painful British adjustment and loss of prestige. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Since Bechara et al. pioneered its development, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely applied to elucidate decision behavior and medial prefrontal function. Although most decision makers can hunch the final benefits of IGT, ventromedial prefrontal lesions generate a myopic choice pattern. Additionally, the Iowa group developed a revised IGT (inverted IGT, iIGT) to confirm the IGT validity. Each iIGT trial was generated from the trial of IGT by multiplying by a \"-\" to create an inverted monetary value. Thus, bad decks A and B in the IGT become good decks iA and iB in the iIGT; additionally, good decks C and D in the IGT become bad decks iC and iD in the iIGT. Furthermore, IGT possessed mostly the gain trials, and iIGT possessed mainly the loss trials. Therefore, IGT is a frequent-gain-based task, and iIGT is a frequent-loss-based task. However, a growing number of IGT-related studies have identified confounding factors in IGT (i.e., gain-loss frequency), which are demonstrated by the prominent deck B phenomenon (PDB phenomenon). Nevertheless, the mirrored PDB phenomenon and guiding power of gain-loss frequency in iIGT have seldom been reexamined. This experimental finding supports the prediction based on gain-loss frequency. This study identifies the mirrored PDB phenomenon. Frequent small losses override occasional large gains in deck iB of the iIGT. Learning curve analysis generally supports the phenomenon based on gain-loss frequency rather than final outcome. In terms of iIGT and simple versions of iIGT, results of this study demonstrate that high-frequency loss, rather than a satisfactory final outcome, dominates the preference of normal decision makers under uncertainty. Furthermore, normal subjects prefer \"no immediate punishment\" rather than \"final reward\" under uncertainty. © 2012 Lin et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

Today with respect to role and importance of commercial ports in economy, the ports are trying to increase their operational capacity through satisfaction of customer and attracting ship lines investors, the owner of goods and ports by making value added services. True understanding of all components of marketing particularly about important role of customers, is a positive step towards success and efficacy of marketing. But what is called risk of ports actually is the danger of customers loss, current customers' loss and not attracting of new customer the use and applying of risk management techniques as well as ICT and IT systems have plenty of effect on planning and decision making in multilateral environment. IT has increasingly been effecting on function and efficacy of organizations, public and private firms. Today the use of IT in risk management has an impact on kind of organizing automation activities in organizations and managing the cycle of making mechanical systems. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Dual-process theories have suggested that emotion plays a key role in the framing effect in decision-making. However, little is known about the potential impact of a specific positive or negative emotional context on this bias. We investigated this question with adult participants using an emotional priming paradigm. First, participants were presented with positive or negative affective pictures (i.e., pleasant vs. unpleasant photographs). Afterward, participants had to perform a financial decision-making task that was unrelated to the pictures previously presented. The results revealed that the presentation framed in terms of gain or loss no longer affected subjects' decision-making following specific exposure to emotionally pleasant pictures. Interestingly, a positive emotional context did not globally influence risk-taking behavior but specifically decreased the risk propensity in the loss frame. This finding confirmed that a positive emotional context can reduce loss aversion, and it strongly reinforced the dual-process view that the framing effect stems from an affective heuristic belonging to intuitive System 1. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Sex is constructed as an important (even essential) part of 'normal' adult functioning, and for men in particular. While sexual abstinence may often be valued among adolescents, 'celibacy' among adults is considered problematic, associated with losses in health, well-being and general quality of life. Despite this, for various reasons, some people choose to deliberately avoid sexual activity (often conflated with coitus) with another person, even though they might continue to desire it. This article presents interview data detailing nine men's accounts of their choice to be 'celibate' or deliberately giving up sex for a period of time. Using thematic analysis, it presents two primary themes. First, that sex (despite the choice to be celibate) is still an imperative, and second, that celibacy becomes necessary as sex itself can be constructed as a problem. The analysis also examines how accounts of 'choice' and 'control' are used to define celibacy as a form of resistance to the power of the male sex-drive discourse, and yet simultaneously build upon hegemonic forms of masculine sense making such as a self-control, autonomy, and in some cases outright misogyny. © The Author(s) 2012 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We study the behavioural foundation of interdependent preferences, where the outcomes of others affect the welfare of the decision maker. These preferences are taken as given, not derived from more primitive ones. Our aim is to establish an axiomatic foundation providing the link between observation of choices and a functional representation which is convenient, free of inconsistencies and can provide the basis for measurement. The dependence among preferences may take place in two conceptually different ways, expressing two different views of the nature of interdependent preferences. The first is Festinger's view that the evaluation of peers' outcomes is useful to improve individual choices by learning from the comparison. The second is Veblen's view that interdependent preferences keep track of social status derived from a social value attributed to the goods one consumes. Corresponding to these two different views, we have two different formulations. In the first, the decision maker values his outcomes and those of others on the basis of his own utility. In the second, he ranks outcomes according to a social value function. We give different axiomatic foundations to these two different, but complementary, views of the nature of the interdependence. On the basis of this axiomatic foundation, we build a behavioural theory of comparative statics within subjects and across subjects. We characterize preferences according to the relative importance assigned to gains and losses in social domain, that is pride and envy. This parallels the standard analysis of private gains and losses (as well as that of regret and relief). We give an axiomatic foundation of interpersonal comparison of preferences, ordering individuals according to their sensitivity to social ranking. These characterizations provide the behavioural foundation for applied analysis of market and game equilibria with interdependent preferences. © The Author 2012.

      "Abstract: This study estimates the benefits that Indian farmers derive from market and weather information delivered to their mobile phones by a commercial service called Reuters Market Light (RML). We conduct a controlled randomized experiment in 100 villages of Maharashtra. Treated farmers associate RML information with a number of decisions they have made, and we find some evidence that treatment affected spatial arbitrage and crop grading. But the magnitude of these effects is small. We find no statistically significant average effect of treatment on the price received by farmers, crop value-added, crop losses resulting from rainstorms, or the likelihood of changing crop varieties and cultivation practices. Although disappointing, these results are in line with the market take-up rate of the RML service in the study districts, which shows small numbers of clients in aggregate and a relative stagnation in take-up over the study period. © The Author 2012.

      "Abstract: In eight studies, we tested the prediction that making choices for others involves less loss aversion than making choices for the self. We found that loss aversion is significantly lessened among people choosing for others in scenarios describing riskless choice (Study 1), gambling (Studies 2 and 3), and social aspects of life, such as likeably and status (Studies 4a-e). Moreover, we found this pattern in relatively realistic conditions where people are rewarded for making desirable (i.e., profitable) choices for others (Study 2), when the other for whom a choice is made is physically present (Study 3), and when real money is at stake (Studies 2 and 3). Finally, we found loss aversion is moderated when factors associated with self-other differences in decision making are taken into account, such as decision makers' construal level (Study 4a), regulatory focus (Study 4b), degree of information seeking (Study 4c), omission bias (Study 4d), and power (Study 4e). © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Converging developmental decision-making studies have demonstrated that until late adolescence, individuals prefer options for which the risk of a loss is low regardless of the final outcome. Recent works have shown a similar inability to consider both loss frequency and final outcome among adults. The current study aimed to identify developmental changes in feedback-monitoring ability to consider both loss frequency and final outcome in decision making under ambiguity. Children, adolescents, and adults performed an adapted version of the Soochow Gambling Task. Our results showed that children and adolescents presented an exclusive preference for options associated with infrequent punishment. In contrast, only adults seemed to consider both loss frequency and the final outcome by favoring the advantageous options when the frequency of losses was low. These findings suggest that the ability to integrate both loss frequency and final outcome develops with age. Moreover, the analysis of strategic adjustments following gains and losses reveals that adults switch less often after losses compared with children and adolescents. This finding suggests that psychological tolerance to loss may facilitate learning the characteristics of each option and improve the ability to choose advantageously. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present study aimed to explore specific personality traits that affect risky choices by using a relatively novel computerised card game, the Columbia Card Task, to dissociate the processes of emotional decision making (i.e., the Hot version of the task) and deliberative decision making (i.e., the Cold version). Participants were administered either the Hot or the Cold version of the task together with standard measures of personality traits that were hypothesised to be involved in completing the task (i.e., Sensation Seeking, Impulsivity, Sensitivity to Reward and Punishment). The results of the deliberative Cold version of the task revealed that participants who scored highly on the Impulsivity trait engaged in riskier decision-making. Participants who scored highly on the Reward Responsiveness trait were found to be sensitive to variations in gains and losses in the emotional Hot version of the task. These findings enhance the existing knowledge of risky decision-making by suggesting that personality traits can differentially alter decision-making behaviours due to interactions with the decision-making context. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In green logistics operation, all logistics processes form a bidirectional closed-loop topology. In order to model and optimize such a kind of structure, a standardized closed-loop logistics operation reference model is built which aims to provide supply chain managers with general analysis. Based on the reference model, potential risks of closed-loop logistics chain can be analyzed including not only the visible forward and reverse logistics flow but also the invisible information flow. A qualitative decision-making model for different logistics organizations under risk is proposed and a profit function is developed according to logistics management decision-making process of all logistics nodes under different risks. The proposed model considers different risk management strategy problems. The optimization problem is described as a multi-objective decision-making problem with minimization of the risk loss as well as risk management cost and maximization of the profit. The profit model is solved by genetic algorithm. In the model, in order to express uncertainties of different risk preference information, risk is assessed by a three-dimensional vector in priority, probability and loss. A quantified reference model is introduced through a three-dimensional vague vector map, where several information gathering methods based on vague set are discussed and compared through a case study. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

In Experiment 1, participants observed 75 choices that had been made by controls or patients in previous research, followed by memory tests, and then 25 active choices from the participant. In Experiment 2, participants made choices for 75 trials, performed the memory tests, and then made 25 final choices.

      "Abstract: Methylphenidate (MPH) is a stimulant that increases extracellular levels of dopamine and noradrenaline. It can diminish risky decisionmaking tendencies in certain clinical populations. MPH is also used, without license, by healthy adults, but the impact on their decisionmaking is not well established. Previous work has found that dopamine receptor activity of healthy adults can modulate the influence of stake magnitude on decisions to persistently gamble after incurring a loss. In this study, we tested for modulation of this effect by MPH in 40 healthy human adults. In a double-blind experiment, 20 subjects received 20 mg of MPH, while 20 matched controls received a placebo. All were provided with 30 rounds of opportunities to accept an incurred loss from their assets or opt for a \"double-or-nothing\" gamble that would either avoid or double it. Rounds began with a variable loss that would double with every failed gamble until it was accepted, recovered, or reached a specified maximum. Probability of recovery on any gamble was low and ambiguous. Subjects receiving placebo gambled less as the magnitude of the stake was raised and as the magnitude of accumulated loss escalated over the course of the task. In contrast, subjects treated with MPH gambled at a consistent rate, well above chance, across all stakes and trials. Trait reward responsiveness also reduced the impact of high stakes. The findings suggest that elevated catecholamine activity by MPH can disrupt inhibitory influences on persistent risky choice in healthy adults. © 2012 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Outcome uncertainty plays an important role in decision making. The present study used event-related potentials (ERP) combined with a simple gambling task to investigate the time course of outcome uncertainty processing in the gain and the loss domains. Behaviorally, participants showed a preference for the uncertain option in the gain domain, whereas they showed no such preference in the loss domain. In ERP analyses, the feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitudes mirrored the behavioral results: for gains, cue-elicited FRN amplitudes were more negative for uncertain than for certain cues, whereas for losses, cue-elicited FRN amplitudes for certain cues and uncertain cues were not different. In contrast, the P300 amplitude was sensitive to the valence of cues (gains or losses) but not to the uncertainty of the outcome. These results suggest that the outcome uncertainty is rapidly and differentially processed in the gain and loss domains. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Colors are widely present in the financial decision making arena: at firms' and data providers' websites; television reports; newspaper publications; advertizements; security market displays, with colors such as red and green prominently employed. Our experimental analysis involves a between subject design exposing subjects to financial substance on colored backgrounds and exploring the effect on their investment decisions. We focus on financial decisions under uncertainty about probability, examining subjects' investment valuations and the probabilities they assign to the possible outcomes. This study explores the role of color exposure as a priming factor in financial decision making. Priming is a process of activating particular connections or associations in memory prior to carrying out an action or task. The associations occur when a certain stimulus or event increases the availability of specific information categories and, as a result, affect decision making. The results indicate that red color priming emphasizes value losses of the underlying asset. To wit, subjects who were exposed to red (R) assigned higher valuations and probabilities to events involving the loss domain, than to events involving the gain domain, relatively to the valuations assigned by subjects who were exposed to green (G). The aggregated evaluation given by the R subjects when the investment payback was subject to negative (positive) underlying asset returns was higher (lower) than that of the G subjects by roughly 15% (19%) of the invested amount. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: The burden of residential fire injury and death is substantial. Targeted smoke alarm giveaway and installation programs are popular interventions used to reduce residential fire mortality and morbidity. Purpose: To evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost benefit of implementing a giveaway or installation program in a small hypothetic community with a high risk of fire death and injury through a decision-analysis model. Methods: Model inputs included program costs; program effectiveness (life-years and quality-adjusted life-years saved); and monetized program benefits (medical cost, productivity, property loss and quality-of-life losses averted) and were identified through structured reviews of existing literature (done in 2011) and supplemented by expert opinion. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. All costs were expressed in 2011 U.S. dollars. Results: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) resulted in an average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) of $51,404 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved and $45,630 per QALY for the giveaway and installation programs, respectively. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) showed that both programs were associated with a positive net benefit with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.1 and 2.3, respectively. Smoke alarm functional rate, baseline prevalence of functional alarms, and baseline home fire death rate were among the most influential factors for the CEA and CBA results. Conclusions: Both giveaway and installation programs have an average cost-effectiveness ratio similar to or lower than the median cost-effectiveness ratio reported for other interventions to reduce fatal injuries in homes. Although more effort is required, installation programs result in lower cost per outcome achieved compared with giveaways.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Individuals with depressive symptoms typically show deficits in decision-making. However, most work has emphasized decision-making under gain-maximization conditions. A gain-maximization framework may undermine decision-making when depressive symptoms are present because depressives are generally more sensitive to losses than gains. The present study examined decision making in a non-clinical sample of depressive and non-depressive individuals under gain-maximization or loss-minimization conditions using a task for which the currently available rewards depend upon participants' previous history of choices. As predicted, we found a cross over interaction whereby depressive individuals were superior to non-depressive individuals under loss-minimization conditions, but were inferior to non-depressive individuals under gain-maximization conditions. In addition, we found that loss-minimization performance was superior to gain-maximization performance for depressive individuals, but that gain-maximization performance was superior to loss-minimization performance for non-depressive individuals. These results suggest that decision making deficits observed when depressive symptoms are present may be attenuated when decisions involve minimizing losses rather than maximizing gains. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Because of early detection and advanced treatment options, more women with breast cancer survive after mastectomy and thus have to face the choice of living with or without a reconstructed breast for many years to come. Objective: This article investigates these women's narratives about the impact of mastectomy on their lives, as well as their reflections on breast reconstruction. Methods: Fifteen women were strategically chosen from a previous population-based study on mastectomy. They were contacted for further exploration in thematic narrative-inspired interviews 4.5 years after mastectomy. Results: Three types of storylines were identified. In the first storyline, the mastectomy was described as no big deal; losing a breast did not disturb the women's view of themselves as women, and breast reconstruction was not even worth consideration. In the second storyline, the women described the mastectomy as shattering their identity. Losing a breast implied losing oneself as a sexual being, a woman, and a person. The third storyline fell in between the other two; the sense of femininity was wounded, but not to the extent that they felt lost as women. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the experience of mastectomy due to breast cancer is very much individual and contextual. Losing a breast may be of minor or major importance. Implications for Practice: Healthcare practitioners should be attentive to how the women themselves experience the personal meaning of losing a breast and guard against vague preconceptions based on the breast-sexuality-femininity discourse and its connection to what the patient needs. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The tax law treats hobbies and businesses in a significantly different manner. The ability to discern when an activity is a business and when it is a hobby is critically important. Unfortunately, tax practitioners face an additional challenge when making judgment decisions: competing incentives and pressure from the client. Practitioners not only have obligations to their clients but are also obligated to uphold the tax system. Balancing professional responsibilities with other incentives and pressures introduces an ethical dimension to the issue. In this case, you will have the opportunity to explore the hobby versus business question in the presence of client pressure and competing incentives. You will be required to research the technical tax issues and make appropriate recommendations. Rather than this being a mere tax law analysis, however, you also need to look deeper into the decision making process and examine the ethical issues involved. At the conclusion of the case, you will have demonstrated an understanding of both the technical tax issues and the ethical issues involved. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Aim: Normal individuals are risk averse for decisions framed as gains but risk taking for decisions framed as losses. This framing effect is supposed to be attenuated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. We investigated the effects of highlighting rewards versus highlighting punishments on the risky decision-making of AD patients. Method: Fourteen mild to moderate AD patients (Mini-Mental Status Examination score, 11-23; Clinical Dementia Rating, 1-2) and 16 healthy volunteers were recruited for the study. Subjects completed a computerized task on risky decision-making in which mathematically equivalent dilemmas were presented in terms of opportunities to gain monetary rewards ('positive frame') or avoid suffering losses ('negative frame'). Results: As expected, AD patients chose more risky options under the positive frame than the negative frame, contrary to the control group (Z =-2.671, P= 0.007). The normal difference in the distribution of risky choices between positively and negatively framed dilemmas was significantly reduced in the AD group after we adjusted for years of education, mean age and depression (F= 5.321, P= 0.030). Deliberation time did not differ significantly between the two groups. Conclusion: These results suggest that AD patients making high-risk choices is associated with attenuated sensitivity to the emotional frames that highlight rewards or punishments, possibly reflecting altered evaluations of prospective gains and losses. © 2012 The Authors.

      "Abstract: The inferior frontal gyrus/anterior insula (IFG/ AI) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) are key regions involved in risk appraisal during decision making, but accounts of how these regions contribute to decision making under risk remain contested. To help clarify the roles of these and other related regions, we used a modified version of the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (Lejuez et al., Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8, 75-84, 2002) to distinguish between decisionmaking and feedback-related processes when participants decided to pursue a gain as the probability of loss increased parametrically. Specifically, we set out to test whether the ACC and IFG/AI regions correspond to loss aversion at the time of decision making in a way that is not confounded with either reward-seeking or infrequency effects. When participants chose to discontinue inflating the balloon (win option), we observed greater ACC and mainly bilateral IFG/AI activity at the time of decision as the probability of explosion increased, consistent with increased loss aversion but inconsistent with an infrequency effect. In contrast, we found robust vmPFC activity when participants chose to continue inflating the balloon (risky option), consistent with reward seeking. However, in the cingulate and in mainly bilateral IFG regions, blood-oxygenation-level-dependent activation decreased when participants chose to inflate the balloon as the probability of explosion increased, findings that are consistent with a reduced loss aversion signal. Our results highlight the existence of distinct reward-seeking and loss-averse signals during decision making, as well as the importance of distinguishing between decision and feedback signals. © Psychonomic Society, Inc. 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

We test the predictions of the model using data from Egypt. We find that, even after controlling for the endogeneity of the temporary migration decision, an overseas returnee is more likely to become an entrepreneur than a non-migrant.

We use a binary probit specification to model the main drivers of a firm's propensity to be rated. Using a sample of 245 non-financial UK companies over the period 1995-2006, representing up to 2872 firm years, the study establishes important differences in the financial profiles of rated and non-rated firms. The results of the rating likelihood models indicate that the decision to obtain a rating is driven by a company's financial risk, solvency, default risk, public debt issuance, R&D, and institutional ownership, thus identifying a wider range of determinants and extending the current literature. The study also finds that the rating decision can be modelled by means of a contemporaneous or predictive specification without any loss of efficiency or classification accuracy.

The article also stresses that in the midst of continuing conflict the community learned to cope. Some coped in positive ways, others did not. To cope with the socio-economic impact of the armed conflict, some got involved in criminal activity. To survive in the midst of armed conflict, safe places were identified, some converting to Islam, checkpoints were established and armed vigilante groups were formed, and the people imposed restrictions upon themselves. Lastly, in order to overcome grief and loss, the people continued to observe religious rituals and rites and they did all they could to keep the family and community together. In 2005, UNICEF EAPRO initiated a regional study on \"Children Caught in Conflicts: Assessing the impact of armed conflict on children in East Asia and the Pacific.\" The objective of the study was three-fold: to improve the knowledge base on children affected by armed conflict, to devise protection strategies for children in situations of low-intensity conflict, and to involve participation of children and young people. Three countries participated: Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand. This article focuses on the results of the study conducted in the Philippines. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prior experimental studies supporting the prospect theory explanation of the sunk-cost effect manipulate the framing of the initial investment, describing it either in neutral terms or as a prior loss. This paper subjects the prospect theory explanation to further examination, but takes an alternative experimental approach based on the differential risk taking behaviour predicted by prospect theory's S-shaped value function. The experiments manipulate whether an initial investment produces a sunk cost (prior loss) or a sunk benefit (prior gain) and investigate the impact of this on the likelihood of authorising an incremental investment held constant across treatment conditions. To ensure the results are robust to the type of incremental investment, two experiments are conducted across which the outcomes of the incremental investment are manipulated to produce poor or good investment opportunities. In all cases the results fail to support a higher likelihood of authorising the incremental investment following a sunk cost than a sunk benefit. In isolation, therefore, prospect theory is unable to explain fully the sunk-cost effect. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Firms in a variety of industries offer add-on products to consumers who have previously purchased a base product. We posit that consumers, in making their decisions as to whether to purchase add-ons that complement the base products, find a greater need for the value offered by the add-ons when the \"unrecovered\" value (i.e., price paid minus the benefits obtained so far) associated with the base products is higher. We conduct experiments that test the proposed hypothesis and examine the strategic implications of such consumer decision making to a firm that sells base product add-on pairs. Consistent with our hypothesis, the experiments show that a consumer's unrecovered value associated with the base product is positively correlated to his likelihood of purchasing the add-on. Formal modeling of this bias shows that firms may find penetration pricing strategies (such as loss leader pricing) suboptimal. Furthermore, the identified bias leads the firm to spend more resources toward enhancing both the base product and the add-on quality, especially so when the add-on will be offered before the consumer has a chance to extensively use the base product. Finally, the effect of competition in the base product market is also considered. © 2012 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: After 11 years of follow-up, the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) reported a 29% reduction in prostate-cancer mortality among men who underwent screening for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. However, the extent to which harms to quality of life resulting from overdiagnosis and treatment counterbalance this benefit is uncertain. Methods: On the basis of ERSPC follow-up data, we used Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN) to predict the number of prostate cancers, treatments, deaths, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained after the introduction of PSA screening. Various screening strategies, efficacies, and quality-of-life assumptions were modeled. Results: Per 1000 men of all ages who were followed for their entire life span, we predicted that annual screening of men between the ages of 55 and 69 years would result in nine fewer deaths from prostate cancer (28% reduction), 14 fewer men receiving palliative therapy (35% reduction), and a total of 73 life-years gained (average, 8.4 years per prostate-cancer death avoided). The number of QALYs that were gained was 56 (range, -21 to 97), a reduction of 23% from unadjusted life-years gained. To prevent one prostate-cancer death, 98 men would need to be screened and 5 cancers would need to be detected. Screening of all men between the ages of 55 and 74 would result in more life-years gained (82) but the same number of QALYs (56). Conclusions: The benefit of PSA screening was diminished by loss of QALYs owing to postdiagnosis long-term effects. Longer follow-up data from both the ERSPC and quality-of-life analyses are essential before universal recommendations regarding screening can be made.

      "Abstract: This study describes how risk-based risk control allocation models work. We begin by discussing the economic rationale for allocating risk control in a diversified organization such as an enterprise. For a probability model for risk control decision making under uncertainty and risk, we propose a model involving stochastic total loss amount constraints with respect to various tolerable default levels. Our main objective is to develop a method that will allow shaping of the risk associated with risk control outcomes. The direct and indirect losses caused by simulated disasters can be estimated using an engineering and financial analysis model. Based on this model, we can generate an exceeding probability curve and then calculate how much of the loss can be eliminated or transferred to other entities should funds be allocated to risk control. The optimal natural disaster risk control arrangement with a probabilistic formulation is explained in this paper. Results from the proposed formulations are compared in case studies. The model attempts to apply risk-based budget guidelines to risk reduction measurement within a portfolio-based risk framework. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Protection values for three different Great Barrier Reef (GBR) sites were elicited to test t if the values could be easily transferred to other sites in the region. The sites were chosen to reflect substantial heterogeneity in extent, ecological composition and condition. Values were assessed both for local populations and for a distant population; residents of the state capital city of Brisbane. The results are encouraging for the use of benefit transfer, as values were robust to various site and population differences. No significant difference in protection values between the three local case studies could be identified. There was also no significant difference in values between the local population and the Brisbane population. However, some evidence for distance effects was identified for the Brisbane population, with closer sites valued more highly. There was some limited evidence that respondents have higher values to avoid potential losses compared to potential gains for REEF and SEAGRASS attributes, although this did not hold for the FISH attribute. One implication is that protection values are likely to be higher for closer reef areas at risk of loss than those with opportunity for improvement. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Contingent valuation typically involves presenting the respondent with a choice to pay for a program intended to improve future outcomes, such as a program to place parcels into conservation easement, or a program to manage an invasive species. Deducing from these data the value of the good (or bad) at the core of the program - the welfare gain generated by a parcel of conserved land, for instance, or the loss incurred by a species invasion - often is not possible because respondent preferences are conflated with their expectations about future environmental outcomes in the absence of the program. This paper formally demonstrates this conundrum in the context of a standard contingent valuation survey, and examines the use of additional survey data to resolve it. The application is to the prevention of lake invasions by Eurasian Watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), an invasive aquatic plant that is present in many lakes in the northern U.S. and Canada and a possible threat to many more. Respondents are shoreline property owners on lakes without Eurasian Watermilfoil. The estimated per-property welfare loss of a lake invasion is 30,550 for one model and 23,614 for another, both of which are in reasonable agreement with estimates obtained from a recent hedonic analysis of Eurasian Watermilfoil invasions in the study area [16], and from a companion contingent valuation survey of shoreline property owners on already-invaded lakes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background:Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can reduce prostate cancer mortality, but may advance diagnosis and treatment in time and lead to overdetection and overtreatment. We estimated benefits and adverse effects of PSA screening for individuals who are deciding whether or not to be screened.Methods:Using a microsimulation model, we estimated lifetime probabilities of prostate cancer diagnosis and death, overall life expectancy and expected time to diagnosis, both with and without screening. We calculated anticipated loss in quality of life due to prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment that would be acceptable to decide in favour of screening.Results:Men who were screened had a gain in life expectancy of 0.08 years but their expected time to diagnosis decreased by 1.53 life-years. Of the screened men, 0.99% gained on average 8.08 life-years and for 17.43% expected time to diagnosis decreased by 8.78 life-years. These figures imply that the anticipated loss in quality of life owing to diagnosis and treatment should not exceed 4.8%, for screening to have a positive effect on quality-adjusted life expectancy.Conclusion:The decision to be screened should depend on personal preferences. The negative impact of screening might be reduced by screening men who are more willing to accept the side effects from treatment. © 2012 Cancer Research UK.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Public participation requires the involvement of lay people in the decision-making processes of issues that concern them. It is currently practiced in a variety of domains, such as transport and environmental planning. Communicating risks can be a complex task, as there may be significant differences between the risk perceptions of experts and those of lay people. Among the plethora of problems that require public involvement is the site selection of a nuclear waste disposal site in the United Kingdom, which is discussed in this article. Previous ineffective attempts to locate a site provide evidence that the problem has a strong social dimension, and studies ascribe public opposition to a loss of public trust in governmental agencies and decisionmakers, and to a lack of public understanding of nuclear waste issues. Although the mental models approach has been successfully used in the effective communication of such risks as climate change, no attempt has been made to follow a prescriptive mental model approach to develop risk communication messages that inform lay people about nuclear waste disposal. After interviewing 20 lay people and 5 experts, we construct and compare their corresponding mental models to reveal any gaps and misconceptions. The mental models approach is further applied here to identify lay people's requirements regarding what they want to know about nuclear waste, and how this information should be presented so that it is easily understood. This article further describes how the mental models approach was used in the subsequent development of an online information system for the site selection of a nuclear waste repository in the United Kingdom, which is considered essential for the improvement of public understanding and the reestablishment of trust. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper evaluates how the global financial crisis emanating from the U.S. was transmitted to emerging markets. Our focus is on the extent that the crisis caused external market pressures (EMP), and whether the absorption of the shock was mainly through exchange rate depreciation or the loss of international reserves. Controlling for variety of factors associated with EMP, we find clear evidence that emerging markets with higher total foreign liabilities, including short- and long-term debt, equities, FDI and derivative products-had greater exposure and were much more vulnerable to the financial crisis. Countries with large balance sheet exposure - high external portfolio liabilities exceeding international reserves-absorbed the global shock by allowing greater exchange rate depreciation and comparatively less reserve loss. Despite the remarkable buildup of international reserves by emerging markets during the period prior to the financial crisis, countries relied primarily on exchange rate deprecation rather than reserve loss to absorb most of the exchange market pressure shock. This could reflect a deliberate choice (\" fear of reserve loss\" ) or market actions that caused very rapid exchange rate adjustment, especially in emerging markets with open capital markets, overwhelming policy actions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

In reality, investors can not be fully rational. Modeling investment decision-making behavior under imperfect rationality is becoming a theoretical research focus of mainstream economics. This paper firstly analyzes the characteristics of investors' imperfect rationality and studies the investors' risk attitudes from three elements (loss aversion, emotions mentality, mental accounting).

Depending on the reference level, some results indicate that it is possible for a capital income tax increase not to stimulate risk taking even if the tax code provides attractive full loss offset provisions. However, risk taking can be stimulated when investors compare their reference level with others. Risk taking can increase also if the investor interprets part of the tax as a loss instead as a reduced gain. Then the investor becomes risk seeking and moves away from the discomfort zone of relative losses. This later response to taxation causes private risk taking to increase. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Although many studies focus on the how contrast effects can impact cognitive evaluations, the question of whether emotions are regulated by such contrast effects is still the subject of considerable debate, especially in the study of loss-related decisions. To address this gap in the literature, we designed three decision making loss conditions: (i) both losses are trivial (TT), (ii) one loss is trivial and the other loss is vital (TV), or (iii) one loss is trivial and the other loss is routine (TR). In study 1, which compared the difference between the negative emotion ratings in TT and TV, we found that negative emotions were affected by the contrast effects. In study 2, which compared the difference between the importance of trivial options in TT and TV, we found that the contrast effects differentially changed the importance of trivial options in the two conditions, which in turn down-regulated negative emotions. In study 3, the impact of decision difficulty was controlled by predetermining the items to be lost. In this study, we found that, when comparing the differences between the negative emotions of losing trivial options in TV and TR, the contrast effects still modulated the loss-related emotions. We concluded that the contrast effects could down-regulate emotions. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that contrast effects can alleviate negative affect in loss-related decision making. This study will enrich and extend the literature on emotion regulation theory, and it will provide a new cost-effective mitigation strategy for regulating negative emotions. © 2012 Li et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Disaster survivors have not only experienced a tragedy, but they may also have been simultaneously displaced to places usually unfamiliar to them. What does being displaced mean in terms of survivors' experiences? This qualitative study explored, through in-depth interviews, the experiences of nine displaced Hurricane Katrina (HK) survivors. Using critical theory as a framework, our intent was to describe the experiences before, during, and after HK of displaced survivors who sought disaster relief aid from a social services agency in a city in southeastern United States. A consensual qualitative research (CQR) analysis (Hill et al., 2005) yielded four domains: (a) Life before HK, (b) preparing for the storm, (c) losses after HK, and (d) consequences of being displaced. For these nine participants, life before HK was fraught with family conditions of poverty, substance abuse, and criminal arrest. In preparing for the storm, participants made the decision to stay or evacuate, depending on their contexts and available resources. Losses after HK included lives, shelter, employment, belongings, safety, and community. Consequences of being displaced included financial hardship, the fight for resources, loss of trust and faith in government, inadequate health care, strained relationships with family or friends, and separation from community. Displacement after the storm resulted in more vulnerability and the loss of a cultural community, which had been the participants' main source of support. These results underscore how practitioners and policymakers need to consider how culturally different the survivors' home was from where they were relocated. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this study, the authors consider the restless multi-armed bandit problem, which is one of the most well-studied generalisations of the celebrated stochastic multi-armed bandit problem in decision theory. However, it is known to be PSPACE-Hard to approximate to any non-trivial factor. Thus, the optimality is very difficult to obtain because of its high complexity. A natural method is to obtain the greedy policy considering its stability and simplicity. However, the greedy policy will result in the optimality loss for its intrinsic myopic behaviour generally. In this study, by analysing one class of so-called standard reward function, the authors establish the closed-form condition about the discounted factor β such that the optimality of the greedy policy is guaranteed under the discounted expected reward criterion, especially, the condition β=1 indicating the optimality of the greedy policy under the average accumulative reward criterion. Thus, this kind of standard reward function can easily be used to judge the optimality of the greedy policy without any complicated calculation. Some examples in cognitive radio networks are presented to verify the effectiveness of the mathematical result in judging the optimality of the greedy policy. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Like many authors of his time, Smith assumes a greater sensitivity to adverse than to prosperous events. Though neglected by commentators, with the exception of Ashraf et al. (2005), the influence that he attaches to prosperity and adversity on happiness deserves special attention, particularly from an analytical point of view. This paper aims at bringing out the implications of such an asymmetry for his work and for current developments concerning decision and welfare. Since the argument that comes to justify this asymmetry, in the Theory of Moral sentiments, is not clear, both in its structure and in its content, the first step consists in a clarification of Smith's position resting, principally, on the History of Astronomy, which introduces the concepts of 'custom' and 'surprise'. Next, Smith's argument is discussed in a more formal framework, through alternative approaches of what might be considered a Smithian happiness function: reference-dependent models with loss aversion or standard cardinal utility-like functions. Textual evidences leads to favour the last alternative. This also leads to non-trivial conclusions concerning the way Smith views individual happiness. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper explores the role of value judgements in personal risk management through an in-depth case study involving a woman's treatment for anal cancer. Julia (pseudonym) agreed to have her pre-treatment medical consultation recorded, and participated in two subsequent interviews. Delving into a single case makes it possible to understand why an individual makes decisions in relation to the overall nexus of risks and benefits which they identify even though their choices may seem irrational to others. According to the colorectal nurse research interviewer, Julia 'risked exploding' as a result of 'absconding' (Julia's term) from hospital in order to have sex shortly after undergoing surgery. Although not to be interpreted literally, the above phrase encapsulates Julia's risk blindness from a clinical perspective. The article will address the question of how one person came to put herself at unnecessary risk. The question will be considered in relation to non-communication about the interconnected web of issues which troubled Julia, including cosmology, mortality, being left with an unclean, leaky body, loss of economic viability and harm to family members and to close relationships. This analytical framework complements the more usual one in which attitudes towards a particular risk object are compared across cases. The article makes a contribution, within the limits of a single case study, to advancing knowledge about the neglected topic of individual risk consciousness. It will be argued that, in the absence of such analysis, personal decision-making about risks cannot be fully understood, appropriate advice given or sensitive policies developed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Reducing loss of life and harm when a hurricane threatens depends on people receiving hurricane risk information that they can interpret and use in protective decisions. To understand and improve hurricane risk communication, this article examines how National Weather Service (NWS) forecasters at the National Hurricane Center and local weather forecast offices, local emergency managers, and local television and radio media create and convey hurricane risk information. Data from in-depth interviews and observational sessions with members of these groups from Greater Miami were analyzed to examine their roles, goals, and interactions, and to identify strengths and challenges in how they communicate with each other and with the public. Together, these groups succeed in partnering with each other to make information about approaching hurricane threats widely available. Yet NWS forecasters sometimes find that the information they provide is not used as they intended; media personnel want streamlined information from NWS and emergency managers that emphasizes the timing of hazards and the recommended response and protective actions; and emergency managers need forecast uncertainty information that can help them plan for different scenarios. Thus, we recommend that warning system partners 1) build understanding of each other's needs and constraints; 2) ensure formalized, yet flexible mechanisms exist for exchanging critical information; 3) improve hurricane risk communication by integrating social science knowledge to design and test messages with intended audiences; and 4) evaluate, test, and improve the NWS hurricane-related product suite in collaboration with social scientists. ©2012 American Meteorological Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Critics of the legal system argue that the use of lay jurors to adjudicate auditor negligence claims results in non-meritorious decisions of auditor liability. Palmrose (2006) therefore proposes that the courts rely on panels of experienced auditors to evaluate the merits of auditor negligence claims and make recommendations to the courts. There is, however, scant evidence to indicate how auditors' and lay evaluators' judgments might differ in cases of alleged auditor negligence. Our study addresses this gap in the literature by providing theory and empirical evidence that elucidates several systematic differences between auditors' and lay evaluators' judgments. Results of an experiment indicate that auditor evaluators are less reliant on plaintiff losses as evidence than lay evaluators, but-consistent with social identity theory-experience greater empathy for auditor defendants. Consequently, auditor evaluators consistently provide lower assessments of auditor liability than lay evaluators, irrespective of audit quality. In addition, results of the experiment indicate that different legally irrelevant inputs primarily determine both auditor and lay evaluators' negligence verdicts-emotional reactions for auditor evaluators and plaintiff losses for lay evaluators. Finally, results are mixed as to whether auditor evaluators' judgments are more sensitive to varying levels of audit quality than lay evaluators' judgments.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Current projections of long-term trends in Atlantic hurricane activity due to climate change are deeply uncertain, both in magnitude and sign. This creates challenges for adaptation planning in exposed coastal communities. We present a framework to support the interpretation of current long-term tropical cyclone projections, which accommodates the nature of the uncertainty and aims to facilitate robust decision making using the information that is available today. The framework is populated with projections taken from the recent literature to develop a set of scenarios of long-term hurricane hazard. Hazard scenarios are then used to generate risk scenarios for Florida using a coupled climate-catastrophe modeling approach. The scenarios represent a broad range of plausible futures; from wind-related hurricane losses in Florida halving by the end of the century to more than a four-fold increase due to climate change alone. We suggest that it is not possible, based on current evidence, to meaningfully quantify the relative confidence of each scenario. The analyses also suggest that natural variability is likely to be the dominant driver of the level and volatility of wind-related risk over the coming decade; however, under the highest scenario, the superposition of this natural variability and anthropogenic climate change could mean notably increased levels of risk within the decade. Finally, we present a series of analyses to better understand the relative adequacy of the different models that underpin the scenarios and draw conclusions for the design of future climate science and modeling experiments to be most informative for adaptation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Potential optimality analysis is a traditional method to evaluate alternatives with imprecise information. The essence of this approach is to identify any alternative that outperforms the others in its best-case scenario. Our analysis shows that potential optimality analysis is optimistic in nature and may lead to a significant loss if an unfavorable scenario occurs. We suggest a robust optimization analysis approach that ranks alternatives in terms of their worst-case absolute or relative regret. A robust optimal alternative performs reasonably well in all scenarios and is shown to be desirable for a risk-concerned decision maker. Linear programming models are developed to check robust optimality. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This article analysed farmers' perceptions of the effects of coconut mite in their livelihood and assessed crop diversification as a copping strategy for reduced coconut production. A socio-economic model of farmers' decisions on intercropping as an indicator for overall crop diversity was developed. The study was conducted between November 2009 and March 2010 in five districts in Tanzania, which were selected on the basis of the coconut's economic importance, using structured questionnaires which were administered to 200 household heads. Respondents were categorized in three groups-resource-poor farmers (43% of sample), medium-level farmers (50%) and well-off farmers (7%) according to six criteria. More than 80% of farmers were aware of the negative effects of the coconut mite. The result further indicated that the damaged nuts cause a loss of more than 30% of the cash income from coconut. Intercropping coconut with cassava, maize, cashew nut, sorghum and pineapples were the alternatives used by farmers to cope with declining coconut production caused by coconut mite and lethal yellowing disease. Land ownership and size, income from crops, non-farm income and family size were the main factors that influenced the farmer's decision to diversify crops. Although farmers diversify their cropping systems in order to be self-reliant, there is still a need to promote policies and programmes that will address coconut production constraints such pests and diseases such as rehabilitation of old plantations. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper explores the question of whether there are inherent limits to our ability to learn from experience about the value of protection against low-probability, high-consequence, events. Findings are reported from two controlled experiments in which participants have a monetary incentive to learn from experience making investments to protect against hurricane risks. A central finding is that investments display a short-term forgetting effect consistent with the use of reinforcement learning rules, where a significant driver of investments in a given period is whether storm losses were incurred in the precious period. Given the relative rarity of such losses, this reinforcement process produces a mean investment level below that which would be optimal for most storm threats. Investments are also found to be insensitive to the censoring effect of protection itself, implying that the size of experienced losses-rather than losses that are avoided-is the primary driver of investment decisions. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Goyal and Wahal showed that plan sponsors typically lose value when firing an underperforming manager and hiring its replacement. Experience suggests that most investors appreciate this research but then ignore it when making decisions. To redress this problem, we build a model that shows an investor its expected loss from hiring and firing its managers for performance reasons. By knowing this likely loss, we hope that investors will make fewer performance-related decisions and therefore improve their returns. Another useful part of the model is that it can also project an investor's likely gain from taking profits from a manager with exceptional outperformance. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous research found that children first experience regret at 5 years and relief at 7. In two experiments, we explored three possibilities for this lag: (1) relief genuinely develops later than regret; (2) tests of relief have previously been artefactually difficult; or (3) evidence for regret resulted from false positives. In Experiment 1 (N=162 4- to 7-year-olds) children chose one of two cards that led to winning or losing tokens. Children rated their happiness then saw a better (regret) or worse (relief) alternative. Children re-rated their happiness. Regret after winning was first experienced at 4, regret after losing and relief after winning were experienced at 5 years and relief after losing at 7 years. Experiment 2 (N=297 5- to 8-year-olds) used a similar task but manipulated children's responsibility for the outcome. Greater responsibility for the outcome resulted in a greater likelihood of an experience of regret and relief. Results support that previous tests of relief were artefactually difficult and regret and relief are experienced earlier than previously thought. © 2012 Copyright Psychology Press Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: To facilitate managers' decision-making, firms develop strategic performance measurement systems that translate strategy into performance measures. Ideally, managers see measures for what they are-imperfect proxies for intangible strategic constructs. However, managers may fail to fully appreciate the fact that measures are merely representations of the strategic constructs, and act as though the measures are the construct of interest-a phenomenon we label surrogation. In this paper, we investigate whether and how the use of strategically linked performance measures for compensation purposes affects managers' propensity to exhibit surrogation. In accordance with the attribute substitution framework (Kahneman and Frederick 2002), we predict incentive compensation exacerbates surrogation, and that this effect is more prevalent when managers are compensated on a single measure of a strategic construct than when managers are compensated on multiple measures of a strategic construct. Via two experiments, we find support for these hypotheses. Our paper contributes to the literature on strategic performance measurement systems by highlighting the tendency of managers to use measures as surrogates for strategy. More generally, we identify a by-product of contracting on imperfect performance measures not previously considered in extant literature, and establish when consideration of costs of this by-product are likely to be critical.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Time discounting refers to the fact that the subjective value of a reward decreases as the delay until its occurrence increases. The present study investigated how time discounting has been affected in survivors of the magnitude-8.0 Wenchuan earthquake that occurred in China in 2008. Methodology: Nineteen earthquake survivors and 22 controls, all school teachers, participated in the study. Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) for time discounting tasks involving gains and losses were acquired in both the victims and controls. Findings: The behavioral data replicated our previous findings that delayed gains were discounted more steeply after a disaster. ERP results revealed that the P200 and P300 amplitudes were increased in earthquake survivors. There was a significant group (earthquake vs. non- earthquake) × task (gain vs. loss) interaction for the N300 amplitude, with a marginally significantly reduced N300 for gain tasks in the experimental group, which may suggest a deficiency in inhibitory control for gains among victims. Conclusions: The results suggest that post-disaster decisions might involve more emotional (System 1) and less rational thinking (System 2) in terms of a dual-process model of decision making. The implications for post-disaster intervention and management are also discussed. © 2012 Li et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Frequent tropical cyclones pose great risks and obstacles to the development of offshore wind farms in the coastal regions of China and other areas in the Pacific, where development of wind energy is gaining momentum. This paper aims to identify and evaluate the economic risks of tropical cyclones on offshore wind farms within the Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ) of China and help improve decision-making for planners and investors. The risks of tropical cyclone impact in this paper are defined by the statistical extreme wind climate and the annual expected economic losses of offshore wind farms. A probabilistic tropical cyclone event model is applied to evaluate 20-year, 30-year, 50-year and 100-year recurrence of extreme wind speeds by geographical location. Combining a damage model derived from empirical loss data and an investment cost model within a Geographical Information System (GIS), the annual expected economic losses of offshore wind farms from tropical cyclones are evaluated and shown on a spatially continuous risk map. Results are given in terms of annual economic risks and damage losses based on occurrence of an average recurrence interval. Implications on identifying offshore wind potential and cost and setting design parameters for offshore wind turbines are then discussed. The impact of tropical cyclones on offshore wind farms likes a double-edged sword, which might be advantageous for some regions in terms of increasing full-loaded hours of turbines, but also disadvantageous for others due to its destructive effects. However, specific design standards and insurance of turbines would help reduce risks and economic losses of offshore wind farms in tropical cyclone prone areas and expand exploitable locations for future offshore wind farms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: The uncertainty around number needed to treat (NNT) is often represented through a confidence interval (CI). However, it is not clear how the CI can help inform treatment decisions. We developed decision-theoretic measures of uncertainty for the NNT. Study Design and Setting: We build our argument on the basis that a risk-neutral decision maker should always choose the treatment with the highest expected benefit, regardless of uncertainty. From this perspective, uncertainty can be seen as a source of \"opportunity loss\" owing to its associated chance of choosing the suboptimal treatment. Motivated from the concept of the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) in decision analysis, we quantify such opportunity loss and propose novel measures of uncertainty around the NNT: the Lost NNT and the Lost Opportunity Index (LOI). Results: The Lost NNT is the quantification of the lost opportunity expressed on the same scale as the NNT. The LOI is a scale-free measure quantifying the loss in terms of the relative efficacy of treatment. We illustrate the method using a sample of published NNT values. Conclusion: Decision-theoretic concepts have the potential to be applied in this context to provide measures of uncertainty that can have relevant implications. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

      "Abstract: Background: The prevalence of obesity is over 25 % in many developed countries. Obesity is strongly associated with an increased risk of fatal and chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Therefore it has become a major public health concern for many economies. E-learning devices are a relatively novel approach to promoting dietary change. The new generation of devices are adaptive and use interactive electronic media to facilitate teaching and learning. E-Learning has grown out of recent developments in information and communication technology, such as the Internet, interactive computer programmes, interactive television and mobile phones. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of e-learning devices as a method of promoting weight loss via dietary change. Methods: An economic evaluation was performed using decision modelling techniques. Outcomes were expressed in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and costs were estimated from a health services perspective. All parameter estimates were derived from the literature. A systematic review was undertaken to derive the estimate of relative treatment effect. Results: The base case results from the e-Learning Economic Evaluation Model (e-LEEM) suggested that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately 102,000 per Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) compared to conventional care. This finding was robust to most alternative assumptions, except a much lower fixed cost of providing e-learning devices. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analysis showed that while the individual level EVPI was arguably negligible, the population level value was between 37 M and 170 M at a willingness to pay between 20,000 to 30,000 per additional QALY. Conclusion: The current economic evidence base suggests that e-learning devices for managing the weight of obese individuals are unlikely to be cost-effective unless their fixed costs are much lower than estimated or future devices prove to be much more effective. © 2012 Miners et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: How should a firm modify its product assortment over time when learning about consumer tastes? In this paper, we study dynamic assortment decisions in a horizontally differentiated product category for which consumers' diverse tastes can be represented as locations on a Hotelling line. We presume that the firm knows all possible consumer locations, comprising a finite set, but does not know their probability distribution. We model this problem as a discrete-time dynamic program; each period, the firm chooses an assortment and sets prices to maximize the total expected profit over a finite horizon, given its subjective beliefs over consumer tastes. The consumers then choose a product from the assortment that maximizes their own utility. The firm observes sales, which provide censored information on consumer tastes, and it updates beliefs in a Bayesian fashion. There is a recurring trade-off between the immediate profits from sales in the current period (exploitation) and the informational gains to be exploited in all future periods (exploration). We show that one can (partially) order assortments based on their information content and that in any given period the optimal assortment cannot be less informative than the myopically optimal assortment. This result is akin to the well-known \"stock more\" result in censored newsvendor problems with the newsvendor learning about demand through sales when lost sales are not observable. We demonstrate that it can be optimal for the firm to alternate between exploration and exploitation, and even offer assortments that lead to losses in the current period in order to gain information on consumer tastes. We also develop a Bayesian conjugate model that reduces the state space of the dynamic program and study value of learning using this conjugate model. © 2012 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

This theory reduces to the maximization of expected utility when the pair of posteriors is induced by an exact or approximate confidence set estimator or when a reduction rule is applied to the pair.

      "Abstract: Standard engineering procedures, such as adopting high return periods as reference events, are a simplified means of handling the complex and multivariate nature of snow avalanches. Furthermore, such methods do not explicitly take into account the elements at risk and/or possible budgetary constraints. In recent years, many authors from a variety of fields have tried to overcome these limitations with quantitative risk evaluations including cost-benefit analyses. Their proposals are based on different modelling assumptions, and often on different definitions for certain important concepts including scenarios, vulnerability relations and time effects. The first goal of this paper is to propose a state of the art, and to discuss the common points, advantages and drawbacks of the various proposals within a unified formal framework based on decision theory. Most of the applications already in use concern long term risk assessment in land use planning and traffic road regulation, but some potential also exists for short term problems including risk assessment to back-country skiing. In a second time, new extensions of a simple decisional model for the optimal design of an avalanche dam are proposed to illustrate the key point of the place of uncertainty in risk analyses. Finally, to stimulate further research efforts, other important outlooks including computational issues, multivariate optimal design and measures of risk alternative to the standard expected loss minimisation are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

I review the empirical evidence on these two sets of anomalies. Paying for inherently interesting tasks, paying for prosocial behavior, paying too much, paying too little, and providing too many options can all be counterproductive. At the same time, proper design of the decision-making environment can be a potent way to induce certain behaviors. After presenting the empirical evidence, I discuss the relative role of beliefs, preferences, and technology in the anomalous impacts of incentives. I argue that inference, signaling, loss aversion, dynamic inconsistency, and choking are the primary factors that explain the data. © 2012 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction: Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) provide important information about the sensitivity of the brain to process varying risks. The aim of the present study was to determine how different risk levels are reflected in decision-related ERPs, namely the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300. Materials and Methods: Twenty participants conducted a probabilistic two-choice gambling task while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Choices were provided between a low-risk option yielding low rewards and low losses and a high-risk option yielding high rewards and high losses. While options differed in expected risks, they were equal in expected values and in feedback probabilities. Results: At the behavioral level, participants were generally risk-averse but modulated their risk-taking behavior according to reward history. An early positivity (P200) was enhanced on negative feedbacks in high-risk compared to low-risk choices. With regard to the FRN, there were significant amplitude differences between positive and negative feedbacks on high-risk choices, but not on low-risk choices. While the FRN on negative feedbacks did not vary with decision riskiness, reduced amplitudes were found for positive feedbacks in high-risk relative to low-risk choices. P300 amplitudes were larger in high-risk decisions, and in an additive way, after negative compared to positive feedback. Discussion: The present study revealed significant influences of risk and valence processing on ERPs. FRN findings suggest that the reward prediction error signal is increased after high-risk decisions. The increased P200 on negative feedback in risky decisions suggests that large negative prediction errors are already processed in the P200 time range. The later P300 amplitude is sensitive to feedback valence as well as to the risk associated with a decision. Thus, the P300 carries additional information for reward processing, mainly the enhanced motivational significance of risky decisions. © 2012 Schuermann, Endrass and Kathmann.\u001b[0m :\n",

Therefore, the present study deals with the effect of corporate governance mechanisms on changing the auditors of companies listed in Tehran Stock Exchange over the course of 2006 - 2010. To these objectives, Panel Data in the form of five hypotheses were employed and considered. Results of this study revealed that there is a significant relationship between the numbers of non-Executive members of the board, separation of CEO from board chairman, receiving the nonstandard audit report last year and the change of companies' auditor. But, no significant relationship was observed between the percentage of majority stock holders and the company's losses in previous years with change of companies' auditor. According to the findings, it is suggest that Iranian Capital markets activists consider the role of non-executive, number of board directors, CEO separation from the Chairman and the impact of change companies' auditor in their decision makings.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Humans often make seemingly irrational choices in situations of conflict between a particular smaller- sooner reinforcer and a more abstract, temporally extended, but larger reinforcer. In two experiments, the extent to which the availability of commitment responses-self-imposed restrictions on future choices-might improve self-control in such situations was investigated. Participants played a prisoner's dilemma game against a computer that played a tit-for-tat strategy-cooperating after a participant cooperated, defecting after a participant defected. Defecting produced a small-immediate reinforcer (consisting of points convertible to gift cards) whereas cooperating increased the amount of subsequent reinforcers, yielding a greater overall reinforcer rate. Participants were normally free to cooperate or defect on each trial. Additionally, they could choose to make a commitment response that forced their choice for the ensuing five trials. For some participants, the commitment response forced cooperation; for others, it forced defection. Most participants, with either commitment response available, chose to commit repeatedly despite a minor point loss for doing so. After extended exposure to these contingencies, the commit-to-cooperate group cooperated significantly more than a control group (with no commitment available). The commit-to-defect group cooperated significantly less than the control group. When both commitment alternatives were simultaneously available-one for cooperation and one for defection-cooperation commitment was strongly preferred. In Experiment 2, the commitment alternative was removed at the end of the session; gains in cooperation, relative to the control group, were not sustained in the absence of the self-imposed behavioral scaffold.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Quantitative analysis and assessment of risk to civil infrastructure has two components: probability of a potentially damaging event and consequence of damage, measured in terms of financial or human losses. Decision models that have been utilized during the past three decades take into account the probabilistic component rationally, but address decision-maker attitudes toward consequences and risk only to a limited degree. The application of models reflecting these attitudes to decisions involving low-probability, high-consequence events that may impact civil infrastructure requires a fundamental understanding of risk acceptance attitudes and how they affect individual and group choices. In particular, the phenomenon of risk aversion may be a significant factor in decisions for civil infrastructure exposed to low-probability events with severe consequences, such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods.

      "Abstract: Satisfaction with service-related choices has not received much research attention, especially beyond medical/health-related decisions. This paper reports findings from an analysis of parents' accounts of making service-related choices with, or on behalf of, a disabled son or daughter with a degenerative condition. It focuses particularly on factors and processes, which contribute to parents' satisfaction. This is particularly interesting given that sub-optimal outcomes or negative consequences are often experienced following a service-related choice being implemented. The data reported here were collected as part of a larger, longitudinal study (the Choice and Change project) of service users' experiences of choice-making, including the outcomes and consequences of those choices. Parents of disabled young people with degenerative conditions formed part of this sample. The accounts of 14 of these parents, collected over three interviews during a two and a half-year period, all of whom expressed satisfaction with the medium- to long-term outcomes of a service-related choice, were selected for specific analyses to understand what underlies satisfaction with service-related choices. Clarity of the desired outcome for the young person supported effective decision-making and led parents to feel confident that the best possible choice was being made. Evidence of desired outcomes being attained were used by parents to 'trade off' the negative consequences of a choice. These included the considerable demands placed on parents' personal, financial and practical resources to operationalise a choice, and the emotional impact incurred by significant changes such as the loss of the carer role. The passage of time was important in allowing evidence of positive outcomes to emerge, psychological or emotional adjustments to be made, and for parents to develop trust in new service providers. The findings suggest that practitioners can have an important role in both practical and emotional support for parents' choice-making for, or with, their disabled son/daughter. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Research has identified loss aversion as a strong and robust phenomenon, but has also revealed some moderators affecting the magnitude of its effect on decision making. In the current article, we draw attention to the fact that even the measurement of loss aversion itself may affect its magnitude by inducing a focus on either losses or gains. In three studies, we provide empirical evidence for such a measurement-induced focus. In all studies we used cointoss gambles-in which there is a 50/50 chance to win or to lose-to assess gain/loss ratios as a measure of loss aversion. Participants either filled out the loss side or the gain side of this gain/loss ratio. The studies consistently showed that-using within- and between-subject designs and anticipated and real coin-toss gambles-the strength of loss aversion depended on the measurement format (fill-in-the-loss versus fill-in-the-gain); filling in the loss side increased loss aversion. Moreover, loss aversion was more affected by the stakes of the gamble in the fill-in-the-loss format than in the fill-in-the-gain format.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The current research examines the effects of time pressure on decision behavior based on a prospect theory framework. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants estimated certainty equivalents for binary gains-only bets in the presence or absence of time pressure. In Experiment 3, participants assessed comparable bets that were framed as losses. Data were modeled to establish psychological mechanisms underlying decision behavior. In Experiments 1 and 2, time pressure led to increased risk attractiveness, but no significant differences emerged in either probability discriminability or outcome utility. In Experiment 3, time pressure reduced probability discriminability, which was coupled with severe risk-seeking behavior for both conditions in the domain of losses. No significant effects of control over outcomes were observed. Results provide qualified support for theories that suggest increased risk-seeking for gains under time pressure. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Sexual pleasure has been identified as an important consideration in decision-making surrounding condom use. We examined the impact of perceived pleasure loss associated with condom use on recent history of insertive and receptive unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the United States. A total of 482 Dominican, Colombian, and Brazilian immigrant MSM were surveyed regarding sexual attitudes and practices via computer-assisted self-interviewing technology with audio enhancement (ACASI). Participants rated the pleasure they derived from protected and unprotected anal intercourse in each position (insertive and receptive) and also reported their HIV status, relationship status, and recent sexual history. Men who had engaged in both positions, with and without condoms (n=268), perceived a greater pleasure loss associated with condoms during anal intercourse in the insertive versus receptive position. Logistic regression analyses controlling for HIV status, relationship status, and age revealed that men who perceived greater pleasure loss from condoms were more likely to have engaged in UAI over the past 3 months (n[insertive]=297; n[receptive]=284). Findings indicate that the pleasure loss associated with condoms may be a key deterrent for their use in either sex position among Latino MSM. Therefore, pleasure needs to be prioritized in the development of condoms and other sexual safety measures as well as in the promotion of their use. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A type of emergency decision-making which has not received research attention is the police search for a lost person in a rural or wilderness area. For many such incidents, decisions concerning where to search for the lost subject are made by a planning team, each member of which assigns probabilities to the various hypotheses about where the subject might be located, including the residual hypothesis that the subject is somewhere else entirely, that is, outside of the designated search area. In the current study, 32 adult males with search planning experience were asked to assign probabilities to a fictional lost person incident. It was hypothesized, according to support theory (Tversky & Koehler, 1994), that subjects who first considered the five possible scenarios accounting for how the subject could have left the search area-i.e., unpacked the residual hypothesis-would subsequently increase their probability estimate of the global hypothesis that the missing subject was not in the designated search area, compared to those subjects who unpacked the focal hypothesis. This hypothesis was confirmed. We also found considerable evidence for subadditivity, as most subjects estimated higher summed probabilities for the individual scenarios accounting for the focal and residual hypotheses, respectively. The potential negative consequences of such unpacking effects during a lost person incident were discussed, and possible means of mitigating such effects were described.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Runs of gains and losses are particularly salient to decision makers because of their perceived departure from randomness, as well as their immediate impact on the financial status of the decision makers. Past research has focused on decision making biases that relate to faulty conceptions of chance and luck, such as the gambler's fallacy and the hot hand effect. Participants in the current study bet on the outcomes of a long sequence of simulated coin tosses. Risk preferences were found to change as a function of run valence (i.e., losses vs. gains), run length, and financial status. Individuals were found to differ in the effect of all of these factors, in their responses to runs of gains and losses in sequential risky choice.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Living kidney donation is associated with better recipient outcomes compared with deceased kidney donation, but living kidney donors face the risk of physical and psychological complications. The aim of this study was to synthesize published qualitative studies of the experiences and perspectives of living kidney donors. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies of motivations to donate and experiences after donation of living kidney donors. MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles were searched to April 2011. Results: 26 studies involving 478 donors were included. We identified 6 themes about the decision to donate: compelled altruism, inherent responsibility, accepting risks, family expectation, personal benefit, and spiritual confirmation. Three themes dominated the impact of donation and postdonation: renegotiating identity (including subthemes of fear and vulnerability, sense of loss, depression and guilt, new appreciation of life, and personal growth and self-worth), renegotiating roles (including subthemes of multiplicity of roles, unable to resume previous activities, and hero status), and renegotiating relationships (including subthemes of neglect, proprietorial concern, strengthened family and recipient bonds, and avoidance of recipient indebtedness). Conclusions: Kidney donation has a profound and multifaceted impact on the lives of donors and requires them to renegotiate their identity, roles, and relationships. Strategies to safeguard against unwarranted coercion, and to maximize donor resilience, capacity to negotiate their multiple roles as a patient and carer, emotional fortitude, and ability to have balanced expectations and relationships with the recipient and the family are needed to ultimately protect the safety and well-being of living kidney donors. © 2012 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In the context of decision making for retirees of a defined contribution pension scheme in the de-cumulation phase, we formulate and solve a problem of finding the optimal time of annuitization for a retiree having the possibility of choosing her own investment and consumption strategy. We formulate the problem as a combined stochastic control and optimal stopping problem. As criterion for the optimization we select a loss function that penalizes both the deviance of the running consumption rate from a desired consumption rate and the deviance of the final wealth at the time of annuitization from a desired target. We find closed-form solutions for the problem and show the existence of three possible types of solutions depending on the free parameters of the problem. In numerical applications we find the optimal wealth that triggers annuitization, compare it with the desired target and investigate its dependence on both parameters of the financial market and parameters linked to the risk attitude of the retiree. Simulations of the behaviour of the risky asset seem to show that, under typical situations, optimal annuitization should occur a few years after retirement. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Losses loom larger than gains. The typical interpretation of loss aversion involves a subjective value-based asymmetry between gains and losses, with individuals expecting losses to be more painful than gains of equal size to be pleasurable. This paper reveals a novel, subjective probability-based asymmetry between gains and losses that may contribute to loss aversion in risky choice. Results from five experiments suggest that losses may loom not only larger, but also more likely than gains. The propensity of losses to attract attention and to be subsequently imagined appears to underlie the proposed asymmetry. The effect translates into changes in predicted behavior, with subjective probability mediating the impact of imagination on the predicted likelihood to accept to play an equal-probability gamble. The implications of our findings for loss aversion, the negativity bias, and the imagination literature are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous studies have led to hypothesizing that right DLPFC activity is related to risk propensity, but the generality of this relationship remains unclear. Here, we experimentally modulated DLPFC activity in 47 healthy, female volunteers during a risky decision-making task, where monetary gambles defined by potential win, loss, and outcome probability were evaluated in the absence of feedback and uncertainty. Three participant groups, receiving left anodal/right cathodal, right anodal/left cathodal, and sham tDCS, were compared. Overall, participants performed the task well above chance level and were significantly risk averse, but tDCS did not affect task performance or risk propensity. However, right anodal/left cathodal tDCS significantly elevated response confidence, independently of accept/reject response. Our results suggest that the relationship between DLPFC activity and risk propensity may not be universally valid for all task types and requires further characterization. Enhancing right and attenuating left DLPFC activity boosts subjective confidence, with potential implications for understanding pathological gambling. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.\u001b[0m :\n",

Here, the effects of potential rewards and losses on inhibitory control in 64 adolescents (13- to 17-year-olds) and 42 young adults (18- to 29-year-olds) were examined using an incentivized antisaccade task. Notably, measures were implemented to minimize age-related differences in reward valuation and potentially confounding motivation effects. Incentives affected antisaccade metrics differently across the age groups. Younger adolescents generated more errors than adults on reward trials, but all groups performed well on loss trials. Adolescent saccade latencies also differed from adults across the range of reward trials. Overall, results suggest persistent immaturities in the integration of reward and inhibitory control processes across adolescence. © 2012 The Authors.

      "Abstract: Helfstein, Scott. (2011) Backfire: Behavioral Decision Making and the Strategic Risks of Successful Surprise. Foreign Policy Analysis, doi: 10.1111/j.1743-8594.2011.00165.x States attempting surprise attacks usually achieve tactical success in catching an opponent unprepared. Many studies of surprise do not look beyond the opening bolt from the blue to examine the impact of surprise based on the broader strategic objectives. A comparative case study of centrally planned surprise attacks from 1950 to 1990 suggests that surprise rarely achieves strategic ends. They did not deter the targets from military action, and more surprisingly, did not contribute to less deadly wars. This runs counter to conventional beliefs about surprise, since attacks are supposed to impair a target's desire or ability to mount a military response. Instead, the most damaging surprises are followed by particularly bloody conflict, a phenomenon referred to here as backfire. The article examines a number of possible strategic explanations for this empirical pattern and ultimately concludes that behavioral decision-making processes characterized by prospect theory offer the best possible explanation. An increased propensity for risk, resulting from the losses suffered during a large surprise, drives target military reaction despite the lower likelihood of success. © 2011 International Studies Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Electroencephalogram studies have identified an error-related event-related potential (ERP) component known as the error-related negativity or ERN, thought to result from the detection of a loss of reward during performance monitoring. However, as own errors are always associated with a loss of reward, disentangling whether the ERN is error- or reward-dependent has proven to be a difficult endeavor. Recently, an ERN has also been demonstrated following the observation of other's errors. Importantly, other people's errors can be associated with loss or gain depending on the cooperative or competitive context in which they are made. The aim of the current ERP study was to disentangle the error- or reward-dependency of performance monitoring. Twelve pairs (N= 24) of participants performed and observed a speeded-choice-reaction task in two contexts. Own errors were always associated with a loss of reward. Observed errors in the cooperative context also yielded a loss of reward, but observed errors in the competitive context resulted in a gain. The results showed that the ERN was present following all types of errors independent of who made the error and the outcome of the action. Consequently, the current study demonstrates that performance monitoring as reflected by the ERN is error-specific and not directly dependent on reward. © 2012 de Bruijn and von Rhein.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction. Event-related brain potentials (ERP) provide important information about the sensitivity of the brain to process varying risks. The aim of the present study was to determine how different risk levels are reflected in decision-related ERPs, namely the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and the P300. Material and Methods. 20 participants conducted a probabilistic two-choice gambling task while an electroencephalogram was recorded. Choices were provided between a low-risk option yielding low rewards and low losses and a high-risk option yielding high rewards and high losses. While options differed in expected risks, they were equal in expected values and in feedback probabilities. Results. At the behavioral level, participants were generally risk-averse but modulated their risk-taking behavior according to reward history. An early positivity (P200) was enhanced on negative feedbacks in high-risk compared to low-risk options. With regard to the FRN, there were significant amplitude differences between positive and negative feedbacks in high-risk options, but not in low-risk options. While the FRN on negative feedbacks did not vary with decision riskiness, reduced amplitudes were found for positive feedbacks in high-risk relative to low-risk choices. P300 amplitudes were larger in high-risk decisions, and in an additive way, after negative compared to positive feedback. Discussion. The present study revealed significant influences of risk and valence processing on ERPs. FRN findings suggest that the reward prediction error signal is increased after high risk decisions. The increased P200 on negative feedback in risky decisions suggests that large negative prediction errors are processed as early as in the P200 time range. The later P300 amplitude is sensitive to feedback valence as well as to the risk of a decision. Thus, the P300 carries additional information for reward processing, mainly the enhanced motivational significance of risky decisions. © 2012 Schuermann, Endrass and Kathmann.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Functional imaging studies examining the neural correlates of risk have mainly relied on paradigms involving exposure to simple chance gambles and an economic definition of risk as variance in the probability distribution over possible outcomes. However, there is little evidence that choices made during gambling tasks predict naturalistic risk-taking behaviors such as drug use, extreme sports, or even equity investing.To better understand the neural basis of naturalistic risk-taking, we scanned participants using fMRI while they completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task, an experimental measure that includes an active decision/choice component and that has been found to correlate with a number of naturalistic risk-taking behaviors. In the task, as in many naturalistic settings, escalating risk-taking occurs under uncertainty and might be experienced either as the accumulation of greater potential rewards, or as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value). We found that areas previously linked to risk and risk-taking (bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were activated as participants continued to inflate balloons. Interestingly, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity decreased as participants further expanded balloons. In light of previous findings implicating the vmPFC in value calculation, this result suggests that escalating risk-taking in the task might be perceived as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value) rather than the increasing potential total reward relative to the starting point of the trial. A better understanding of how neural activity changes with risk-taking behavior in the task offers insight into the potential neural mechanisms driving naturalistic risk-taking. © 2012 Schonberg, Fox, Mum-ford, Congdon, Trepel and Poldrack.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is in many respects the gold standard for demonstrating decision making in drug using groups. However, it is not clear how basic task properties such as the frequency and magnitude of rewards and losses affect choice behavior in drug users and even in healthy players. In this study, we used a variant of the IGT, the Soochow Gambling Task (SGT), to observe choice behavior in opiate users and healthy decision makers in a task where reward frequency is not confounded with the long-term outcome of each alternative. In both opiate users (n = 26) and healthy controls (n = 27), we show that reward frequency strongly influences choice behavior in the IGT and SGT. Neither group showed a consistent preference across tasks for alternatives with good long-term outcomes, but rather, subjects appeared to prefer alternatives that win most frequently. We interpret this as evidence to suggest that healthy players perform better than opiate users on the IGT because they are able to utilize gain-loss frequencies to guide their choice behavior on the task. This challenges the previous notion that poorer performance on the IGT in drug users is due to an inability to be guided by future consequences. © 2012 Upton, Kerestesand Stout.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Substantial evidence suggests people are risk-averse when making decisions described in terms of gains and risk-prone when making decisions described in terms of losses, a phenomenon known as the framing effect. Little research, however, has examined whether framing effects are a product of normative risk-sensitive cognitive processes. In 5 experiments, it is demonstrated that framing effects in the Asian disease problem can be explained by risk-sensitivity theory, which predicts that decision makers adjust risk acceptance on the basis of minimal acceptable thresholds, or need. Both explicit and self-determined need requirements eliminated framing effects and affected risk acceptance consistent with risk-sensitivity theory. Furthermore, negative language choice in loss frames conferred the perception of high need and led to the construction of higher minimal acceptable thresholds. The results of this study suggest that risk-sensitivity theory provides a normative rationale for framing effects based on sensitivity to minimal acceptable thresholds, or needs. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Gambling is a widespread recreational activity and requires pitting the values of potential wins and losses against their probability of occurrence. Neuropsychological research showed that betting behavior on laboratory gambling tasks is highly sensitive to focal lesions to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and insula. In the current study, we assessed the neural basis of betting choices in healthy participants, using functional magnetic resonance imaging of the Roulette Betting Task. In half of the trials, participants actively chose their bets; in the other half, the computer dictated the bet size. Our results highlight the impact of volitional choice upon gambling-related brain activity: Neural activity in a distributed network - including key structures of the reward circuitry (midbrain, striatum) - was higher during active compared to computer-dictated bet selection. In line with neuropsychological data, the anterior insula and vmPFC were more activated during self-directed bet selection, and responses in these areas were differentially modulated by the odds of winning in the two choice conditions. In addition, responses in the vmPFC and ventral striatum were modulated by the bet size. Convergent with electrophysiological research in macaques, our results further implicate the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) in the processing of the likelihood of potential outcomes: Neural responses in the IPC bilaterally reflected the probability of winning during bet selection. Moreover, the IPC was particularly sensitive to the odds of winning in the active-choice condition, when the processing of this information was required to guide bet selection. Our results indicate an important role of the IPC in human decision-making under risk and help to integrate neuropsychological data of risk-taking following vmPFC and insula damage with models of choice derived from human neuroimaging and monkey electrophysiology. © 2012 Studer, Apergis-Schoute, Robbins and Clark.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In real-world decision making, choice outcomes, and their probabilities are often not known a priori but must be learned from experience. The dopamine hypothesis of cognitive aging predicts that component processes of experience-based decision making (information search and stimulus-reward association learning) decline with age. Many existing studies in this domain have used complex neuropsychological tasks that are not optimal for testing predictions about specific cognitive processes. Here we used an experimental sampling paradigm with real monetary payoffs that provided separate measures of information search and choice for gains and losses. Compared with younger adults, older adults sought less information about uncertain risky options. However, like younger adults, older participants also showed evidence of adaptive decision making. When the desirable out-come of the risky option was rare (p = 0.10 or 0.20), both age groups engaged in more information search and made fewer risky choices, compared with when the desirable out-come of the risky option was frequent (p = 0.80 or 0.90). Furthermore, loss options elicited more sampling and greater modulation of risk taking, compared with gain options. Overall, these findings support predictions of the dopamine hypothesis of cognitive aging, but they also highlight the need for additional research into the interaction of age and valence (gain vs. loss) on experience-based choice. © 2012 Spaniol and Wegier.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Women of reproductive age are vulnerable to psychosocial problems, but these have remained largely unexplored in Muslim women in developing countries. The aim of this study was to explore and describe psychosocial impact and social support following perinatal loss among Muslim women.Methods: A qualitative study was conducted in a specialist centre among Muslim mothers who had experienced perinatal loss. Purposive sampling to achieve maximum variation among Muslims in relation to age, parity and previous perinatal death was used. Data was collected by focus group discussion and in-depth unstructured interview until the saturation point met. Sixteen mothers who had recent perinatal loss of wanted pregnancy, had received antenatal follow up from public or private health clinics, and had delivery in our centre participated for the study. All of them had experienced psychological difficulties including feelings of confusion, emptiness and anxiety over facing another pregnancy.Results: Two out of sixteen showed anger and one felt guilt. They reported experiencing a lack of communication and privacy in the hospital during the period of grief. Family members and friends play an important role in providing support. The majority agreed that the decision makers were husbands and families instead of themselves. The respondents felt that repetitive reminder of whatever happened was a test from God improved their sense of self-worth. They appreciated this reminder especially when it came from husband, family or friends closed to them.Conclusion: Muslim mothers who had experienced perinatal loss showed some level of adverse psychosocial impact which affected their feelings. Husbands and family members were the main decision makers for Muslim women. Health care providers should provide psychosocial support during antenatal, delivery and postnatal care. On-going support involving husband should be available where needed. © 2012 Sutan and Miskam; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: Contemporary theories of child physical abuse (CPA) emphasize the proximal role of social cognitive processes (many of which are implicit in nature) in the occurrence of parental aggression. However, methods that allow for the systematic examination of implicit cognitive processes during the course of aggressive interactions are needed. To address this need, the present study was designed to examine the utility of the Word Game, an innovative procedure designed to assess implicit changes in schema accessibility during the course of an interpersonal exchange involving aggressive response options. Methods: The game involves a series of competitive reaction time trials which are actually lexical decision making trials designed to determine the accessibility of schema throughout the game. Each parent was led to believe that they were competing against another player with whom they exchanged sound blasts of varying intensities. Participants in the present study were parents who were either low (n=50) or high (n=20) risk for CPA. Results: Results revealed that high CPA risk parents behaved more aggressively than low CPA risk parents and that provocation augmented the aggressiveness of all participants. Among high CPA risk parents, positive schema became less accessible (whereas negative schema became more accessible) following lost rounds. At the conclusion of the game, high CPA risk parents reported more aggressive motives than low CPA risk parents. Further, aggressive motives significantly mediated the association between CPA risk status and aggressiveness (i.e., mean sound blast selections). Conclusions: Collectively, results support the potential utility of the Word Game as a means of advancing the study of social cognitive processes involved in parental aggression. © 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Since the peace agreement has put an end to the 30-year-long civil conflict in the province of Aceh in Indonesia, poverty, parental loss, lack of opportunities and an old tradition have caused a growing number of Acehnese girls and boys to spend between three and ten years in residential Koranic schools [dayah or pesantren]. There, they process their experience of the conflict, be it direct or indirect. In this article, thanks to ethnographical data, the author explores this labour of transformation. An idea of resilience which is culturally based in local societies is analysed. Key issues are the difference between personal and social resilience, plus the transformations that a resilient process enhances in the very culture from which it stems. The dayah have proved very effective structures in facing the needs of the poorest Acehnese children. Nevertheless, the author argues, they tend to shape the children according to a general model that can create exclusion and crystallize pre-existing psychic suffering.

      "Abstract: We compared the original deck-based model of advantageous decision making assessed with the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) with a trial-based approach across behavioral and physiological outcomes in 33 younger adults (15 men, 18 women; 22.2 ± 3.7 years of age). One administration of the IGT with simultaneous measurement of skin conductance responses (SCRs) was performed and the two methods applied: (a) the original approach of subtracting disadvantageous picks of Decks A and B from advantageous picks of Decks C and D and (b) a trial-based approach focused on the financial outcome for each deck leading up to the trial in question. When directly compared, the deck-based approach resulted in a more advantageous behavioral profile than did the trial-based approach. Analysis of SCR data revealed no significant differences between methods for physiological measurements of SCR fluctuations or anticipatory responses to disadvantageous picks. Post hoc investigation of the trial-based method revealed Deck B contributed to both advantageous and disadvantageous decision making for the majority of participants. When divided by blocks of 20, the number of advantageous to disadvantageous choices reversed as the task progressed despite the total number of picks from Deck B remaining high. SCR fluctuations for Deck B, although not significantly different from the other decks, did show a sharp decline after the first block of 20 and remained below levels for Decks C and D toward the end of the task, suggesting that participants may have gained knowledge of the frequency of loss for this deck. © 2011 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We use contingent valuation (CV) and choice experiment (CE) methods to assess cattle farmers' attitudes to and willingness to pay (WTP) for a bovine tuberculosis (bTB) cattle vaccine, to help inform vaccine development and policy. A survey questionnaire was administered by means of telephone interviews to a stratified sample of 300 cattle farmers in annually bTB-tested areas in England and Wales. Farmers felt that bTB was a major risk for the cattle industry and that there was a high risk of their cattle getting the disease. The CE estimate produced a mean WTP of £35 per animal per single dose for a vaccine that is 90% effective at reducing the risk of a bTB breakdown and an estimated £55 for such a vaccine backed by 100% insurance of loss if a breakdown should occur. The CV estimate produced a mean WTP of nearly £17 per dose/per animal/per year for a vaccine (including 100% insurance) which, given the average lifespan of cattle, is comparable to the CE estimate. These WTP estimates are substantially higher than the expected cost of a vaccine which suggests that farmers in high risk bTB 'hotspot' areas perceive a substantial net benefit from buying the vaccine. © 2011 The Agricultural Economics Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present research examines the role of allocations of losses versus gains on the emergence of unethical behavior as a function of people's social value orientation. The authors demonstrate that (a) proselfs regard unethical behavior to prevent losses as more justified than prosocials (Study 1) and (b) proselfs engage in more unethical behavior to prevent losses than prosocials (Study 2). These differences are explained by prosocials' greater concern for harm to interdependent others in the domain of losses. A third study further substantiates these findings by revealing that unethical behavior to prevent losses increases among prosocials as harm to others is reduced. In sum, these results reveal that depending on whether people attend only to their self-interest or also consider the outcomes of others, losses either may increase or curtail unethical conduct. Considering social value orientations thus may reconcile conflicting theoretical perspectives on the impact of losses on social decisions. © 2012 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: Takeovers create a potential conflict of interest between target shareholders and directors. While mergers generally create value for the target shareholders, their directors will typically lose their board seats and likely face a financial loss or loss of prestige. The purpose of this paper is to examine evidence to support or refute that directors may act in their own best interests at the expense of shareholders. Design/methodology/approach: The authors reason that if directors act in their own best interests, then acquiring firms will seek targets with older board members who are closer to director retirement and are therefore less reluctant to give up their board seats. The paper uses data of 528 banks between 1999 and 2004 to estimate logistic regressions controlling for variables relevant to takeover probability. In the hypotheses, the authors test for the significance of the average director age on a board. Findings: The paper finds a highly positive significant relation between the average age of a board of directors and the probability of takeover. Furthermore, this variable is more robust and has greater explanatory power in predicting takeover targets than all other financial, ownership and governance variables commonly controlled for and included in this study. This suggests that older directors are less prone to agency problems and more willing to make decisions that will likely result in the loss of their board seat. Practical implications: These findings have important policy implications on director retirement policies such as director age versus term limits. The results also have implications on the use of director golden parachutes. Finally, the authors highlight a strategic consideration for acquiring firms seeking takeover targets. Originality/value: This paper is the first, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to document board age as an important governance characteristic. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Online retailers significantly benefit when consumers use interactive decision aids (IDAs). In this study, we investigate how to best design messages that promote IDA use. Using an extended message framing perspective, we propose that messages about consumers' traditional action (searching) increase usage intentions more than messages about the new action (IDA use). Results from two experiments confirm that this holds across both high and low involvement categories and in particular when the traditional action frame is combined with a loss outcome. We also demonstrate that familiarity with the message's focal action mediates this effect. © 2011 New York University.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper addresses three questions: (1) When deciding on whether to reward or punish someone, how does how you think others expect you to behave affect your decision? (2) Does it depend upon whether others expect you to reward them vs. punish them? (3) What is the interpretation of such a causal effect? We investigate these questions using a modification of the lost wallet trust game (a simplified version of the trust game) that permits punishment. Like previous studies, we collect data on what second-movers think that first-movers expect them to do by directly eliciting the second-movers' expectations. Unlike previous studies, we ensure exogeneity of these expectations by instrumenting for them. The instrument is the expectations of neutral observers which are disclosed to second-movers prior to the elicitation of second-movers' expectations. We find that what you think others expect you to do has a zero causal effect on both reward and punishment decisions. We also find that it is important to instrument for second-order expectations because they are endogenous. We interpret these findings in terms of models of guilt-aversion and intentional reciprocity. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Regret and relief are related to counterfactual thinking and rely on comparison processes between what has been and what might have been. In this article, we study the development of regret and relief from late childhood to adulthood (11.2-20.2. years), and we examine how these two emotions affect individuals' willingness to retrospectively reconsider their choice in a computerized monetary gambling task. We asked participants to choose between two \"wheels of fortune\" that differed in the amount of gain and loss expected and the probability of winning. We manipulated the outcome of the wheel of fortune that was not selected by participants to induce regret or relief. For each trial, participants rated how they felt about the outcome and their willingness to modify their choice. Participants' ratings suggest that regret and relief are stronger in adults than in children and adolescents. Regret affects participants' willingness to modify their initial choice, but this desire is stronger for adults than for children. In children, the experience of regret seems to be dissociated from the willingness to reconsider a choice. This study provides the first evidence that the ability to experience counterfactually mediated emotions, such as regret and relief, and the ability to take them into consideration continue to develop during late childhood and adolescence. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Choices are necessary and inevitable in resource management, and these inherently create losers and gainers. The benefits and beneficiaries from plans and schemes to reduce flooding have been researched over many years, but the losers have been almost completely neglected. We would define these as including both those who pay for flood risk management but gain nothing or little from these interventions, and those whose financial situation is adversely affected if flood risk management reduces the number and severity of the flood events that are to be faced. This paper describes research that explores these issues and seeks both to identify these losers, so defined, and to quantify the extent of their 'loss'. We conclude that while we may not be concerned about the loss suffered by the general taxpayer or insurance premium payer, as the sums are small per household (although very large in total), we certainly should be concerned about other groups who either lose money or lose protection as a result of decisions to reduce risk generally and in specific local examples. These findings should not deter us from continuing to seek risk reduction through wise flood risk management but they should alert us to the fact that this brings losers as well as winners, and that the former deserve much more careful attention than has been the case in the past. © 2012 The Authors.

      "Abstract: In this paper, I develop a socioeconomic model that can be used to investigate the decisions made by professional athletes concerning doping. In their evaluation of whether to use performance-enhancing drugs, athletes consider not only costs and benefits (through rank improvement) but also the approval from fellow athletes toward pro-doping decisions. Peer-group approval is modeled as a lagged endogenous variable, depending on the share of doping athletes in the history of a sport. As such, the model can explain an equilibrium of high incidence of doping as a \"doping culture\". In addition to presenting comparative statics of the equilibrium (i.e., in order to answer the question of how a doping culture can be eliminated), I also investigate how doping decisions are affected by the standards set by the leader in a sport (e.g., Olympic qualification marks), and by the disproportionate public veneration of winners. © 2012 The editors of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics.\u001b[0m :\n",

The study develops a method to estimate the effects of the controls by combining three different models: a 2SLS regression model, a random-utility-based location choice model and a transport model. The most important findings are the aggregate annual economic costs and transport benefits of the controls: a $45.9 billion output and 336 000 job losses versus $4.8 billion in transport cost savings. These empirical findings indicate that the citizens of the Seoul metropolitan region would be better off economically, with more job opportunities, in the absence of the industrial development controls, and would pay relatively minor transport costs for these benefits. © 2011 Urban Studies Journal Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Value-based choices are influenced both by risk in potential outcomes and by whether outcomes reflect potential gains or losses. These variables are held to be related in a specific fashion, manifest in risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses. Instead, we hypothesized that there are independent impacts of risk and loss on choice such that, depending on context, subjects can show either risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses or the exact opposite. We demonstrate this independence in a gambling task, by selectively reversing aloss-induced effect(causing more gambling for gains than losses and the reverse)while leaving risk a version unaffected. Consistent with these dissociable behavioral impacts of risk and loss, fMRI data revealed dissociable neural correlates of these variables, with parietal cortex tracking risk and orbitofrontal cortex and striatum tracking loss. Based on our neural data, we hypothesized that risk and loss influence action selection through approach-avoidance mechanisms, a hypothesis supported in an experiment in which we show valence and risk-dependent reaction time effects in line with this putative mechanism. We suggest that in the choice process risk and loss can independently engage approach-avoidance mechanisms. This can provide a novel explanation for how risk influences action selection and explains both classically described choice behavior as well as behavioral patterns not predicted by existing theory. © 2012 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The influence of monetary loss on decision making and choice behavior is extensively studied. However, the effect of loss on sensory perception is less explored. Here, we use conditioning in human subjects to explore how monetary loss associated with a pure tone can affect changesinperceptualthresholdsforthepreviouslyneutralstimulus.Wefoundthatloss conditioning, whencompared withneutral exposure, decreases sensitivity and increases perceptual thresholds (i.e., a relative increase inthe just-noticeable-difference). This was so even when compared with gain conditioning of comparable intensity, suggesting that the finding is related to valence. We further show that these perceptual changes are related to future decisions about stimuli that are farther away from the conditioned one (wider generalization), resulting in overall increased and irrational monetary loss for the subjects. We use functional imaging to identify the neural network whose activity correlates with the deterioration in sensitivity on an individual basis. In addition, we show that activity in theamygdala was tightly correlated with the wider behavioralgeneralization, namely, whenwrongdecisions were made.Wesuggestthat, in principle, less discrimination can be beneficial in loss scenarios, because it assures an accurate and fast response to stimuli that resemble the original stimulus and hence haveahigh likelihoodofentailingthesameoutcome.Butwhereas this canbeuseful forprimary reinforcers that can impact survival, it can also underlie wrong and costly behaviors in scenarios of contemporary life that involve secondary reinforcers. © 2012 the authors.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present study investigated the temporal features of processing facial attractiveness, and its influence on the subsequent cooperative behavior. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded for both face stimuli (attractive or unattractive faces) and feedback stimuli (loss or gain) while participants performed a modified trust game task, in which participants decided whether to cooperate with fictional partners (attractive or unattractive faces) for a chance to earn monetary rewards; feedback (loss or gain) were presented after their decisions. The behavioral results showed that participants were more likely to cooperate with the attractive partners than with the unattractive partners. The ERP analysis for face stimuli showed that a smaller P2 amplitude was elicited by attractive faces compared to unattractive faces. In addition, attractive faces elicited larger N2 and smaller late positive component (LPC) amplitudes than unattractive faces. More interestingly, a larger feedback related negativity (FRN) was elicited within the attractive face condition compared with the unattractive face condition. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that the discrimination of attractive and unattractive faces occurs at the early P2 stage, reflecting automatic processing of facial attractiveness. Moreover, the present study further demonstrates that facial attractiveness facilitates cooperative behavior, and that FRN elicited by outcome stimuli might be used as an index of how people judge and predict another's behavior in a social game. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

When distributing money between gambles with equal probabilities, people often invest in turning negative gambles into positive ones, even at a cost of reduced expected value. Results of an experiment revealed that (1) the preference to turn a negative outcome into a positive outcome exists when people's ability to do so depends on their performance levels (rather than merely on their choice), (2) this preference is amplified when the likelihood to turn negative into positive is high rather than low, and (3) this preference is attenuated when people can lie about their performance levels, allowing them to turn negative into positive not by performing better but rather by lying about how well they performed.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We analyze behavior in two basic classes of decision tasks: description-based and experience-based. In particular, we compare the prediction power of a number of decision learning models in both kinds of tasks. Unlike most previous studies, we focus on individual, rather than aggregate, behavioral characteristics. We carry out an experiment involving a battery of both description- and experience-based choices between two mixed binary prospects made by each of the participants, and employ a number of formal models for explaining and predicting participants' choices: Prospect theory (PT) (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979); Expectancy-Valence model (EVL) (Busemeyer & Stout, 2002); and three combinations of these well-established models. We document that the PT and the EVL models are best for predicting people's decisions in description- and experience-based tasks, respectively, which is not surprising as these two models are designed specially for these kinds of tasks. Furthermore, we find that models involving linear weighting of gains and losses perform better in both kinds of tasks, from the point of view of generalizability and individual parameter consistency. We therefore, conclude that, overall, when both prospects are mixed, the assumption of diminishing sensitivity does not improve models' prediction power for individual decision-makers. Finally, for some of the models' parameters, we document consistency at the individual level between description- and experience-based tasks.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of the study is to describe the style of thinking about doping among risk-takers and risk-avoiders in three hypothetical situations varying according to the level of objective probability of an anti-doping test. A group of competitive athletes was assessed (N=23; modern pentathlon), mean age ~16.7 years, mean experience in sport 8 years. As the criterion for categorisation of athletes into risk-takers (N-6) and risk-avoiders (N-9), the scope of personally accepted risk in a situation of very high probability of an anti-doping test was assumed. An experimental technique developed for the use of these studies was applied to measure: 1) individual hierarchy of values possible to be lost as a consequence of using doping; 2) personally accepted level of risk of losing values in the three experimental situations: a) low objective risk (2 to 10), b) medium objective risk (5 to 10), c) high objective risk (8 to 10). In the attitude of the risk-avoiders the reluctance to risk the loss of each studied value grows together with the increase of the objective danger until the critical moment that they do not exceed (null risk tolerance). In the style of thinking of the risk-avoiders about doping, a logical translation occurs between what they value most and what they protect most. In the attitude of the risk-takers there is no such translation, and moreover, together with the increase of the objective danger of losing the valued goods, the readiness to sacrifice them as the result of the risky decisions does not weaken. The true character of a risk-taker and the personal need to take risks is revealed most strongly under circumstances of a high probability of losing the mostly highly valued goods. The risk-avoiders value their emotional health significantly more highly than do the risk-takers, while for the risk-takers winning medals is valued significantly more highly.

      "Abstract: The overall objective of this study was to examine the relationship between executive function, specifically decision-making, and weight loss. We used the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to characterize decision-making and compared performance on this task to weight loss in obese women (n = 29) participating in a 12-week controlled, calorie-reduced intervention. We hypothesized that a greater amount of weight loss over the course of the intervention would be associated with better performance on the IGT, assessed at the end of the intervention. The intervention led to significant weight loss of 5.8 ± 3.1. kg (p < 0.05) and fat loss of 5.1 ± 3.0. kg (p < 0.05). Body weight and fat mass losses over the 12-week intervention varied widely, ranging from -12.5. kg to 0.0. kg for body weight and -10.4. kg to +. 0.8. kg for fat mass. A greater amount of body weight loss was correlated (r = 0.425; p < 0.01) with a higher total score on the IGT. Similarly, the reduction in body fat mass was also correlated with the IGT score (r = 0.408; p < 0.05). We examined other physiological (salivary cortisol), metabolic (resting energy expenditure), and behavioral (food intake; dietary restraint) factors that might be related to differences in the magnitude of weight loss. Of these variables, ad libitum consumption of energy, fat and protein during a buffet meal was inversely related to weight loss (r = -0.428; p < 0.05; r = -0.375; p < 0.05 and r = -0.472; p = 0.01, respectively). The present study is the first to report an association between diet-induced weight loss and performance on the IGT, and this association was specific to the loss of body fat. Our results suggest that differences in weight loss may be linked to executive function that involves decision-making about events that have emotionally or socially salient ramifications. These findings underscore the need to further investigate higher cognitive and neuroendocrine pathways that may influence or be altered by the process of dieting and weight loss. © 2011.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of the study was to examine longitudinal patterns of decision making based on risk and reward using a modified version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) in children who had sustained traumatic brain injury (TBI) and children with orthopedic injury (OI). Participants were 135 children and adolescents with TBI (n=. 71) or OI (n=. 64) who were 7-17 years at the time of injury were enrolled and assessed prospectively at baseline and at follow-up intervals of 3, 12, 18, and 24 months after injury. Groups were similar in age, socioeconomic status, and gender. Participants chose from four decks of cards with the aim of maximizing earnings across 100 trials. Two of the decks offered relatively small rewards and relatively small losses, but were advantageous over the course of the experiment. The other two decks offered large rewards, but also introduced occasional large losses, and were considered disadvantageous over the course of the experiment. The variable of interest was the proportion of advantageous decks chosen across trials.Longitudinal analysis of the pattern of change across 2 years revealed a three-way interaction among injury group, age, and the quadratic term of interval-since-injury. In this interaction, the effect of age weakened in the TBI group across time, as compared to the OI group, which showed stronger quadratic patterns across the recovery intervals that differed by age. The OI group generally outperformed the TBI group.In addition, analyses revealed a three-way interaction among group, gender and the cubic term of post-injury interval, such that overall, males improved a great deal with time, but females showed small gains, regardless of injury group. © 2011 ISDN.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When someone is told: \"it is possible that you will lose your investment\", \"possible\" can be interpreted as plainly reflecting the speaker's degree of certainty (i.e., likelihood-communication device) or as tactfully communicating the probable occurrence of losses (i.e., hearer-face-management device). We suggest that risk quantifiers can also serve the speaker's interest by decreasing the chance of being blamed for an incorrect wrongful prediction (i.e., speaker-face-management device). In five experiments, we investigate how individuals interpret risk quantifiers and the effect of their interpretations on risk perception. Results show that speaker-face-management is the most frequent interpretation in both negative and positive outcome predictions, for different probability terms, and in different cultures. Results consistently show that device interpretation determines risk judgment, negativity perceptions and decision making. Results are discussed within the framework of politeness theory and implications for risk communication are reviewed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Diabetes is a very common and serious chronic disease, and one of the fastest growing disease burdens in the United States. Further, health behaviors, such as exercise, smoking, drinking, as well as weight status, are instrumental to diabetes management and the reduction of its medical consequences. Nine waves of the Health and Retirement Study are used to model the role of a recent diabetes diagnosis and medication on present and subsequent weight status, exercise, drinking and smoking activity. Several non-linear dynamic population average probit models are estimated. Results suggest that compared to non-diagnosed individuals at risk for high blood sugar, diagnosed diabetics respond initially in terms of increasing exercise, losing weight, and curbing smoking and drinking behavior, but the effect diminishes after diagnosis. Evidence of recidivism is also found in these outcomes, especially weight status and physical activity, suggesting that some behavioral responses to diabetes may be short-lived. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Determining how living beings react to tasks that reflect realistic situations of risk has given rise to a vast literature. However, I argue that the methodologies traditionally used to test humans and nonhumans relative to risk often fail to achieve their goal. When risk is modelled in laboratory, potential decision cost (or potential loss) typically denotes an absence of optimal gain. In contrast, when risk occurs in real-life situations, potential loss denotes the reduction in an individual's limited resources - whether energetic, social, financial, etc. This conceptual difference about the nature of risk may have important implications for the understanding of the parameters that control risk-taking behaviour. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper presents a goods and services approach to determine the economic value of Paracentrotus lividus with the aim of clarifying the role of valuation in the management and conservation of marine biodiversity. More specifically, it uses the Contingent Valuation Method to estimate the existence value of the sea urchin population that is predicted to be lost in the future if we do not take any measure today to protect them. According to the results a great number of respondents were willing to pay for the conservation of P. lividus population. Moreover, individual characteristics have distinctively different effects for explaining responders behaviour against their conservation. The empirical results from the proposed models link individuals opinion about eco-nomic value of biodiversity with people total willingness to pay (WTP). The results would help the choice of management strategies for P. lividus conservation and can help design incentive schemes to make conservation policy both effective and efficient.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Expected Utility theory is not only applied to individual choices but also to social decisions, e.g. in cost-benefit analysis of climate change policy measures that affect future generations and hence incorporate an ethical dimension. In this context the crucial question arises whether EU theory is able to deal with \"catastrophic risks\", i.e. risks of high, but very unlikely losses, in an ethically appealing way. In this paper we show that this is not the case. Rather, if in the framework of EU theory a plausible level of risk aversion is assumed, a \"tyranny of catastrophic risk\" (TCR) emerges, i.e. project evaluation is dominated by the catastrophic event. Or, contrary to that, with low degrees of risk aversion, the catastrophic risk eventually has no impact at all (\"negligence of catastrophic risk\" (NCR)) which is ethically not acceptable as well. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Adaptive behavior requires choosing effectively between options involving risks and potential rewards. Existing studies implicate lateral and medial prefrontal areas, striatum, insula, amygdala and parietal regions in specific aspects of decision-making. However, limited attention is given to how brain networks encode economic parameters in patterns of inter-regional interactions. Here, healthy participants underwent functional MRI while evaluating \"mixed\" gambles presenting potential gains, losses and associated outcome probabilities. Connectivity graphs were constructed from analyses of psychophysiological interactions across a comprehensive atlas of brain regions. Expected value correlated positively with activity within medial prefrontal and occipital cortices, and modulated effective connectivity across a network that extended substantially beyond these nodes. Value-sensitive effective connections were found to be arranged as a unitary, small world network in which medial and anterior-lateral prefrontal areas featured as hubs, characterized by dense connectivity and high shortest-path centrality. Further analyses revealed that the observed effective connectivity effects were more pertinent to dichotomous gain/loss comparisons than to continuous value determination. Factoring expected value into its constituent components, potential loss modulated connectivity across a subset of the value-sensitive network, whereas potential gain and outcome probability were not significantly embodied in functional interactions. Regional response non-linearity was excluded as an artifactual basis to the observed effects, and directionality inferences were confirmed by comparison of dynamic causal models. Our findings extend current literature demonstrating that the representation of value is dependent on distributed processing taking across a widespread network which feeds information into a limited set of integrative prefrontal nodes. This study also has more general paradigmatic implications for neuroeconomics, demonstrating the value of explicit modeling of inter-regional interactions for understanding the neural substrates of decisional processes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Somali migrants fleeing the civil war in their country face punishing journeys, the loss of homes, possessions, and bereavement. On arrival in the host country they encounter poverty, hostility, and residential instability which may also undermine their mental health. Methods. An in-depth and semi-structured interview was used to gather detailed accommodation histories for a five year period from 142 Somali migrants recruited in community venues and primary care. Post-codes were verified and geo-mapped to calculate characteristics of residential location including deprivation indices, the number of moves and the distances between residential moves. We asked about the reasons for changing accommodation, perceived discrimination, asylum status, traumatic experiences, social support, employment and demographic factors. These factors were assessed alongside characteristics of residential mobility as correlates of ICD-10 psychiatric disorders. Results: Those who were forced to move homes were more likely to have an ICD-10 psychiatric disorder (OR = 2.64, 1.16-5.98, p = 0.02) compared with those moving through their own choice. A lower risk of psychiatric disorders was found for people with larger friendship networks (0.35, 0.14-0.84, p = 0.02), for those with more confiding emotional support (0.42, 0.18-1.0, p = 0.05), and for those who had not moved during the study period (OR = 0.21, 0.07-0.62, p = 0.01). Conclusions: Forced residential mobility is a risk factor for psychiatric disorder; social support may contribute to resilience against psychiatric disorders associated with residential mobility. © 2012 Bhui et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is characterized by muscle damage and progressive loss of muscle function in male children. DMD is one of the most devastating genetically linked neuromuscular diseases for which there is currently no cure. Most clinical studies for DMD utilize a standard protocol for measurement exploring pathophysiology, muscle strength and timed tasks. However, we propose that examining broader components of health as emphasized by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health- Children and Youth Version (ICF-CY) may be of great value to children and their families, and important outcomes for future clinical trials. Methods: Fifty boys with DMD and 25 unaffected age-matched boys completed two self-report measures: the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory TM 4.0. We investigated differences between the two groups with regard to participation in life activities and perceived quality of life (QoL). Additionally, we compared participation in activities and QoL in both cohorts of younger and older boys. Results: Participation in physical activities was significantly lower in boys with DMD than unaffected boys. Perceived QoL was markedly diminished in children with DMD relative to unaffected controls, except in the emotional domain. The amount of time boys engage in an activity, as well as participation in social activities, declined for our older boys with DMD but no changes were observed for our older unaffected boys. For both groups, QoL remained constant over time. Conclusions: The ICF-CY provides a conceptual framework and specific terminology that facilitates investigation of the consequences of impairment in children and youth. Our study is one of the first to explore participation in a cohort of boys with DMD. It was not surprising that activities of choice for boys with DMD were less physical in nature than unaffected boys their age, but the consequences of less social engagement as the boys with DMD age is of great concern. Results from our study underscore the need to further evaluate activities that children elect to participate in, with special emphasis on facilitators and barriers to participation and how participation changes throughout the course of a disease. © 2012 Bendixen et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Youth with conduct problems (CP) often make decisions which value self-interest over the interests of others. Self-benefiting behavior despite loss to others is especially common among youth with CP and callous-unemotional traits (CU). Such behavioral tendencies are generally measured using self- or observer-report. We are unaware of attempts to measure this tendency with a behavioral paradigm. Methods/Principal Findings: In our AlAn's (altruism-antisocial) game a computer program presents subjects with a series of offers in which they will receive money but a planned actual charity donation will be reduced; subjects decide to accept or reject each offer. We tested (1) whether adolescent patients with CP (n = 20) compared with adolescent controls (n = 19) differed on AlAn's game outcomes, (2) whether youths with CP and CU differed significantly from controls without CP or CU, and (3) whether AlAn's game outcomes correlated significantly with CP and separately, CU severity. Patients with CP and CU compared with controls without these problems took significantly more money for themselves and left significantly less money in the charity donation; AlAn's game outcomes were significantly correlated with CU, but not CP. Conclusions/Significance: In the AlAn's game adolescents with conduct problems and CU traits, compared with controls without CP/CU, are disposed to benefit themselves while costing others even in a novel situation, devoid of peer influences, where anonymity is assured, reciprocity or retribution are impossible, intoxication is absent and when the \"other\" to be harmed is considered beneficent. AlAn's game outcomes are associated with measures of CU. Results suggest that the AlAn's game provides an objective means of capturing information about CU traits. The AlAn's game, which was designed for future use in the MRI environment, may be used in studies attempting to identify the neural correlates of self-benefiting decision-making. © 2012 Sakai et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In recent times, rapid advances in the field of information technology have enabled firms selling information products (for example, in the form of a CD) to provide subscription services using remote servers. Making the product versus service decision involves a trade-off. Online subscription offerings are perceived to be of lower quality because of data security and network reliability issues but can reduce or even eliminate the credible commitment (of prices) problem typically faced by firms selling durable products. We model an infinite horizon game between two symmetric firms that choose the design architecture, that is, product or service (and consequent contracting scheme: selling or subscription) and then set prices to optimize profits. The perceived quality loss enables firms to differentiate based on design architecture/ contracting scheme and make positive profits. Further, the firm that sells a product makes higher profit than the firm that offers a subscription service. However, as the discount factor increases, the presence of a seller leads to a credible commitment problem for both firms leading to a reduction in prices. The results offer an explanation for the persistence of firms selling products rather than services. Further, a firm offering a subscription service may be subject to price pressure due to the price commitment issues of a competing seller. We also extend our insights to other settings: one involving asymmetric firms and the other involving different discount rates for product quality and producer/consumer surplus. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Recent studies have shown the existence of a relationship between sleep and moral judgment. In this study, we investigated whether one night of sleep deprivation affects the ability to judge the appropriateness of moral dilemmas. Forty-eight students had to judge 30 moral dilemmas at test, after a night of home sleep, and another 30 dilemmas at retest, following one night of continuous wakefulness. The 60 dilemmas (20 moral impersonal, 20 moral personal, and 20 non-moral) were selected from Greene's dilemmas. Both groups judged the appropriateness of personal and impersonal dilemmas in the same way. A close to significant effect of sleep deprivation was observed on the reaction times for impersonal moral dilemmas, to which the deprived subjects responded faster (p = .05) than the control subjects. However, this was not the case for personal ones, for which no difference was significant. This result shows a greater ease/speed in responding to the (impersonal) dilemmas, which induce low emotional engagement after sleep deprivation, although the willingness to accept moral violations is not affected. This suggests that one night of sleep loss selectively influences the response speed only for moral impersonal dilemmas, probably due to disinhibition processes. The quality of moral judgment dilemmas does not seem to be easily influenced by a single night of sleep deprivation, but only by a longer lack of sleep. © 2012 Copyright 2012 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Involuntary culling (IC) is where a cow is disposed of due to injury, poor health or infertility. The main reasons for IC are infertility, mastitis and lameness. These reasons have differing age profiles in when they affect cows, cost variable amounts to treat and have an effect on the value of the cow at market. They also reduce cow welfare in different ways. These factors influence the economically optimum cow replacement decision, which must balance the risks of future loss from the current cow against its future prospects and the net costs of a replacement. So the farmer's economic decision as to when to cull a cow may not occur at the same time as when the cow could, and sometimes should, be culled to maximise her welfare. To explore this dilemma, we developed a Dynamic Programme (DP) model to assess the optimum replacement policies for each of 180 possible cow states (12 parities and 15 milkyield levels) under a simplified set of alternative husbandry systems and remedial practices. The DP was used to explore the relationships between financial outcomes, investment in improving welfare, lifespan and IC in dairy systems. There is a trade-off between dairy cattle lifespan and risk of suffering over which farmers have some control by the replacement and investment decisions they make. Our results show that improving cow welfare by reducing mastitis, lameness or infertility over the long term increases the mean longevity of the herd and also reduces the potential of long-term suffering resulting from chronic conditions. Additionally, it has the effect of increasing replacement opportunities and the annuities for each cow (£ per cow per year) mainly by increasing milk yield and reducing costly on-farm culls, creating a win-win situation for both farmer and cow.\u001b[0m :\n",

The authors show that overconfident investors tend to trade in greater volumes and exhibit stronger disposition effect. Previous research has shown disposition effect to be an outcome of loss aversion and lack of self-control, and this article shows that the disposition effect is also caused by emotions such as pride and shame, which shows up to a greater degree in overconfident people. Overconfident consumers are prone to realize gains early, in order to feel pride and hold on to losing stocks because admitting losses creates shame. It is also shown that overconfident investors trade in greater volumes and have greater illusion of control. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In a retrospective study, we investigated the reasons why women accepted to undergo a nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM) and why women who could not keep their nipple areola complex (NAC) decided to reconstruct it. We intended to investigate whether keeping the NAC plays a psychological role, to state possible advantages of NSM. Between 2004 and 2006, 310 women with NAC sparing and 143 patients with successive NAC reconstruction were mailed a single open-ended question at follow-up 12 months after final breast reconstruction surgery or final NAC reconstruction with tattoo. The purpose was to explore personal motivations that drove women to accept NSM or to perform a NAC tattoo reconstruction. Responses were classified into 11 categories by five reviewers. We performed an analysis of the relative frequency of emerging issues. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected. Among the patients who responded to the open-ended question, 190 patients preserved their NAC, and 100 patients received postponed NAC reconstruction. Women in the NSM group were significantly younger (P = 0.02), more highly educated (P< 0.0001), and more frequently lived in Northern Italy (P = 0.03). The reasons for accepting NSM were more frequently related to body image satisfaction and integrity of the body (P = 0.002), reduction of psychological distress (P = 0.003), and surgeon's influence (P<0.0001). Esthetic reasons were highly associated to the control group. These results help us to better understand the psychological impact of NAC sparing versus NAC reconstruction. NSM was accepted because it was perceived as a technique that preserved the integrity of the body, reduced the feeling of mutilation, improved the breast cosmetic results, and reduced psychological distress regarding the loss of the breast. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.\u001b[0m :\n",

Our analysis covered an investment set containing the components of the S&P500 index from 1993 to 2008. Optimizations were performed according to the classic mean-variance approach, while sustainability constraints were introduced by eliminating, from the investment pool, those assets that do not comply with the given social responsibility criteria (screening). We compared the efficient frontiers with and without screening. The analysis focused on the three main dimensions of sustainability, namely the environmental, social and governance ones. We found that socially responsible screening gives rise to a small loss in terms of the Sharpe ratio even though it has a great impact on the market capitalization of the optimal portfolio. The spanning test showed that the ex-post differences between the two frontiers, when short selling is not allowed, are significant only in the case of environmental screening. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this paper, we study contracts with two-sided incomplete information. Prior literature on contract remedies does not formally account for the nonbreaching party's option to not sue for damages upon breach, when her expected payoff from suing is negative, given the contractual terms and her private information about her post-breach loss. With this option incorporated into the analysis, we show that: First, courts should commit to awarding fixed damages, because awarding flexible damages based on ex post information will distort the incentives to breach. This result is not driven by the information-forcing effect of basing damages on ex ante expectations, la Hadley vs. Baxendale, rather it is driven by the endogenous decision to litigate breach. Second, the option of acquiescing to the breach expands the breach set under specific performance, which can be more efficient than other remedies. Third, the efficiency advantage of ex ante expectation damages over ex post actual damages is further enhanced when we account for the possibility of renegotiation. © 2009 The Author.

This paper aims to address this issue. Design/methodology/approach: This study suggests an integrated framework for earthquake consequences management. The framework consists of earthquake consequences model, value analysis, and socio-economic analysis, as well as dynamic integration for implementing strategies, policies, and plans. Findings: The developed integrated framework for earthquakes consequences management could be used for a study area especially in developing countries in which human and capital resources are limited. Research limitations/implications: There is a need to have different case studies to demonstrate how the integrated framework for earthquake consequence management could reduce human and monetary losses due to earthquakes for a study area.

In particular, it has been shown that people exhibit time-inconsistent behavior when making intertemporal decisions, i.e., they demand higher interest rates for a delay of their consumption in the near rather than in the distant future. People also show loss aversion. They demand more compensation for a loss than they are willing to sacrifice for a gain. We analyze these features for the nonmonetary decision of the amount of time invested in learning hours before an exam. Asked at two different points in time, the students were willing to learn more when the time of learning seemed far away than when the learning time had arrived. On the other hand, students were loss averse trying to prevent a deterioration of their grade to a larger extent than when they tried to work for an amelioration. © 2012, Decision Sciences Institute Journal compilation ©2012, Decision Sciences Institute.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Ironically in the twenty-first century, developing countries face a pile of ever increasing burden on health care facilities. The lack of political will, redundant health policies, mismanaged health care system, and grossly inadequate health care infrastructure along with battery of other local factors, have fuelled the crisis. People depend largely on government hospitals for basic health care facilities, which usually remain saturated and long queues are a customary sight. The tremendous increase in dependence over government hospitals has drained the already fatigued heath service. Under such an ambience, the people involved are often constrained to take decisions which though look agonizingly unethical, yet are defended by demand of situation. The authors present their view point under the ambit of \"Situation Ethics\" in an incident, reported in newspaper highlighting the plight of a victim who met with a train accident at district Malda, State of West Bengal, India, and lost both his legs, which were securely tucked under his head as 'pillow' giving a grisly sight unbecoming in an hospital situation.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Humans are unique among primates due to a lack of typical thermally insulating fur. The ectoparasite avoidance mediated by the mate choice hypothesis suggests that the loss of body hair reduces the risk of infection by ectoparasites and that the movement toward nudity may have been enforced by parasite-mediated sexual selection. In this study, we investigated two possible predictions of this hypothesis: (1) that preferences for hairless bodies increase with exposure to environmental pathogens and (2) that disgust sensitivity to the pathogens' threat predicts the degree to which a woman will prefer hairless bodies. Using an experiment comparing the preferences of 88 women for shaved vs. hairy pictured versions of 20 male torsos, we found that exposure to the visual cues of pathogens does not predict preferences for a male chest nor does the individual disgust sensitivity to disease-related invertebrates. Overall, the results suggest that female perception of male trunk hair is not associated with a risk of contamination, which questions the salience of the ectoparasite avoidance hypothesis in explaining the loss of body hair in humans. © 2011 Springer-Verlag and ISPA.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that various disposition patterns in terms of the price changes are plausible under the Prospect Theory (PT), which argues that investors have a greater tendency to sell assets that have risen in value since the purchase than those that have fallen. Numerous empirical evidences have shown that investors demonstrate the disposition effect (DE). This study highlights that, when the disposition measure is defined by the stock price changes, the PT predicts the DE indeed. It also indicates other seemingly contradicting disposition patterns: the reversed disposition effect and the pattern of the symmetry over gains and losses. Design/methodology/approach: To show that the disposition effect is only one of the disposition patterns under the preference of PT, as part of this study the authors apply the mental account theory and propose two decision criteria for the gain and loss accounts, respectively, (i.e. maximum loss tolerated and minimum gain required). An empirical analysis was performed from a large-scale market survey in Taiwan to examine individual investors' disposition patterns. Findings: The findings show that more than 50 percent of individual investors demonstrate their disposition patterns other than the disposition effect. Many investors show the reversed disposition effect or the pattern of symmetry (holding about the same magnitude of gains or losses before realization). Originality/value: This study answers the questions which, to the authors' knowledge, have not been incorporated in the studies of the PT or the DE: first, when do investors sell losers which they are inclined to hold on to? Second, for how long do they hold winners which they are eager to sell? The authors' arguments allow various disposition patterns to exist simultaneously, without changing the value function in the PT of convexity over losses and concavity over gains and without requiring strict assumptions on the expected stock returns. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Near-miss outcomes during gambling are non-win outcomes that fall close to a pay-out. While objectively equivalent to an outright miss, near-misses motivate ongoing play and may therefore be implicated in the development of disordered gambling. Given naturalistic data showing increases in heart rate (HR) and electrodermal activity (EDA) during periods of real gambling play, we sought to explore the phasic impact of win, near-miss and full-miss outcomes on physiological arousal in a controlled laboratory environment. EDA and HR were monitored as healthy, student participants (n = 33) played a simulated slot-machine task involving unpredictable monetary wins. A second gambling distortion, perceived personal control, was manipulated within the same task by allowing the participant to select the play icon on some trials, and having the computer automatically select the play icon on other trials. Near-misses were rated as less pleasant than full-misses. However, on trials that involved personal choice, near-misses produced higher ratings of 'continue to play' than full-misses. Winning outcomes were associated with phasic EDA responses that did not vary with personal choice. Compared to full-misses, near-miss outcomes also elicited an EDA increase, which was greater on personal choice trials. Near-misses were also associated with greater HR acceleration than other outcomes. Near-miss outcomes are capable of eliciting phasic changes in physiological arousal consistent with a state of subjective excitement, despite their objective non-win status. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Worldwide, we rely on introduced plants for the essentials of human life; however, intentional plant introductions for commercial benefit have resulted in invaders with negative environmental, economic or social impacts. We argue that plant species of low expected economic value should be less acceptable for introduction than species of high economic value if their other traits are similar; however, key traits such as likelihood of escape and costs of escape are often highly uncertain. Methods do not currently exist which allow decision makers to evaluate costs and benefits of introduction under uncertainty. We developed a cost-benefit analysis for determining plant introduction that incorporates probability of escape, expected economic costs after escape, expected commercial benefits, and the efficiency and cost of containment. We used a model to obtain optimal decisions for the introduction and containment of commercial plants while maximizing net benefit or avoiding losses. We also obtained conditions for robust decisions which take into account severe uncertainty in model parameters using information-gap decision theory. Optimal decisions for introduction and containment of commercial plants depended, not only on the probability of escape and subsequent costs incurred, but also on the anticipated commercial benefit, and the cost and efficiency of containment. When our objective is to maximize net benefit, increasing uncertainty in parameter values increased the likelihood of introduction; in contrast, if our objective is to avoid losses, more uncertainty decreased the likelihood of introduction. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Prevention of (serious) overweight can be achieved by means of small behaviour changes in physical activity and/or diet. Objective: To evaluate a mass media campaign promoting energy balance behaviours in a Dutch population. Effects were examined for body mass index (BMI) and five energy balance behaviours. Methods: A representative cohort study of 1200 Dutch adults was employed. Data were collected at four moments. Two campaign waves were launched, following T1 (targeting the general adult population) and T2 [targeting low socio-economic status (SES) men], respectively. Regression analyses were performed to estimate the short-term and long-term effects of campaign exposure. Results: In total, data of 1030 participants (86%) were available. Time trends showed unfavourable changes in most but not all energy balances behaviour for the total sample. No differences were found for BMI. No differences in the outcome measures were found as a result of exposure to the first campaign (19%). A short-term effect of exposure to the second campaign (29% exposure) was found (T2-T3), but only for low SES respondents, with increases in the attention being paid towards food choice (P = 0.02). At long term, BMI was less likely to increase among exposed people with a non-Dutch ethnicity (P = 0.01, T2-T4). Conclusions: Exposure to the campaign was low. The first campaign wave had no effects on BMI and energy balance behaviours. Small but favourable changes in attention towards food choice and BMI for at-risk populations were observed among those exposed to the second campaign wave. © The Author 2012.

      "Abstract: It has been argued that rare economic disasters can explain most asset pricing puzzles. If this is the case, perceived risk associated with a disaster in stock markets should be revealed in household portfolios. That is, the framework that solves these pricing puzzles should also generate quantities that are consistent with the observed ones. This paper estimates the perceived risk of disasters (both probability and expected size) that is consistent with observed portfolios and consumption growth between 1983 and 2004 in the United States. I find that the portfolio choices of households that have less than a college degree can be partially explained by expectations of stock market disasters only if one allows for a large probability of labor income loss at the same time. Such disaster expectations, however, are not revealed in the portfolios of educated and wealthier households: simple per-period participation costs of the stock market coupled with preference heterogeneity explain their participation and investment patterns. © 2012 Sule Alan.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background The prevalence of diabetes is relatively high in people with intellectual disability (ID). However, little is known about how people with ID experience having diabetes and how they manage the condition. Method Seventeen people with mild to moderate ID who have diabetes were interviewed. A framework on illness perceptions having an influence on diabetes self-management was used as a basis for the interviews and for the qualitative analysis. Results Diabetes is associated with feelings of loss with regard to food intake and choices, and with being controlled. Most respondents did not feel ill. Information about diabetes for people with ID is lacking, but they do have questions. Family members with diabetes often serve as a role model. Diabetes self-management is impeded by a lack of information, motivation and support, few opportunities for learning, and by health factors, mood and living accommodation. Communication between health professionals and people with ID about diabetes rarely takes place. Conclusions Developing diabetes information together with the people concerned is an important step towards engagement in self-management activities. At the same time, the professional staff in living arrangements should stimulate and support the development of self-management skills in people with diabetes, by providing opportunities to learn and develop. Therefore, the professional staff also need skills and information to be able to support people with ID in building the skills and confidence they need to lead active and fulfilling lives, despite having diabetes. © 2011 The Authors.

      "Abstract: Bidding challenges learning theories. Even with the same bid, experiences vary stochastically: the same choice can result in either a gain or a loss. In such an environment, the question arises of how the nearly universally documented phenomenon of loss aversion affects the adaptive dynamics. We analyse the impact of loss aversion in a simple auction using the experienced-weighted attraction model of learning. Our experimental results suggest that individual learning dynamics are highly heterogeneous and affected by loss aversion to different degrees. Apart from that, the experiment shows that loss aversion is not specific to rare decision-making. © 2011 The London School of Economics and Political Science.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Individuals with schizophrenia often lack insight or awareness. Resulting impairment has been observed in various cognitive domains and, recently, linked to problems in emotion-based learning. The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been used to assess emotion-based decision-making in patients with schizophrenia, but results have been inconclusive. The current study further investigates emotion-based decision-making in schizophrenia by elucidating the unique contribution of awareness. Twenty-five patients with schizophrenia and 24 healthy controls were assessed with a modified version of the IGT recording awareness at regular intervals. Symptom assessment, medication and medical history were recorded for the clinical group. Patients with schizophrenia underperformed on the IGT compared to controls. Subjective awareness levels were significantly lower in the schizophrenia group and were associated with hallucination severity. Cognitive decision modelling further indicated that patients with schizophrenia had impaired attention to losses, compared to controls. This parameter was positively correlated with awareness. We also found that positive symptoms altered awareness levels and suggest that this disruption may contribute to sub-optimal decision-making. Overall, a lack of awareness may be an important aspect in understanding impaired social cognitive functioning and emotion-based learning observed in schizophrenia. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Observed levels of tax compliance are higher than predicted levels (when predictions are based on Allingham and Sandmo's neoclassical model of tax evasion). They are higher if social norms recognise the importance of compliance. But how do social norms frame decisions to pay tax? Can prospect theory be applied to shed insight into the way that social norms exert their influence? An analysis of questionnaire responses (from Italy and from the UK) suggests that they exert their influence by changing the reference points that individuals use when they code changes as 'gains', or 'losses'. The evidence suggests that social norms frame the decision to pay tax by changing individuals' perceptions of their entitlement to income. This consideration is important when designing policy to deter evasion. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Much research shows that people are loss averse, meaning that they weigh losses more heavily than gains. Drawing on an evolutionary perspective, we propose that although loss aversion might have been adaptive for solving challenges in the domain of self-protection, this may not be true for men in the domain of mating. Three experiments examine how loss aversion is influenced by mating and self-protection motives. Findings reveal that mating motives selectively erased loss aversion in men. In contrast, self-protective motives led both men and women to become more loss averse. Overall, loss aversion appears to be sensitive to evolutionarily important motives, suggesting that it may be a domain-specific bias operating according to an adaptive logic of recurring threats and opportunities in different evolutionary domains. © 2011 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study is the first to value the mortality risk incurred from wildlife reintroduction. We conducted choice experiments on wolf reintroduction in Hokkaido, Japan, in order to value the resulting mortality risk. This process involves three unique factors: the mortality risk is zero before the reintroduction, the increment of the risk caused by the reintroduction is substantially small, and the risk largely depends on citizens' individual characteristics concerning reintroduction. Because of these factors, the heterogeneity of risk preference is expected to be large. In order to examine these heterogeneous risk preferences, we use a random parameter logit model. The estimation results confirm that considerable heterogeneous risk preferences exist. Finally, the mean marginal willingness to pay to prevent the loss of one person per one billion people because of wolf reintroduction is several hundred yen. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: As intermodal hubs connecting barge, train, and truck transportation modes, inland ports play an important role in U.S. and global commerce. Like coastal ports, inland ports face the risk of malevolent attacks, man-made accidents, and natural disasters. However, most port impact studies focus on the consequences of one of these disruptive events suddenly closing a coastal port. This paper examines the economic impact of suddenly closing an inland port by combining a simulation and a multiregional input-output model. The simulation models how companies may react if an inland waterway port suddenly closes, and the multiregional dynamic inoperability input-output model quantifies the interdependent effects of these decisions. We deploy this simulation and model on a case study involving an Oklahoma port on the Arkansas River. The case study indicates that, if a financial penalty is imposed on companies for delivering their commodities late, companies will move their products by train rather than wait for the port to reopen. These decisions save billions of dollars in production losses for the states that use the port. We discuss the implications of these results for policymakers concerned about limiting the consequences of port closures. © 2011 IEEE.\u001b[0m :\n",

Using data for firms listed in the Athens Stock Exchange, we find that, on average, firms chose to take valuation gains to the income statement and losses through equity. Subsequently, a treatment effects model of returns on control variables, the valuation adjustment and a dummy for the accounting treatment, which is modeled as conditional to profitability, size, and risk was estimated. Results show that the valuation adjustment contains information for market prices while the market considers the decision to charge the valuation adjustment to equity to be a negative signal. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: The objective was to assess differences in adverse events between major depressive patients augmented with a second medication and patients switched to an alternative monotherapy after failing first-step treatment with citalopram. Method: Adverse event profiles for second-step switch and augment medication strategies were compared using public data files from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial. In the STAR*D trial, participants failing citalopram selected acceptable next-step strategies and were randomized within acceptable strategies. This design resulted in clinically important differences when comparing across strategies, so a propensity-score-matched sample was created to compare switch (n=269) and augment (n=269) strategies. Results: Incidence proportions of any adverse event and specific adverse events were similar between the augment and switch groups. The overall incidence proportion of any distressing event was 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72-0.84] in the augment group and 0.80 (95% CI 0.74-0.85) in the switch group. This contrasts unmatched analyses where distressing adverse events were less common in the augment group than the switch group (risk ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.90). Conclusion: After adjusting for selection bias inherent in the STAR*D comparison of augment with switch, clinically meaningful differences in the adverse event profiles between these treatment strategies were not observed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We model a dynamic purchase context in which a consumer is uncertain about the product's valuation. The consumer has two purchase opportunities for the product: forward purchase in Period 1 or spot purchase in Period 2. Two forms of regret are considered: buyer's regret over the money paid in excess of his valuation of the product when buying forward and hesitater's regret for the lost opportunity of an increased surplus when not buying forward. We illustrate how regrets affect the purchase decision: a consumer is more likely to buy forward when more averse to hesitater's regret but more likely to delay the decision when more averse to buyer's regret. We also consider alternative consumer types to characterize how regret affects their spot purchase decisions as well as what triggers the regret. We show that type inconsistency-that is, a consumer's incorrect anticipation of his future type-induces an inferior Period 1 purchase decision and thereby reduces the consumer's expected surplus. © 2012 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Many advertisers hire agencies to run their search engine marketing campaigns; increasingly, they use innovative performance-based compensation plans. In these plans, the advertiser pays the agency a fee for each conversion (i.e., acquired customer) but requires the agency to pay all of the search engine marketing costs. In this article, the authors address compensation decision problems for search engine marketing for the first time and conclude that such fee-based plans lower the advertiser's profit by as much as 26-30%. This article uses a simulation study and four empirical data sets to better understand what drives this profit loss. Two causes account for the loss: first, the agency spends less on advertising than is optimal for the advertiser. Second, the agency often earns more to manage the advertiser's campaign than its minimum requirement. This higher profit for the agency occurs because the advertiser pays the agency more in order to limit the agency's potential underspending on advertising. The authors show that this latter reason accounts for more than one-third of the advertiser's profit loss. This article also offers insights into how the advertiser's profit changes if the advertiser is uncertain about its profit per conversion or if the advertiser does not truthfully reveal its profit per conversion to the agency. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Death and rituals performed after death reflect and reproduce social distinctions despite death's popular reputation as a great leveler. This study examines expressions of religiosity and constructions of death in Turkish death announcements, paying particular attention to gendered, ethnic, and temporal variations as well as markers of status and cultural distinction. Death announcements in Turkey occupy a liminal position between obituaries and death notices: Unlike obituaries, no editorial decisions are involved in their publications. However, unlike death notices, Turkish announcements are venues for expressions of culturally scripted individual decisions. These large and decentralized collections of private decisions display rigid genre characteristics involving formulaic phrases but also change over time to reflect social, cultural, and economic changes in Turkish society. The present study focuses on a sample (N = 2,812) of death announcements in a major Turkish daily newspaper (Hürriyet) from 1970 to 2009. Results show that death announcements in Turkey increasingly rely on an emotional tone of loss and bereavement that replace constructions of death in a more detached and distant language and that religious and secular preferences in the language of announcements are an important domain in which cultural battles are fought and the participation patterns of new middle classes are negotiated. © Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Parents of children with incurable cancer face difficulties in making end-of-life decisions, and thus far, little research has been conducted on the thoughts and perceptions of these parents. Purpose: The study aims to describe parental thoughts and perceptions when they hear that their child has incurable cancer. Methods: Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 23 parents who had lost children to cancer. A constant comparative content analysis was also conducted. Results: Regarding parental thoughts, five categories emerged: \"not allowing my child to die,\" \"being compelled to continue cancer-directed/life-sustaining treatment,\" \"wanting to put an end to my child's suffering and wanting him/her to be comfortable,\" \"valuing my child's wish and dignity,\" and \"wanting to be there for my child.\" However, some parents did not mention all five categories. Regarding parental perceptions of their children's condition, six categories emerged: \"understanding change/deterioration of my child's condition,\" \"recognition of my child's sufferings,\" \"awareness of the possible death of my child,\" \"no recognition of my child's impending death as reality,\" \"avoiding facing my child's death,\" and \"realizing the truth and coming to terms with the reality of death.\" Conclusion: When parents were told that their child had incurable cancer, their first thought was to protect their child. Because thoughts and perceptions in such a situation vary across parents, health care professionals should support parents in realizing their thoughts and perceptions and in making decision as parents. © Copyright 2012, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The estimation of semi-compensatory models is gaining momentum in transport planning in recent years. However, traditional survey methodologies focus on collecting solely compensatory choice data, which leads to information loss when semi-compensatory models are estimated. The present study proposes a novel web-based survey that enables collecting data about the entire semi-compensatory choice process. The web-based environment allows seamless tracking of semi-compensatory choice protocols without interfering with the natural choice process and without introducing problems related to comprehension bias, narrative inconsistency and misinterpretation of the choice protocols. The procedure is applied to rental apartment choice by students and results shed light on semi-compensatory choice by: (1) demonstrating the importance of choice set formation; (2) unravelling the distribution of threshold selection across the population; (3) revealing the linkage between the viable choice-set and the choice. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Markowitz and Sharpe won the Nobel Prize in Economics for the development of Mean-Variance (M-V) analysis and the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Kahneman won the Nobel Prize in Economics for the development of Prospect Theory. In deriving the CAPM, Sharpe, Lintner and Mossin assume expected utility (EU) maximisation in the face of risk aversion. Kahneman and Tversky suggest Prospect Theory (PT) as an alternative paradigm to EU theory. They show that investors distort probabilities, make decisions based on change of wealth, exhibit loss aversion and maximise the expectation of an S-shaped value function, which contains a risk-seeking segment. Can these two apparently contradictory paradigms coexist? We show in this paper that although CPT (and PT) is in conflict to EUT, and violates some of the CAPM's underlying assumptions, the Security Market Line Theorem (SMLT) of the CAPM is intact in the CPT framework. Therefore, the CAPM is intact also in CPT framework. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Falling consent rates for postmortems, regardless of age of death, have been widely reported in recent years. The aim of this study was to explore parental attitudes to, and decision-making about, a perinatal postmortem after termination for fetal abnormality, late miscarriage, or stillbirth. Methods: A prospective self-completion questionnaire was given to 35 women and their partners. The participants had experienced second or third trimester pregnancy loss in a single fetal medicine and delivery unit in the United Kingdom and were making decisions about having a postmortem. They were asked to complete a questionnaire about their attitudes to, and expectations of, a perinatal postmortem. Results: Thirty-one questionnaires were received from parents of 17 babies (49% of those asked; 16 from mothers, 15 from fathers). Parents of nine babies (53%) said they would agree to a full postmortem, of three babies to a limited postmortem, and of four babies to an external examination only; one couple were undecided. The most important issues for the parents in this study that related to their decisions about a postmortem centered on the need for information, both for future planning and about what had happened. Moderately important issues related to altruism, which is, improving medical knowledge and helping other parents experiencing similar bereavement. Among the lowest scoring issues were potential barriers, such as concerns about cultural or religious acceptability of a postmortem, funeral delays, and what would happen to the baby's body. Conclusions: Bereaved parents who participated in this study, where postmortem consent rates were relatively high, thought that their need for knowledge eclipsed assumed barriers when deciding whether or not to have a postmortem for their baby. © 2012, Copyright the Authors.

      "Abstract: This paper investigates the time it takes unconscious vs. conscious knowledge to form by using an improved \" no-loss gambling\" method to measure awareness of knowing. Subjects could either bet on a transparently random process or on their grammaticality judgment in an artificial grammar learning task. A conflict in the literature is resolved concerning whether unconscious rather than conscious knowledge is especially fast or slow to form. When guessing (betting on a random process), accuracy was above chance and RTs were longer than when feeling confident (betting on the grammaticality decision). In a second experiment, short response deadlines only interfered with the quality of confident decisions (betting on grammaticality). When people are unaware of their knowledge, externally enforced decisions can be made rapidly with little decline in quality; but if given ample time, they await a metacognitive process to complete. The dissociation validates no-loss gambling as a measure of conscious awareness. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Over the past decade, the decision-making task of Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, and Anderson (1994), otherwise known as the Iowa Gambling Task (or IGT), has been employed in several hundred published studies. This task has helped to elucidate the nature of normal and abnormal decision making. However, the IGT has also proven time consuming to administer and difficult to employ in some clinical settings. The present study presents a novel measure that drastically reduces the time required for task administration: the Bangor Learning Intuitive and Nonverbal Kaleidoscope Task-BLINK-which employs immediate, nonverbal, visual feedback that allows participants to incorporate win/loss information within several hundred milliseconds. The present study demonstrates that BLINK is approximately 25 times faster than the IGT and also has a lower false-positive rate. In addition, we use expectancy-valence models to fit performance on our task, and we demonstrate that BLINK appears to depend on psychological mechanisms similar to those involved in IGT performance. We discuss several important theoretical and applied implications of the BLINK task. © 2012 Psychology Press, an imprint of the Taylor & Francis Group, an Informa business.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Three studies suggest that business cycle fluctuations trigger distinct motivational orientations that selectively affect economic judgment and decision making. Economic contractions induce avoidance motivation and affect negative economic sentiment, but leave approach motivation and positive economic sentiment unaffected. In contrast, economic expansions induce approach motivation and positive economic sentiment, but do not affect avoidance motivation or negative economic sentiment (study 1). Moreover, economic contractions induce risk aversion for negative outcomes, but not for positive outcomes, while economic expansions instigate risk seeking for positive outcomes, but not for negative outcomes (study 2). A time-series study based on consumer spending over eight decades mirrors the findings of the experimental studies: The consumption of products associated with avoiding negative outcomes increases during economic contractions, but not during expansions. In contrast, the consumption of products associated with achieving positive outcomes increases in expansions, but is unaffected by contractions (study 3). © 2011 Elsevier Inc..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Five experiments demonstrate that experiencing power leads to overconfident decision-making. Using multiple instantiations of power, including an episodic recall task (Experiments 1-3), a measure of work-related power (Experiment 4), and assignment to high- and low-power roles (Experiment 5), power produced overconfident decisions that generated monetary losses for the powerful. The current findings, through both mediation and moderation, also highlight the central role that the sense of power plays in producing these decision-making tendencies. First, sense of power, but not mood, mediated the link between power and overconfidence (Experiment 3). Second, the link between power and overconfidence was severed when access to power was not salient to the powerful (Experiment 4) and when the powerful were made to feel personally incompetent in their domain of power (Experiment 5). These findings indicate that only when objective power leads people to feel subjectively powerful does it produce overconfident decision-making. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Landslides are an increasing problem in Nepal's Middle Hills due to both natural and human phenomena: mainly increasingly intense monsoon rains and a boom in rural road construction. This problem has largely been neglected due to underreporting of losses and the dispersed nature of landslides. Understanding how populations cope with landslides is a first step toward developing more effective landslide risk management programs. The present research focuses on two villages in Central-Eastern Nepal, both affected by active landslides but with different coping strategies. Research methods are interdisciplinary, based on a geological assessment of landslide risk and a socio-economic study of the villages using household questionnaires, focus group discussions and transect walks. Community risk maps are compared with geological landslide risk maps to better understand and communicate community risk perceptions, priorities and coping strategies. A modified typology of coping strategies is presented, based on previous work by Burton, Kates, and White (1993) that is useful for decision-makers for designing more effective programs for landslide mitigation. Main findings underscore that coping strategies, mainly seeking external assistance and outmigration, are closely linked to access to resources, ethnicity/social status and levels of community organization. Conclusions include the importance of investing in organizational skills, while building on local knowledge about landslide mitigation for reducing landslide risk. There is great potential to increase coping strategies by incorporating skills training on landslide mitigation in existing agricultural outreach and community forest user group training. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Despite the central role of arbitrage in finance and economic theory, there is limited evidence of the factors that create and eliminate arbitrage opportunities, how often arbitrage occurs, and how profitable it is. We address these gaps via a transaction-level analysis of spatial arbitrage in the wholesale automotive market. We investigate why arbitrage opportunities are created by analyzing how sellers choose where to sell vehicles. We find that the attention sellers pay to the distribution of a vehicle is negatively related to the probability that it is arbitraged. Arbitrage occurs in approximately 1% of transactions, although electronic trading is making arbitrage less prevalent by improving buyer/seller matching across locations. Arbitrage yields a 5.6% return on average, although arbitrageurs take a loss 14% of the time. Our results contribute to the literature on arbitrage, the effect of attention allocation on market outcomes, and the effect of information technology on market efficiency. © 2012 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Advancement of myopic loss aversion theory has been hamstrung by conflicting results, methodological inconsistencies, and a piecemeal approach toward understanding the key factors influencing decision problem framing. A series of controlled experiments provides a more holistic view of the variables promoting myopia. Extending the information horizon promotes broad framing, which propels risk. Evaluation frequency and decision frequency interact regardless of information horizon, supporting the notion that restricting either mechanism alleviates myopia. When conducting evaluations infrequently, neither segregating nor aggregating retrospective returns significantly alters risk preferences. Moreover, students and real retirement plan participants exhibit comparable appetites for risk, implying that both groups frame decision problems similarly. Explanations for these findings and avenues for future research are discussed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc..\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Context: Negative symptoms are a core feature of schizophrenia, but their pathogenesis remains unclear. Negative symptoms are defined by the absence of normal function. However, there must be a productive mechanism that leads to this absence. Objective: To test a reinforcement learning account suggesting that negative symptoms result from a failure in the representation of the expected value of rewards coupled with preserved loss-avoidance learning. Design: Participants performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning paradigm involving stimulus pairs in which choices resulted in reward or in loss avoidance. Following training, participants indicated their valuation of the stimuli in a transfer test phase. Computational modeling was used to distinguish between alternative accounts of the data. Setting: A tertiary care research outpatient clinic. Patients: In total, 47 clinically stable patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 28 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Patients were divided into a high-negative symptom group and a low-negative symptom group. Main Outcome Measures: The number of choices leading to reward or loss avoidance, as well as performance in the transfer test phase. Quantitative fits from 3 different models were examined. Results: Patients in the high-negative symptom group demonstrated impaired learning from rewards but intact loss-avoidance learning and failed to distinguish rewarding stimuli from loss-avoiding stimuli in the transfer test phase. Model fits revealed that patients in the high-negative symptom group were better characterized by an \"actor-critic\" model, learning stimulus-response associations, whereas control subjects and patients in the lownegative symptom group incorporated expected value of their actions (\"Q learning\") into the selection process. Conclusions: Negative symptoms in schizophrenia are associated with a specific reinforcement learning abnormality: patients with high-negative symptoms do not represent the expected value of rewards when making decisions but learn to avoid punishments through the use of prediction errors. This computational framework offers the potential to understand negative symptoms at a mechanistic level. ©2012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We provide an economic interpretation of the practice consisting in incorporating risk measures as constraints in an expected prospect maximization problem. For what we call the infimum of expectations class of risk measures, we show that if the decision maker (DM) maximizes the expectation of a random prospect under constraint that the risk measure is bounded above, he then behaves as a \"generalized expected utility maximizer\" in the following sense. The DM exhibits ambiguity with respect to a family of utility functions defined on a larger set of decisions than the original one; he adopts pessimism and performs first a minimization of expected utility over this family, then performs a maximization over a new decisions set. This economic behaviour is called \"maxmin under risk\" and studied by Maccheroni (Econ Theory 19:823-831, 2002). As an application, we make the link between an expected prospect maximization problem, subject to conditional value-at-risk being less than a threshold value, and a non-expected utility economic formulation involving \"loss aversion\"-type utility functions. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2011.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objective: to increase our understanding of how pregnant women experience early ultrasound examination that includes a risk assessment for chromosomal anomalies and how such women perceive the test results. Design/setting: qualitative study at St. Olavs Hospital in Norway. Both pre- and post-examination interviews were conducted with ten pregnant women who underwent risk assessment for chromosomal anomalies. Grounded theory was used to analyse the results. Findings: the study generated a core category (I want a choice, but I don't want to decide), which related to the conflict between choice and decision making. There were also five main categories (existential choices, search for knowledge, anxiety, feeling of guilt and counselling and care). The main categories describe the complex feelings experienced by the women regarding the risk assessment. Factors contributing to the difficulty of choice included loss of control and coping, emotional connection to the fetus and social pressure. As the women sought independent choices without any external influence, they also felt greater responsibility. The women's understanding of the actual risk varied, and they used different types of logic and methods to evaluate the risk and reach a decision. Conclusions: the pregnant women in this study wanted prenatal diagnostic information and easy access to specialty services. Stress-related feelings and non-transparent information about the actual and perceived risks as well as personal moral judgments made the decision-making process complicated. Improved distribution of information and frequent contact with health professionals may help such women to make informed choices in accordance with their values and beliefs. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Self-serving biases in attribution, while found with relative consistency in research with Western samples, have rarely been found in Japanese samples typically recruited for research. However, research conducted with Japanese participants to date has tended to use forced-choice and/or reactive paradigms, with school or university students, focusing mainly on academic performance or arbitrary and/or researcher-selected tasks. This archival study explored whether self-serving attributional biases would be shown in the real-life attributions for sporting performance made by elite Olympic athletes from Japan and Australia. Attributions (N = 216) were extracted from the sports pages of Japanese and Australian newspapers and rated by Australian judges for locus and controllability. It was hypothesized that Australian, but not Japanese, athletes would show self-serving biases such that they attributed wins to causes more internal and controllable than the causes to which they attributed losses. Contrary to predictions, self-serving biases were shown to at least some extent by athletes of both nationalities. Both Australian and Japanese men attributed wins to causes more internal than those to which they attributed losses. Women, however, attributed wins and losses to causes that did not differ significantly in terms of locus. All athletes tended to attribute wins to causes that were more controllable than the causes to which losses were attributed. Results are inconsistent with a large body of research suggesting that Japanese do not show self-serving biases in attribution, and are discussed in the light of differences in methodology, context, and participants that may have contributed to these effects. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

To do so we experimentally investigate the simplest possible situation with both social comparison and risk: participants choose between two lotteries while a referent faces a fixed payoff. Participants are more risk averse when they can earn at most as much as their referent (loss situation) than when they are ensured they will earn at least as much as their referent (gain situation). Prospect theory with a social reference point would predict the exact opposite behavior.

      "Abstract: Background. BK virus nephropathy (BKVAN) causes about 10% of late kidney graft loss. Cidofovir is widely used to treat BKVAN, but the magnitude of the health benefits and costs are largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate the incremental health benefits and costs of cidofovir and immunosuppression reduction compared with immunosuppression reduction alone in kidney transplant patients with BKVAN. Methods. A probabilistic decision analytic model was developed to simulate a cohort of kidney transplant recipients aged 45 years and above with BKVAN who received cidofovir treatment compared with those who received standard care. The duration of the cycle was 1 year, and the model terminated when all recipients were deceased. Results. Compared with immunosuppression reduction alone, in the base-case, the incremental health benefits of cidofovir were 0.0061 life-years saved (2.2 days), with savings of $20,756 over the lifetime of a transplant recipient. When varying the most influential variables (the probability of response to treatment and graft loss) between best and worst case scenarios, the incremental health outcomes ranged from-0.967 to 1.093 life-years saved, with incremental costs ranging from an extra $27,313 to saving $20,756. Conclusions. Compared with immunosuppression reduction alone, based on best available data, cidofovir treatment and immunosuppression reduction for BKVAN seem to be cost saving and improves health outcomes. However, because of weak clinical data, particularly around comparative effectiveness, there is still moderate uncertainty in the incremental cost effectiveness. Adequately powered trials are still needed to better define optimal treatment strategies for BKVAN before cidofovir can be recommended strongly as routine therapy. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Preference reversals are frequently observed in the lab, but almost all designs use completely transparent prospects, which are rarely features of decision making elsewhere. This raises questions of external validity. We test the robustness of the phenomenon to gambles that incorporate realistic ambiguity in both payoffs and probabilities. In addition, we test a recent explanation of preference reversals by loss aversion, which would also restrict the incidence of reversals outside the lab. According to this account, reversals occur largely because the valuation task endows subject with a gamble, activating loss aversion. This contrasts with the choice task, where the reference point is pre-experiment wealth. We test this explanation by holding the reference point constant. Our evidence suggests that reversals are only slightly diminished with ambiguity. We find no evidence supporting their explanation by loss aversion. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Sensation seeking has been linked to increased risk taking and is therefore crucial in influencing behavioral outcomes of risk-taking behavior. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the neural underpinnings of risk appraisal were studied in a large subject sample (n = 188), stratified according to thrill and adventure seeking (TAS) ratings. As defined by a median split of the sample, low and high TAS groups were compared on a simple decision-making task completed during fMRI. The task was designed such that risk (i.e., magnitude of outcome) and gains (i.e., direction of outcome) could be mapped independently. Behavioral analysis indicated that high TAS individuals are more sensitive to rewards but less discriminating between risk with and without punishment and that low TAS individuals are less sensitive to rewards but quite sensitive to receiving punishments in risky situations. Imaging results on the group differences for the interaction between level of risk and level of gain showed differences in the right superior frontal gyrus (BA6), left insula (BA21), right nucleus accumbens, left lentiform nucleus, and left precuneus (BA7). The presented data suggest a neural model of risk processing in sensation seeking individuals such that the positive response to reward outweighs the impact of equivalent loss. This imbalance in approach/avoidance is evident in differences in the underlying neural substrates in TAS individuals and leads to greater risk behavior in the face of potential loss. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Results indicate that the elements of risk scenarios include time-space scenarios, disaster scenarios, and man-made scenarios. Ten-year and 100-year typhoon rainstorms and flood hazard areas are mainly concentrated in the coastal areas of Wenzhou City. The average rainfall across a 100-year frequency is 450 mm. The extreme water depth of a 100-year flood is 600 mm. High-vulnerability areas are located in Yueqing, Pingyang, Cangnan, and Wencheng counties. The average loss rate of a 100-year flood is more than 50%. The greatest possible loss of floods shows an obvious concentration-diffusion situation. There is an area of about 20-25% flood loss of 6-24 million Yuan RMB/km 2 in the Lucheng, Longwan and Ouhai districts. The average loss of a 100-year flood is 12 million Yuan RMB/km 2, and extreme loss reaches 49. 33 million Yuan RMB/km 2. The classification of risk scenario may be used for the choice of risk response priorities. For the next 50 years, the 10-year typhoon rainstorm-flood disaster is the biggest risk scenario faced by most regions of Wenzhou City. For the Yueqing, Ruian, and Ouhai districts, it is best to cope with a 100-year disaster risk scenario and the accompanying losses. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Open-cut coal mining projects can have a range of environmental, cultural and social impacts that, in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, are required to be addressed as part of the environmental assessment (EA) process. While these impacts are often addressed within separate impact assessment frameworks, it is possible to undertake EA as an applied economic analysis with non-market valuation methods such as choice modelling (CM) used to incorporate environmental, cultural and social impacts. A CM study of the proposed extension of the Warkworth Mine in the Hunter Valley of NSW found that community well-being declined with increased clearing of endangered ecological communities (EECs), loss of highly significant Aboriginal sites and displacement of rural families from affected villages, but increased with the length of time that the mine provides employment and with the planting or protection of EECs as offsets. Community preferences for these offsets ranged from a ratio of 1.4:1 for protection of existing remnant EECs in the region to a ratio of 4.0:1 for planting of EECs. © 2012, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Contrary to the usual assumption of fixed, well-defined and context independent preferences, individuals are likely to approach a choice task using rules and heuristics that are dependent on the choice environment. More specifically, heuristics that are defined by the local choice context, such as the gains or losses of an attribute value relative to the other attributes, seem to matter significantly. Recent empirical findings also demonstrate that previous choices made by respondents and previous choice tasks shown to respondents can affect the current choice outcome, indicating a form of interdependence across choice sets. This paper reviews some of the key findings about heuristics and decision rules across the psychology, marketing, transport and environmental disciplines. Using experimental data in the context of a proposed toll road, we find that for certain components of the time and cost attributes, allowing for non-linearity and for referencing to the least desired attribute level in the local choice set offers improvement over the standard linear-in-the-attributes and linear-in-the-parameters specification. Other heuristics, including the majority of confirming dimensions and reference point revision can also be embedded into the model. An alternative approach to identifying and weighting multiple heuristics in a utility function by means of a logit-type specification for the weights is then introduced. While acknowledging the need for more work in this area, we suggest that such an approach may be a useful way of testing what happens when multiple heuristics are \"mixed\" in the model. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

      "Abstract: We investigated the contribution of cognitive ability and affect to age differences in sequential decision making by asking younger and older adults to shop for items in a computerized sequential decision-making task. Older adults performed poorly compared to younger adults partly due to searching too few options. An analysis of the decision process with a formal model suggested that older adults set lower thresholds for accepting an option than younger participants. Further analyses suggested that positive affect, but not fluid abilities, was related to search in the sequential decision task. A second study that manipulated affect in younger adults supported the causal role of affect: Increased positive affect lowered the initial threshold for accepting an attractive option. In sum, our results suggest that positive affect is a key factor determining search in sequential decision making. Consequently, increased positive affect in older age may contribute to poorer sequential decisions by leading to insufficient search. © 2012 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: This study aims to gather descriptions from multiethnic Asian breast cancer patients on their experiences and impact of chemotherapy-associated cognitive changes on their daily lives and their coping strategies. Patients and methods: Forty-three chemotherapy-receiving breast cancer patients participated in eight English or Chinese structured focus group discussions, conducted by trained psychosocial oncologists and medical social workers. Results: Participants were unfamiliar and averse to both English and Chinese-translated equivalent of the term 'chemobrain'. Participants viewed this phenomenon holistically as a by-product of the physical (fatigue and aging) and psychosocial (anxiety and mood changes) adverse effects associated with chemotherapy. Most participants encountered memory loss, difficulty in decision making and speech problems after receiving chemotherapy. Married participants expressed frustration as cognitive deterioration limited their conservative roles as homemakers. Despite knowing the potential neurocognitive effects, participants valued the benefits of chemotherapy. Identified coping strategies included playing mahjong for mind stimulation and management of psychosocial factors, such as practicing qi gong, to regulate their moods and to take complementary alternative medicines to reduce the severity of their fatigue. Conclusions: The phenomenon 'chemobrain' is unfamiliar to most Asian cancer patients yet it has significantly impacted their daily lives. Our results suggested that a culturally relevant approach should be adopted to evaluate and manage cognitive changes in these patients. © The Author 2012.

      "Abstract: Young women who carry BRCA1/2 mutations face difficult decisions in managing their hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk. Through this National Cancer Institute study, we sought to understand the process by which some young women choose risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (RRBM) instead of alternative risk-management options. Data indicate that electing to undergo RRBM, although difficult, is experienced as a way to sidestep potentially devastating outcomes, such as stressful and costly high-risk screening, chemotherapy or radiation, or putting loved ones through the challenges of a cancer diagnosis. The decision to pursue RRBM is often the product of screening fatigue, encouragement from loved ones, and/or a sense of urgency to put one’s high-risk period behind one. By understanding how young carriers make decisions about surgical risk reduction, providers can better guide, counsel, and support patients in the important tasks surrounding this life-changing medical decision, thereby helping to increase the duration and quality of their lives. © 2012, SAGE Publications.

METHODS Three general practitioners sent questionnaires to all registered patients aged 50 to 70 years. Patients agreeing to participate in the study were asked to estimate the number of events (fractures or deaths) prevented in a group of 5,000 patients undergoing each intervention over a period of 10 years, and to indicate the minimum number of events avoided by the intervention that they considered justified its use. The proportions of participants that overestimated each intervention's benefit were calculated, and univariate and multivariable analyses of predictors of response were performed. RESULTS The participation rate was 36%: 977 patients were invited to participate in the study, and 354 returned a completed questionnaire. Participants overestimated the degree of benefit conferred by all interventions: 90% of participants overestimated the effect of breast cancer screening, 94% overestimated the effect of bowel cancer screening, 82% overestimated the effect of hip fracture preventive medication, and 69% overestimated the effect of preventive medication for cardiovascular disease. Estimates of minimum acceptable benefit were more conservative, but other than for cardiovascular disease mortality prevention, most respondents indicated a minimum benefit greater than these interventions achieve. A lower level of education was associated with higher estimates of minimum acceptable benefit for all interventions. CONCLUSION Patients overestimated the risk reduction achieved with 4 examples of screening and preventive medications. A lower level of education was associated with higher minimum benefit to justify intervention use. This tendency to overestimate benefits may affect patients' decisions to use such interventions, and practitioners should be aware of this tendency when discussing these interventions with patients.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In this study, we investigated the experience of children who died of cancer, as perceived by their parents. All the pediatric oncology departments in one German federal state were contacted and asked to invite parents who had lost a child to cancer in the period 2005-2006 to participate. Those parents who accepted were interviewed by means of a semi-structured questionnaire. In the participating 16 departments, 158 children died in 2005-2006. Parents of 48 children (38.3 percent) agreed to participate and were interviewed. Nearly all of the children had suffered from at least one distressing symptom. Pain and fatigue occurred most frequently. Symptoms were successfully treated over 65 percent of the time. In all, 64 percent of the children received home care services; 50 percent died at home, and only 10 percent in the ICU. Results suggest that some progress has been made in pediatric palliative care. To further improve end-of-life care for children with cancer, it is also necessary to evaluate parents' perspectives on structures for pediatric palliative care delivery. © 2012 Institut universitaire de géroatrie de gériatrie de Montréal.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Abortion is a serious public health problem that involves legal, economic, social and psychological issues. This qualitative study aimed to identify situations that interfere in the abortion decision and the feelings about the process of aborting. The study was conducted in a public maternity hospital in the city of Salvador (Northeastern Brazil), and the subjects were nine women hospitalized due to induced abortion. To collect data, we used the interview accompanied by a semi-structured form. Ethical aspects were considered based on Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council. For the analysis of the discourses, we used Bardin's content analysis technique. The sample was characterized by predominantly black adult women, married or in a stable union, financially dependent on the partner. In the analysis, two themes emerged: motivation and feelings. Among the reasons leading to abortion, there are financial difficulties, the number of children, the experience of domestic violence and the loss of their autonomy. The process of aborting generates fear of death, sadness and relief. Women experiencing induced abortion revealed a very painful process from the moment they discover the pregnancy until the difficult decision to interrupt it. When they are not helped, these women perpetuate the pain, living days of anguish and guilt. The exercise of listening and welcoming these women must be present in the lives of health professionals, regardless of their views on abortion, so that the women can express their feelings, and then get appropriate help and referral.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The credit crisis in 2007/2008 has increased the focus on bank credit risk. This paper uses an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate the impact of bankers post-credit decision actions on bank credit losses that are induced by lending to corporate clients. The banker agents are modelled according to results obtained from a survey that was distributed to bankers who are permitted to grant credit to firms. The results show that post-credit decision actions have substantial effects on bank credit losses, thus implying that regulators should consider organizational factors as a complement to bank assets when assigning capital requirements to banks. The study also aims to point to a new area of application of ABMs for both researchers and practitioners. Whereas previous research has used ABMs to simulate financial markets, this study suggests that financial organizations could be a vital area of application. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A leading hypothesis to explain the social dysfunction in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is that they exhibit a deficit in reward processing and motivation specific to social stimuli. However, there have been few direct tests of this hypothesis to date. Here we used an instrumental reward learning task that contrasted learning with social rewards (pictures of positive and negative faces) against learning with monetary reward (winning and losing money). The two tasks were structurally identical except for the type of reward, permitting direct comparisons.We tested 10 high-functioning people with ASD (7M, 3F) and 10 healthy controls who were matched on gender, age, and education. We found no significant differences between the two groups in terms of overall ability behaviorally to discriminate positive from negative slot machines, reaction-times, and valence ratings, However, there was a specific impairment in the ASD group in learning to choose social rewards, compared to monetary rewards: they had a significantly lower cumulative number of choices of the most rewarding social slot machine, and had a significantly slower initial learning rate for the socially rewarding slot machine, compared to the controls. The findings show a deficit in reward learning in ASD that is greater for social rewards than for monetary rewards, and support the hypothesis of a disproportionate impairment in social reward processing in ASD. © 2012 Lin, Rangel and Adolphs.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The use of technology in sport to assist umpires has been gradually introduced into several sports. This has now been extended to allow players to call upon technology to arbitrate when they disagree with the umpire's decision. Both tennis and cricket now allow the players to challenge a doubtful decision, which is reversed if the evidence shows it to be incorrect. However, the number of challenges is limited, and players must balance any possible immediate gain with the loss of a future right to challenge. With similar challenge rules expected to be introduced in other sports, this situation has been a motivation to consider challenges more widely. We use Dynamic Programming to investigate the optimal challenge strategy and obtain some general rules. In a traditional set of tennis, players should be more aggressive in challenging in the latter stages of the games and sets, and when their opponent is ahead. Optimal challenge strategy can increase a player's chance of winning an otherwise even five-set match to 59%. © 2012 Operational Research Society Ltd. All rights reserved.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In order to be treated quantitatively, subjective gains and losses (utilities/disutilities) must be psychologically measured. If legitimate comparisons are sought between them, measurement must be at least interval level, with a common unit. If comparisons of absolute magnitudes across gains and losses are further sought, as in standard definitions of loss aversion, a common known zero must be added to the common unit requirement. These measurement issues are typically glossed over in complex models of decision under risk. This paper illustrates how Functional Measurement (FM) affords ways of addressing them, given some conditions. It establishes a relative ratio model for the integration of gains and losses in a mixed gamble situation with independent outcome probabilities. It subsequently documents how this model yields functional estimates of gains and losses on a common unit scale with a known zero. The psychological significance of the found integration model is discussed, and some of its implications for measurement further explored across two studies.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In contrast with expected utility theory, empirical findings indicate that decision-makers are sensitive to departures from reference points rather than states. Several tests of the reference-dependent preference framework have been carried out in experimental economics, and to a smaller extent in a choice modelling setting, to date. However, these empirical applications have generally focussed on a single behavioural phenomenon using uniform modelling approaches. This paper aims to broaden existing work by presenting a multi-attribute framework, allowing contemporarily for gains-losses asymmetry, non-linearity and testing for several possible reference points. The framework is applied in the context of commuter choices and reveals important gains in model fit and further insights into behaviour compared to standard modelling approaches. Of particular relevance for future research is the functional form of fare sensitivity that varies significantly with the reference point used. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) can have intelligence within the normal range, but nevertheless have deficiencies in decision-making and complex novel problem-solving. The specific nature of these problems is not yet clearly understood. The Iowa Gambling Task was used to test decision-making ability and problem-solving in 40 individuals with complete or partial ACC (full-scale intelligence quotient >80) and 26 control participants. The expectancy-valence (EV) model was applied to the trial-by-trial responses of each participant to elucidate differences in decision processes utilized by each group. The ACC group had a lower overall net gain and fewer advantageous choices than controls, but these differences were not statistically significant. Within the EV model, individuals with ACC exhibited significantly higher attention to losses, less consistency in their choice strategy, and greater frequency of switching between decks. They also showed a tendency to be more influenced by recent trials. This outcome is similar to that seen in individuals with Asperger's disorder. Taken together, these results suggest that individuals with ACC have difficulty in inferring game contingencies and forming a coherent selection strategy, implicating the corpus callosum in these decision processes. © The Author 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

This study identifies the factors that obese children who have tried to lose weight perceive as affecting their efforts. This descriptive qualitative study has sought to identify factors affecting obese children's weight-loss decision making and process and to explore the development of an effective weight-loss program. This study screened 603 primary school children equivalent to U.S. Grades 5 and 6 of age 10-12. Seventy-nine out of 93 obese children who had been trying on their own to lose weight for at least 1 month formed 6 focus groups. Four themes were identified: Making the decision, self-efficacy, social influences, and environmental constraints. The results suggest that the design of a weight-loss program for obese children should include the contribution of family members, school, and health professionals. © The Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Studying group decision-making is challenging for multiple reasons. An important logistic difficulty is studying a sufficiently large number of groups, each with multiple participants. Assembling groups online could make this process easier and also provide access to group members more representative of real-world work groups than the sample of college students that typically comprise lab Face-to-Face (FtF) groups. The main goal of this paper is to compare the decisions of online groups to those of FtF groups. We did so in a study that manipulated gain/loss framing of a risky decision between groups and examined the decisions of both individual group members and groups. All of these dependent measures are compared for an online and an FtF sample. Our results suggest that web-conferencing can be a substitute for FtF interaction in group decision-making research, as we found no moderation effects of communication medium on individual or group decision outcome variables. The effects of medium that were found suggest that the use of online groups may be the preferred method for group research. To wit, discussions among the online groups were shorter, but generated a greater number of thought units, i.e., they made more efficient use of time.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine whether individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) differ from cognitively normal (NC) elders on a risk assessment task and whether participants and their study partners evaluate risk and benefit similarly. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: University medical setting. PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-nine participants (NC, n = 40; MCI, n = 39), age 60-90 years (73 ± 7 years; 53% women), and 64 study partners (NC, n = 36; MCI, n = 28), age 38-84 years (68 ± 10 years; 67% women). MEASUREMENTS: Participants and study partners completed a risk assessment task that involved ranking from least to most risk four hypothetical vignettes for memory loss research (brain autopsy, blood draw, oral medication, neurosurgery). Participants also completed decisional capacity for research and neuropsychological protocols. RESULTS: MCI participants' risk rankings differed from NC risk rankings (p <0.001) with MCI participants ranking brain autopsy higher and an oral medication trial lower. Demographic, decisional capacity, and neuropsychological variables could not explain MCI participant performances. Participants and their study partners had comparable risk assessment performance (p = 1.0). MCI study partners performed similar to their MCI participant counterparts but were different from NC study partners (p = 0.002; i.e., ranking autopsy higher and oral medication lower). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that individuals with MCI assess risk differently than NC peers by overestimating the risk (or underestimating the benefit) of brain autopsy and underestimating the risk (or overestimating the benefit) of oral medication. Study partners display a similar pattern. These observations may be secondary to MCI participants' (and their study partners') personal connection to the potential benefits of an experimental medication for memory loss. © 2012 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of this article is to look into heterogeneity in loss aversion in order to detect how dispersed loss aversion is in tourism and to observe whether different degrees of loss aversion can lead to the identification of loss-aversion-based segments. Loss aversion is a prominent psychological human trait that causes asymmetric price reactions. Tourism literature has shown it is a critical characteristic with a significant, but heterogeneous, effect on tourist destination choice. However, so far no attempt has been made to look into loss aversion heterogeneity, and this article contributes to the literature by exploring, for the first time, the potential existence of groups of tourists that show differentiated asymmetric responses to price. The empirical application estimates the individual degree of loss aversion for each tourist, and detects five segments with different sensitivities. Relevant managerial implications are drawn in terms of implementing pricing strategies. © 2012 SAGE Publications.\u001b[0m :\n",

Building upon research looking at stress effects on decision making, a gambling task was administered to 65 healthy adults, comparing decision making on trials on which a red screen background signalled threat of shocks against trials when shocks could not occur. The threat cues elicited increased electrodermal activity and a sustained decrease in heart rate, consistent with defensive vigilance. The threat condition was associated with risk-avoidant choices, on trials where the risky option involved moderate losses and when choosing between options involving only losses. These effects were not explained by changes in latency. Threat exerts immediate effects on decision making and physiological arousal, biasing subjects towards safer alternatives, potentially through a magnified processing of loss information. © 2012 Society for Psychophysiological Research.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Wetlands are unique habitats formed in the interactions between water and land. As one of the most productive ecological systems with richest biodiversity, it plays an irreplaceable role in the maintenance of ecological safety. Since the 1970s, wetland loss and degradation have sparked a series of environmental problems on a global scale which have become a major threat to national or global sustainable development. Especially, rapid economic development combined with the lacks of wetland protection in China have lead to serious imbalance between wetland protection and economic development. As a result of the above problems, decreased natural wetland and degradation of wetland function seem out of control. Now, wetland ecological compensation became more and more important because it is a choice for sustainable utilization of wetland resources. As an economic and policy means widely applied in developed countries, ecological compensation has been effectively used in the adjustment of natural resources conservation and resource utilization. Wetland ecological compensation study has always been a hot but difficult research spot. As an important ecological barrier in the western China, Crested ibis national Nature Reserve plays an important role in protection Crested ibis as well as its habitats. However, wetlands in Qinling Nature Reserve are typical ecological and environmental vulnerable zones. Excessive development and resource utilization makes the vulnerability of ecology and environment of this region increasing. It is necessary to take effective measures to develop a reasonable ecological compensation mechanism and policies for the coordination of ecological and economic development. As a basic unit in the implementation of ecological compensation, local farmers are key actors to give impetus to the ecological compensation. Understanding their willingness in cooperation and compensation is particularly important for improving farmers' ecological compensation enthusiasm formulation and implementation of ecological compensation policies. Taking Crested ibis Nature Reserve in Shanxi Province as an example, this study applied Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to measure ecological compensation amounts of rice loss of local farmers in 2008 and 2011. Firsthand information was collected through structured interview and questionnaire survey. Results indicate that the compensation amounts are respectively, 3560.56 yuan/ hm2 and 3679.83 yuan/hm2. Logistic regression model analysis results show that the most important factor that affects farmers' willings of the ecological compensation is the ratio between paddy field and the total area of arable land. Besides, family annual average income the presence of non-agricultural income, the distance from Crested ibis reserve and decrease amount of rice production because of Crested ibis protection. The results also indicate that the government should dominate the ecological compensation and develop long-term mechanism for ecological management. It is necessary to note that the current eco-compensation mechanism needs further improve. Additional actions are needed to maintain basic living standards of local farmers, such as investments into the processing industry and job training programs. This study provides principle guidelines for implementing eco-compensation across Crested ibis Nature Reserve as well as others. This study can be served as a start case for promoting wetland ecological compensation mechanism, especially for Shaanxi Crested ibis Nature Reserve.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper provides a simple two-depositor, two-stage model to understand how a bank's withdrawal history affects an individual's decision about withdrawals, which could possibly trigger bank runs. Individual depositors have private information about their personal consumption types and receive noisy private signals about the quality of the bank's portfolio. Depositors make publicly observable withdrawal decisions in sequence. Computed examples indicate that the optimal contract contingent on withdrawal histories can tolerate bank runs. These runs are triggered by unfavorable signals about a bank's portfolio, and early liquidation of unsuccessful investments can avoid future losses. Because the signals are private, a depositor's action is the only way to partially reveal his private information. A run admitting bank contract allows information to be revealed. However, if signals are too noisy, bank runs may occur too often when fundamentals are strong. In this case, a bank would offer a run-proof contract. Given the relevant role of information, a policy that makes private information public would be useful to improve welfare and eliminate bank runs. © 2012, The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When decision-makers are faced with a choice among multiple options that have several attributes, preferences are often influenced by how the options are related to one another. For example, consumer preferences can be influenced, and even reversed, by the context defined by available products. This article discusses three standard context effects found in the preferential-choice literature: the attraction, similarity, and compromise effects. While decision theorists have attempted to explain these three effects under single modeling accounts, it has never before been demonstrated that these effects can be obtained within the same experimental paradigm. A set of experiments is described that demonstrate the three effects in an inference task. The paradigm is completely novel, as no previous experimental work has examined the standard context effects in inference. The experiments also add to evidence that the effects are not confined to choices among options with affective value, such as consumer products. The experimental results provide evidence that these effects might be a general property of human choice behavior and bring into question explanations of the effects that are based on the concept of loss-aversion asymmetry. © 2012 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

Adverse selection is one of the consequences of asymmetric information. Theory of adverse selection states that high-risk individuals demand the insurance service more than low risk individuals do. Methods: The presence of adverse selection in Iran's supplementary health insurance market is tested in this paper. The study group consists of 420 practitioner individuals aged 20 to 59. We estimate two logistic regression models in order to determine the effect of individual's characteristics on decision to purchase health insurance coverage and loss occurrence. Using the correlation between claim occurrence and decision to purchase health insurance, the adverse selection problem in Iranian supplementary health insurance market is examined. Results: Individuals with higher level of education and income level purchase less supplementary health insurance and make fewer claims than others make and there is positive correlation between claim occurrence and decision to purchase supplementary health insurance.

The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a widely used tool to evaluate decision making, but little is known about the effect of age on its results. This study used the IGT and compared healthy young (n= 40) and elderly (n = 40) adults to evaluate their decision making processes. There were significant differences in the learning curve of the two age groups, but no difference in overall IGT performance. The results for the first IGT block were different from those of the rest of the task, and the group of elderly adults had a better performance in this block. Elderly adults also showed a preference for deck A, the one that resulted in greater losses. Findings confirmed the results of other studies, which reported that the IGT block score is the variable with the greatest sensitivity to age in this instrument. © 2012 by The Spanish Journal of Psychology.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The concept of metacontingency was taught to undergraduate students of Psychology by using a \"game\" simulation proposed originally by Vichi, Andery and Glenn (2009). Twenty-five students, distributed into three groups were exposed to six experimental sessions in which they had to make bets and divide the amounts gained. The three groups competed against each other for photocopies quotas. Two contingencies shifted over the sessions. Under Contingency B, the group would win points only if in the previous round each member had received the same amount of points and under Contingency A, winning was contingent on an unequal distribution of the points. We observed that proportional divisions predominated independent of the contingency in course. The manipulation of cultural consequences (winning or losing points) produced consistent modifications in two response categories: 1) choices of the value bet in each round, and 2) divisions of the points among group members. Controlling relations between cultural consequences and the behavior of dividing were statistically significant in one of the groups, whereas in the other two groups controlling relations were observed only in Contingency B.

      "Abstract: The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) has been widely used to assess differences in decision-making under uncertainty. Recently, several studies have shown that healthy subjects do not meet the basic predictions of the task (i.e., prefer options with positive long-term outcome), hence questioning its basic assumptions. Since choice options are characterized by gain and net loss frequency in addition to long-term outcome, we hypothesized that a combination of features rather than a single feature would influence participants' choices. Offering an alternative way of modeling IGT data, we propose to use a system of linear equations to estimate weights that quantify the influence of each individual feature on decision-making in the IGT With our proposed model it is possible to disentangle and quantify the impact of each of these features. Results from 119 healthy young subjects suggest that choice behavior is predominantly influenced by gain and loss frequency. Subjects preferred choices associated with high-frequency gains to those with low-frequency gains, regardless of long-term outcome. However, among options with low-frequency gains, subjects learned to distinguish between choices that led to advantageous and disadvantageous long-term consequences. This is reflected in the relationship between the weights for gain frequency (highest), loss frequency (intermediate), and long-term outcome (lowest). Further, cluster analysis of estimated feature weights revealed sub-groups of participants with distinct weight patterns and associated advantageous decision behavior. However, subjects in general do not learn to solely base their preference for particular decks on expected long-term outcome. Consequently, long-term outcome alone is notable to drive choice behavior on the IGT In sum, our model facilitates a more focused conclusion about the factors guiding decision-making in the IGT In addition, differences between clinical groups can be assessed for each factor individually. © 2012 Horstmann, Villringer and Neumann.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Would you make the same decisions in a foreign language as you would in your native tongue? It may be intuitive that people would make the same choices regardless of the language they are using, or that the difficulty of using a foreign language would make decisions less systematic. We discovered, however, that the opposite is true: Using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. Four experiments show that the framing effect disappears when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. Whereas people were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses when choices were presented in their native tongue, they were not influenced by this framing manipulation in a foreign language. Two additional experiments show that using a foreign language reduces loss aversion, increasing the acceptance of both hypothetical and real bets with positive expected value. We propose that these effects arise because a foreign language provides greater cognitive and emotional distance than a native tongue does. © The Author(s) 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a nocturnal respiratory disorder associated with cognitive and behavioral sequelae, including impairments in executive functioning (EF). Previous literature has focused on \"cool\" EF, meaning abilities such as working memory and planning that do not involve affective control requirements. Little is known about the impact OSA may have on \"hot\" EF that involves regulation of affect and risk-related decision-making, and that may be particularly salient during adolescence, when these skills are rapidly developing. This study examined performance on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a task believed to assess aspects of \"hot\" EF, in overweight adolescents at risk for OSA. Consistent with hypotheses, individuals without OSA made more beneficial decisions on the IGT over time, but participants with OSA did not benefit from feedback and continued to make choices associated with higher initial rewards, but greater long-term losses. The relationship between developmental level and IGT performance was moderated by OSA status. Individuals with OSA did not demonstrate the expected developmental gains in performance during the IGT. This finding suggests that OSA may impact the development of critical aspects of EF, or at least the expression of these skills during the developmentally important period of adolescence. © Copyright The International Neuropsychological Society 2012.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Advantageous decision making progressively develops into early adulthood, most specifically in complex and motivationally salient decision situations in which direct feedback on gains and losses is provided (Figner & Weber, 2011). However, the factors that underlie this developmental improvement in decision making are still not well understood. The current study therefore investigates 2 potential factors, long-term memory and working memory, by assigning a large developmental sample (7-29 years of age) to a condition with either high or low demands on long-term and working memory. The first condition featured an age-adapted version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara, Damasio, Damasio, & Anderson, 1994; i.e., a noninformed situation), whereas the second condition provided an external store where explicit information on gains, losses, and probabilities per choice option was presented (i.e., an informed situation). Consistent with previous developmental IGT studies, children up to age 12 did not learn to prefer advantageous options in the noninformed condition. In contrast, all age groups learned to prefer the advantageous options in the informed conditions, although a slight developmental increase in advantageous decision making remained. These results indicate that lowering dependence on long-term and working memory improves children's advantageous decision making. The results additionally suggest that other factors, like inhibitory control processes, may play an additional role in the development of advantageous decision making. © 2011 American Psychological Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We examine the value of board diversity in the US banking industry as a mechanism to enhance the decision-making capabilities of a board. We employ a sample of mergers to assess if measures of diversity as displayed by the bidding bank's board are linked to the market performance of acquisitions. We find positive announcement returns to mergers approved by boards whose members are diverse in terms of their occupational background. By contrast, age and tenure diversity are associated with wealth losses surrounding acquisition announcements, while gender diversity does not lead to measurable value effects. Interestingly, boards with more banking expertise are not more effective at monitoring bank managers. Our results do not support calls for more representation of industry-specific expertise on bank boards and, instead, show that occupational diversity may play an important role in protecting shareholder wealth. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Despite its association with a number of side effects, hair dye use is common worldwide. Objective: To explore the local side effects of hair dye use and to relate these effects to features of hair dyeing. Methods: A questionnaire about hair dye use was distributed to a random sample of 650 female patients at various outpatient clinics in 2008. Results: A total of 567 females returned the questionnaire (87.2% response rate). Of these respondents, 82.6% (464 of 562) had used hair dye products in the past. The mean age at first use was 22.23 ± 7.05 years, and the median time between two consecutive dyes was 6 months. Of these respondents, 76.8% (354 of 461) used permanent dyes. Participants reported that they suffered skin redness caused by hair dyes (15.1%, 65 of 431), had scaling (14.4%, 60 of 417), or had itchiness (31.3%, 134 of 428). In addition, 74% (262 of 354) of the participants reported that they had issues with the texture or condition of hair following hair dye use; 77.7% (314 of 404) reported split ends, whereas 69.6% (273 of 392) reported hair dryness, 69.4% (256 of 369) lusterless hair, 77.2% (308 of 399) excessive hair loss, and 53.6% (210 of 392) excessive hair graying. Furthermore, 55.1% (196 of 356) of the participants reported a slowing of hair growth. The total number of hair dyeing events was associated with increased hair loss (p 5 .04) and excessive graying (p < .001) after controlling for all relevant variables. Conclusion: Hair dye is associated with local side effects to the skin and hair. Increased public awareness of these risks could help inform consumer choices and reduce excessive use. © 2012 Canadian Dermatology Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The aim of this paper was to present an effective approach for risk assessment of uncertainty system. In general, risk assessment is a complex uncertainty decision-making (MUDM) problem; therefore, a complex assessment process is often involved in which aleatory, epistemic and empirical. The paper establishes the methodology, theory and empirical analysis based on the non-optimum analysis of the risk system. The formation of nonoptimum system serves as the basis for existence of risk system. Besides, the various factors of the risk system can be measured from the non-optimum information system (NOIS). At the same time, it provides the relationship of the non-optimum and losses, non-optimum and risk. Based on non-optimum analysis, this paper also sets up the probability relationship between non-optimum and losses, as well as non-optimum and risk, and discusses the guide function of non-optimum information system to risk assessment. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.

      "Abstract: In a competitive market, customer decision is made to maximize his utility. It can be assumed that risk of losing a supply chain's customer can be defined based on products utility from customer point of view. This paper takes account of product's price and service level as competition criteria. The proposed model is based on non-cooperative game theory, for one-manufacturer and one-retailer supply chain facing an outside integrated-competitor. The aim of the paper is to investigate the trade-offs of responsiveness and efficiency in a supply chain. Therefore, we consider product utility from the customer point of view as an objective, along with traditional profit objective function. Three scenarios are proposed in the paper: competition based on profit gained, competition based on responsiveness to customer needs, and finally, competition based on the profit gained and responsiveness to customer needs, concurrently. Numerical examples are presented including sensitivity analysis of key parameters. We illustrate that the relative importance that player considers for profit compared to the risk of losing customer plays a critical role in supply chain prosperity.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Prospect theory suggests that people are risk-averse when facing gains, but risk-prone when facing losses, a pattern known as the framing effect. Although framing effects have been widely demonstrated, few studies have investigated framing effects under conditions of need. Risk-sensitivity theory predicts that decision makers should prefer high-risk options in situations of high need, when lower risk options are unlikely to meet those needs. In two experiments, we examined (1) whether framing effects occurred in behavioural tasks involving risky decision making from description and decision making from experience, (2) whether participants' risky decision making conformed to the predictions of risk-sensitivity theory, and (3) whether decision framing interacted with conditions of need to influence decision making under risk. The results suggest that under all circumstances, risky decision making conformed to the predictions of risk-sensitivity theory. Framing effects were at least partially demonstrable under all experimental conditions. Finally, negative frames interacted with situations of high need to produce particularly elevated levels of risky choice. Together, the results suggest that risk-sensitivity theory can augment prospect theory to explain choice under conditions of need. © 2011 The British Psychological Society.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: Behavioral economics research has revealed systematic biases in decision making that merit consideration in efforts to promote money management skills among those with substance use disorders (SUDs). Objectives: The objective of this article was to briefly review the literature on five of those biases (i.e., hyperbolic delay discounting, defaults and preference for the status quo, loss aversion, mental accounting, and failure to account for opportunity cost) that may have particular relevance to the topic of money management. Methods: Selected studies are reviewed to illustrate these biases and how they may relate to efforts to promote money management skills among those with substance use disorders. Studies were identified by searching PubMed using the terms \"behavioral economics\" and \"substance use disorders\", reviewing bibliographies of published articles, and discussions with colleagues. Results: Only one of these biases (i.e., hyperbolic delay discounting) has been investigated extensively among those with SUDs. Indeed, it has been found to be sufficiently prevalent among those with SUDs to be considered as a potential risk factor for those disorders and certainly merits careful consideration in efforts to improve money management skills in that population. There has been relatively little empirical research reported regarding the other biases among those with SUDs, although they appear to be sufficiently fundamental to human behavior and relevant to the topic of money management (e.g., loss aversion) to also merit consideration. There is precedent of effective leveraging of behavioral economics principles in treatment development for SUDs (e.g., contingency management), including at least one intervention that explicitly focuses on money management (i.e., advisorteller money management therapy). Conclusions and Scientific Significance: The consideration of the systematic biases in human decision making that have been revealed in behavioral economics research has the potential to enhance efforts to devise effective strategies for improving money management skills among those with SUDs. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of product market characteristics on the decision to go public. When firms decide to go public or remain private, they trade off product market related costs and benefits. Costs arise from the loss of confidential information to competitors, e.g., in the IPO prospectus and subsequent mandated public disclosures, while benefits emerge from raising capital allowing the firm to strengthen its position in the product market. Our results show that UK firms are more likely to go public when they operate in a more profitable industry and in an industry with lower barriers to entry. These firms are more likely to go public in order to improve their position in the product market and to deter new entrants into the industry. However, firms from more competitive industries and firms with smaller market share are less likely to go public. For these firms the loss of confidential information to rivals outweighs the benefits of going public. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

Under these conditions, the question of blocking and controlling empathy becomes a central issue to channel empathic attention and to avoid self-loss (Step 2). It is assumed that empathy can be sustained only when these mechanisms of controlling empathy are bypassed (Step 3). In particular, the article proposes a three-person scenario with one observing a conflict of two others.

Here we contribute to this burgeoning literature by extending it to a number of key behavioral anomalies that are thought to be of importance for consumption, savings, and portfolio selection decisions. Using survey-based evidence from more than 11,000 Swedish twins, we demonstrate that a number of anomalies such as, for instance, the conjunction fallacy, default bias, and loss aversion are moderately heritable. In contrast, our estimates imply that variation in common environment explains only a small share of individual differences. We also report suggestive evidence in favor of a shared genetic architecture between cognitive reflection and a subset of the studied anomalies. These results offer some support for the proposition that the heritable variation in behavioral anomalies is partly mediated by genetic variance in cognitive ability. Taken together with previous findings, our results underline the importance of genetic differences as a source of heterogeneity in economic and financial decision making. © 2012 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Adaptive behaviour requires an ability to obtain rewards by choosing between different risky options. Financial gambles can be used to study effective decisionmaking experimentally, and to distinguish processes involved in choice option evaluation from outcome feedback and other contextual factors. Here, we used a paradigm where participants evaluated 'mixed' gambles, each presenting a potential gain and a potential loss and an associated variable outcome probability. We recorded neural responses using autonomic monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG) and functional neuroimaging (fMRI), and used a univariate, parametric design to test for correlations with the eleven economic parameters that varied across gambles, including expected value (EV) and amount magnitude. Consistent with behavioural economic theory, participants were risk-averse. Gamble evaluation generated detectable autonomic responses, but only weak correlations with outcome uncertainty were found, suggesting that peripheral autonomic feedback does not play a major role in this task. Long-latency stimulus-evoked EEG potentials were sensitive to expected gain and expected value, while alpha-band power reflected expected loss and amount magnitude, suggesting parallel representations of distinct economic qualities in cortical activation and central arousal. Neural correlates of expected value representation were localized using fMRI to ventromedial prefrontal cortex, while the processing of other economic parameters was associated with distinct patterns across lateral prefrontal, cingulate, insula and occipital cortices including default-mode network and early visual areas. These multimodal data provide complementary evidence for distributed substrates of choice evaluation across multiple, predominantly cortical, brain systems wherein distinct regions are preferentially attuned to specific economic features. Our findings extend biologically-plausible models of risky decision-making while providing potential biomarkers of economic representations that can be applied to the study of deficits in motivational behaviour in neurological and psychiatric patients. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When choosing between options, people often distort new information in a direction that favors their developing preference. Such information distortion is widespread and robust, but less is known about the magnitude of its effects. In particular, research has not quantified the effects of distortion relative to the values of the choice options. In two experiments, we manipulated participants' initial preferences in choices between risky three-outcome monetary gambles (win, lose, or neither) by varying the order of five information items (e. g., amount to win, chance of losing). In Experiment 1 (N = 397), the effect of initial information on gambles' certainty equivalents (subjective values) was mediated by the distortion of later information. The indirect effect on the difference between gambles' certainty equivalents averaged 27% of the gambles' mean expected value. In Experiment 2 (N = 791), we increased the difference between gambles on a later information item to overcome the effect of initial information on participants' choices. The required change averaged 31% of the gambles' mean expected value. We conclude that the effects of information distortion can be substantial. © 2011 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: When decisions are made in the presence of high-dimensional stochastic data, handling joint distribution of correlated random variables can present a formidable task, both in terms of sampling and estimation as well as algorithmic complexity. A common heuristic is to estimate only marginal distributions and substitute joint distribution by independent (product) distribution. In this paper, we study possible loss incurred on ignoring correlations through a distributionally robust stochastic programming model, and we quantify that loss as price of correlations (POC). Using techniques of cost sharing from game theory, we identify a wide class of problems for which POC has a small upper bound. To our interest, this class will include many stochastic convex programs, uncapacitated facility location, Steiner tree, and submodular functions, suggesting that the intuitive approach of assuming independent distribution acceptably approximates the robust model for these stochastic optimization problems. Additionally, we demonstrate hardness of bounding POC via examples of subadditive and supermodular functions that have large POC. We find that our results are also useful for solving many deterministic optimization problems like welfare maximization, k-dimensional matching, and transportation problems, under certain conditions. © 2012 INFORMS.\u001b[0m :\n",

Kahneman and Tversky (1979), we consider decision making under risk in which the decision maker's preferences depend on a reference outcome. An outcome below this reference outcome is regarded as resulting from a loss: a loss decreases the decision maker's basic utility more than a comparable gain increases this utility. An elegant and simple way to model this phenomenon was proposed by Shalev (2002): the utility of an outcome below the reference outcome is obtained from the basic utility by subtracting a multiple of the loss in basic utility: this multiple, the loss aversion coefficient, is constant across different reference outcomes.

Offspring of HD patients may be exposed to adversity in childhood because of the parent's disease and its psychological consequences. BRCA1/2 hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2) increases the risk for offspring of being exposed to parental disease or loss. Childhood adversity is associated with psychopathology and various other problems in later life. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) before age 16 were assessed in adults at 50% risk for HD (n = 74) or BRCA1/2 (n = 82) and in controls (n = 101), using the Negative Life Events Scale. Mean number and occurrence of ACEs were compared between groups. The odds of having experienced adversity in childhood were higher in HD offspring and BRCA1/2 offspring than in controls. HD offspring reported a higher mean number of ACEs than controls or BRCA1/2 offspring. In HD offspring, the prevalence of parental disease and parental dysfunction experienced before age 16 was higher than in controls. In BRCA1/2 offspring, the prevalence of parental loss before age 16 was higher than in controls. This study indicates that 53% of HD offspring and 45% of BRCA1/2 offspring are exposed to adversity in childhood or adolescence.

      "Abstract: Among psychologists and economists, prospect theory continues to be one of the most popular models of decision making. The theory's key property is reference dependence; specifically, how an individual's perception of loss or gain is dependent upon their starting point (i.e., the status quo). Although prospect theory is widely accepted, other authors have sought the inclusion of reference points besides the status quo. Initially these extensions focused on the importance of single reference points such as goals. More recently, authors have explained choice data by including multiple reference points within the value function. Multiple-reference-point theories generally assume that many choice situations possess an implicit or explicit goal, or point an individual will strive to obtain, and/or a minimum requirement (i.e., a \"lower bound\") above which an individual will strive to stay. In two experiments, we present evidence that individuals can utilize the minimum requirement, status quo, and goal within a single risky decision task. Participants most often chose to maximize their chance of reaching reference points even when that decision was riskier, resulted in lower expected value, resulted in lower expected utility, or ran contrary to the predictions of prospect theory. Furthermore, salience and uncertainty moderated the use of goals and minimum requirements as reference points. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Temporal discounting is a process by which the perceived value of an outcome decreases as delay increases. Social discounting is a process by which the perceived value of an outcome decreases as the social distance between the decision-maker and recipient increases. Both temporal and social discounting are well established for monetary outcomes. However, little is known regarding the effect of delay-to-occurrence or increased social distance on the perceived value of social interactions. The current study demonstrates that the decrease in perceived value for delayed social interactions is well described by the same hyperbola-like function used for monetary outcomes and that the rate of discounting decreases (indicating increased preference for larger, more delayed outcomes) as social distance increases. Conceptualizing the current discounting procedure as entailing both potential gains and losses, suggest that under certain circumstances, higher discount rates may not reflect increased preference. © 2011 Elsevier B.V..\u001b[0m :\n",

A combination of telephone and web survey data are used to assess the impact of coastal wind farms on trip behavior and site choice. Most of the respondents to our telephone survey claim to support offshore wind energy development, and independent survey data suggest that the observed levels of support may be indicative of the broader population in this region. Overall, we find very little impact of coastal wind turbines on aggregate recreational visitation; loss in annual consumer surplus associated with wide spread wind development in the coastal zone is insignificant at $17 (or about 1.5% of annual consumer surplus). Results suggest that NC local coastal tourists are averse to wind farms in the near-shore zone; average compensating variation for wind farms one mile from the shore is estimated at $55 per household. On average, we find no evidence of aversion to wind farms 4 miles out in the ocean, or for wind farms located in coastal estuaries. For all wind farm scenarios, we find evidence of preference heterogeneity-some respondents find this appealing while others find it aversive. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Reward probability and uncertainty are two fundamental parameters of decision making. Whereas reward probability indicates the prospect of winning, reward uncertainty, measured as the variance of probability, indicates the degree of risk. Several lines of evidence have suggested that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays an important role in reward processing. What is lacking is a quantitative analysis of the encoding of reward probability and uncertainty in the human ACC. In this study, we addressed this issue by analyzing the feedback-related negativity (FRN), an event-related potential (ERP) component that reflects the ACC activity, in a simple gambling task in which reward probability and uncertainty were parametrically manipulated through predicting cues. Results showed that at the outcome evaluation phase, while both win and loss-related FRN amplitudes increased as the probability of win or loss decreased, only the win-related FRN was modulated by reward uncertainty. This study demonstrates the rapid encoding of reward probability and uncertainty in the human ACC and offers new insights into the functions of the ACC. © 2011 Yu et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This research examines how young adults' attitudes toward human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and their intentions to get the vaccine are influenced by the framing of health messages (gain vs. loss) and time orientation (i.e., the extent to which people value immediate vs. distant consequences of their decisions). Results of an experiment showed an overall persuasive advantage for loss-framed messages. Attitudes and behavioral intentions toward HPV vaccination were found to be more favorable among future-minded individuals. Moreover, an interaction between framing and time orientation was found to predict persuasive outcomes. Present-minded participants responded more favorably to the loss-framed message, whereas future-minded participants were equally persuaded by both frames. Implications of the findings for vaccine risk communication are discussed. © 2011 International Communication Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Attitudes toward risks are central to organizational decisions. These attitudes are commonly modeled by prospect theory. Construal level theory has been proposed as an alternative theory of risky choice, accounting for psychological distance deriving from temporal, spatial and social aspects of risk that are typical of agency situations. Unnoticed in the literature, the two theories make contradicting predictions. The current study investigates which theory provides a better description of risky decisions in the presence of temporal, spatial, and social factors. We find that the psychophysical effects modeled by prospect theory dominate the psychological distance effects of construal level theory. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The present study elucidates that the illusion of framing in risky decisions is induced by the expected losses with the shift of independent or complementary schemata. Throughout three studies, the reversal of risk preferences in the gain and loss frames was confirmed when the expected number of losses was unknown. When it was known, however, the reversal was reduced in Study 2 where the decision makers were informed of all the options in both frames, and eliminated in Study 3 where they elaborated the numbers of lives at stake before making decisions. Further, the complementary schema was more pervasive when the number of expected losses was known, while the independent schema was more common when the number was unknown. These results imply that the illusion of framing is due to the shift of schemata concerning the lives saved and lost. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: It frequently has been observed that people discount future rewards relative to present rewards. However, the literature on intertemporal choices involving emotional upsets and losses is fraught with inconsistencies, with some studies finding similar discounting of gains and losses, and others reporting that participants elect to undergo negative experiences sooner rather than later. To help resolve these contradictions, time preferences for different types of aversive experiences (social rejection, embarrassment, pain, monetary and property loss) were examined in five studies. Most participants preferred to postpone monetary and property losses, but intertemporal choices for other unpleasant experiences showed highly variable responses, with some participants deferring them as long as possible, and many electing to experience them immediately. Time preferences for these negative experiences were correlated, but were independent of time preference for rewards. It is argued (following Loewenstein, 1987) that anticipation of dread plays a key role in many people's choices about timing of aversive experiences. This interpretation was supported by choices about when to learn of a very unpleasant event whose timing was fixed (Study 3), and by a novel preference reversal (Study 4). Study 5 examined how actual and hypothetical experiences of dread unfolded over time; the results were consistent with a dread-based interpretation of choices in the preceding studies. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: We use a laboratory experiment to study the extent to which investors' choices are affected by limited loss deduction in income taxation. We first compare investment behavior in the no tax baseline to a tax control setting, in which the income from investments is taxed. We find that investors significantly reduce their risk-taking as predicted by theory. Next we compare the baseline investment choices to choices under three different types of income taxation. We observe that risk-taking is significantly increased with partial and with capped loss deduction, but is unaffected by a tax system that allows no loss deduction. Since in all these treatments the after tax outcomes of the prospects were identical, we conjecture that investors have a positively biased perception of partial and capped loss deduction that promotes their willingness to take risks. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Introduction and aims: Cosmetic tourism, driven by the promise of inexpensive operations abroad, is increasingly popular despite warnings from professional bodies regarding associated risks. Increasing numbers of individuals have presented to our department requesting NHS treatment of complications from such surgery. We set out to characterize these patients and evaluate costs incurred through their assessment and management. Material and methods: An observational study was conducted from 2007 to 2009 on patients presenting to a tertiary referral Plastic Surgery practice with complications of cosmetic tourism surgery. Demographic characteristics, as well as those related to the operation, were recorded. Hospital patient flow pathways were constructed, cost analysis performed using Patient Level Costing, and expenditure and profitability calculated. Key results: Nineteen patients presented within the study period. Most operations were performed in Europe or Asia, and were primarily breast augmentation procedures (n = 13). The principal complications were wound infection or dehiscence, and poor cosmetic results. Eleven patients received NHS treatment, at a cost of £120,841. The mean cost for all patients' management was £6360 (range: £114-£57, 968), rising to £10,878 for those accepted for treatment. For 8 of the 9 patients (89%) for whom full patient level costing was available, the hospital incurred a financial loss. Conclusion: The costs to the NHS of managing complications of cosmetic tourism are substantial, and underestimated by central funding agencies. © 2011 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

      "Abstract: Regulatory policy is a considerable factor in organizational business strategy decisions. This article puts focus on the evaluation of the regulatory policy from the perspective of the organizational cost under uncertainty. In this paper I examine the organizational cost of policy transition in different scenarios, and consider, further, what the impact on the macroeconomic and business policy would be. Three conclusions are reached: 1. The cost of strategy adoption of organizations under regulation in a monopolized industry is only affected by their own risk tolerance of uncertainty and the cost of information; 2. when the regulation is enacted in a more competitive market, the cost of information would raise with a higher expected loss comparing with the same regulation in monopolized market; 3. If the claim of such measurement is true, the net benefit or loss of regulation is exactly the difference between organizational information cost and regulatory benefit. So the policy that guarantees the positive communication and transparent information exchange that helps to reduce the organizational information cost is necessary for an efficient regulatory policy.\u001b[0m :\n",

The aim of this study was to assess self-perception of subjects that became involved with a multifaceted group weight loss programme. Material and methods: The study group involved 80 obese subjects starting a three month multifaceted group weight loss programme (age 41, 8±11.9 years, BMI 35.7±5.3 kg/m2). At the commencement of the first meetinq body self-perception was assessed using the Figure Rating Scale adapted by Stunkard's (FRS), followed by anthropometric measurements and BMI calculation. The figures corresponding to the calculated BMI were compared with the figures selected by the participants using the FRS scale. Results: In 78.7% (n=63) of subjects, body self-perception was parallel to BMI. Whereas in the remaining 21 3% (n=17) of subjects, body self-perception differed from the BMI. Seven subjects visualised their own figure as more obese and 10 subjects perceived their own figure as less obese. The increased disturbance of body self-perception correlated positively with age, body mass, and BMI (r=0.32, p=0.005; r=0.30, p=0.01 and r=0.34, p=0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Body self-perception in the majority of obese subjects beginning a multifaceted group weight loss programme is accurate. Increased disturbance in self-perception of obesity corresponds with increases of age, body mass, and BMI.\u001b[0m :\n",

It focuses on three specific types of price cues: a low and plausible price cue, a high but implausible price cue, and a range price cue that is bounded at the upper end by the high price cue and at the lower end by the low price cue. A controlled experiment indicates that consumers perceive the range and low price cue as more useful in aiding their bidding decisions than the high price cue. The range and low price cue positively impact bidders? confidence in winning while the high price cue reduces their confidence level. Interestingly, consumers? value and bid judgments? can be influenced by the high price cue even though they view it with skepticism. The low end of a range price cue is found to have a greater impact on consumers? perceptions and bid judgments than the high end, possibly because a range price cue has the potential to make loss aversion more pronounced.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Research on self-serving biases in judgments and decision-making suggests that individu-als first evaluate the outcomes they get, and then the procedures by which these outcomes were obtained. Evidence also suggests that the appraisal of the former (outcome favora-bility) can bias the appraisal of the latter (procedural fairness). We investigated the nature of the emotions that are elicited by these appraisals by using a new paradigm in which participants performed a choice task between pairs of competing gambles against a virtual opponent. Conflicts (when the participant selected the same gamble as his virtual oppo-nent) were resolved by a neutral arbitrator who either confirmed the participant's choice (\"pro-self \") or attributed his gamble to the virtual opponent (\"pro-competitor\"). Trials in which the participant and his virtual opponent selected different gambles (\"no-conflict\") served as a control condition. In order to validate this new task, emotional reactions to the outcomes of the gambles were measured using self-reports, skin conductance responses, and facial electromyography (zygomaticus, corrugator, and frontalis). In no-conflict trials, effects of counterfactual thinking and social comparison resulted in (i) increased happi-ness as well as SCR and zygomaticus activity for wins compared to losses (valence effect) and for high compared to low gains (magnitude effect), and (ii) increased anger, regret, disappointment, and envy for losses compared to wins (valence effect). More importantly, compared to no-conflict trials and to pro-self awards with similar outcomes, pro-competitor awards increased subjective reports of anger for unfavorable outcomes, and increased hap-piness and guilt for favorable outcomes. Although the outcomes were independent from the arbitrators' decisions, and both the arbitrators' decisions and the outcomes were kept equally likely, individuals tended to attribute their outcomes to unfair arbitrators, reacting emotionally, especially when the modification of their initial choice for a gamble led to a negative outcome. © 2011 Bediou, Mohri, Lack and Sander.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: The primary goal of the study was to identify to what extent older people modify their driving, what influences them to do so, and how self-regulatory behavior changes over time in relation to changes in perceived impairments and lifestyle characteristics. Methods: Participants 65 and older (n = 2650) were recruited while renewing their driver's licenses in Connecticut, Kentucky, and Rhode Island and were interviewed by telephone about current driving patterns, recent changes in driving, functional abilities related to driving (i.e., vision, memory, physical mobility, diagnosed medical conditions), crash involvements, and lifestyle characteristics. Participants were called annually to participate in follow-up telephone interviews; 2057 completed a second interview, 1698 completed 3 interviews, and 1437 completed all 4 interviews. Stepwise regression analyses examined how changes in impairments and life events (i.e., retiring, becoming widowed or divorced) related to changes in the number of miles driven during a typical week and in the number of driving situations avoided. Results: Based on information provided in the initial survey, participants who completed all 4 surveys were slightly younger, more likely to be married, slightly less impaired in terms of physical mobility and medical conditions, and drove more weekly miles and avoided fewer driving situations compared with those who dropped out. Participants who completed all 4 interviews reported driving an average of 94 miles per week in year 1 compared with 78 miles in year 4. Reported impairments generally were low to moderate and changed little. Analyses comparing years 1 and 4 indicated that drivers drove 35 fewer miles per week if they retired or lost their job and 61 fewer miles if they moved from a retirement home to a private home or assisted living. They drove 25 more miles per week on average if they became widowed or divorced. Small increases in the number of driving situations avoided were associated with increasing impairments in memory and mobility. Conclusions: Lifestyle changes such as becoming widowed or divorced or retiring were associated with changes in mileages. Older drivers with worsening memory and physical mobility regulated their driving to some extent by avoiding more driving situations, confirming the hypothesis that some older drivers do take steps to compensate for increases in some perceived impairments. However, during the 3-year study period, reported changes were not large, perhaps because older drivers with larger changes were among those who dropped out (46% of those who took the first survey). © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Previous academic research has documented that people experience disutility from potentially being exploited by others beyond what this exploitation may do to their wealth. Such a tendency is labeled as the demand for accountability in accounting, and the psychology behind this phenomenon is labeled more broadly as betrayal aversion in other fields such as sociology. Since the environment is not static for a decision maker, it is important to understand not only that betrayal aversion exists but also how/if its impact on individual decision making varies in response to environmental changes. In this study, we investigate if changed economic conditions (i.e., an economic downturn or upturn) would affect the level of betrayal aversion and its impact on a principal's internal control system choices. The results of our experiment suggest that while the level of betrayal aversion does not change with changed economic conditions, its relative importance on a principal's control system choice decreases (does not change) in an economic downturn (upturn). These findings are consistent with the notion that loss aversion dominates betrayal aversion in control system choices when decision makers are facing an economic downturn. This study suggests that the initial decision motivated by betrayal aversion cannot be assumed to be unaltered when the environment changes.\u001b[0m :\n",

The results of this study suggest a relationship between prudence and loan loss provisioning decisions; specifically, bank managers identified as less prudent recognize higher subsequent periodic loan loss provisions. This relationship is interpreted as a response to prior insufficient provisions for known losses and/or delays in recognizing current loan quality deterioration. These findings indicate that less prudent managers are less conservative in their accounting. These findings contribute to the literature by demonstrating that management may convey information about their organizational risk tolerance or other organizational characteristics via their provisioning judgment.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Background: The importance of involving parents in the end-of-life decision-making-process (EOL DMP) for their child in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is recognised by ethical guidelines in numerous countries. However, studies exploring parents' opinions on the type of involvement report conflicting results. This study sought to explore parents' experience of the EOL DMP for their child in the NICU. Methods: The study used a retrospective longitudinal design with a qualitative analysis of parental experience 3 years after the death of their child in four NICUs in France. 53 face-to-face interviews and 80 telephone interviews were conducted with 164 individuals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore how parents perceived their role in the decision process, what they valued about physicians' attitudes in this situation and whether their long-term emotional well being varied according to their perceived role in the EOL DMP. Findings: Qualitative analysis identified four types of perceived role in the DMP: shared, medical, informed parental decision, and no decision. Shared DM was the most appreciated by parents. Medical DM was experienced as positive only when it was associated with communication. Informed parental DM was associated with feelings of anxiousness and abandonment. The physicians' attitudes that were perceived as helpful in the long term were explicit sharing of responsibility, clear expression of staff preferences, and respectful care and language toward the child. Interpretation: Parents find it valuable to express their opinion in the EOL DMP of their child. Nonetheless, they do need continuous emotional support and an explicit share of the responsibility for the decision. As involvement preferences and associated feelings can vary, parents should be able to decide what role they want to play. However, our study suggests that fully autonomous decisions should be misadvised in these types of tragic choices. © 2011 Caeymaex et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The construct of risk taking is studied through the prism of the relation between tonic arousal and risk taking behavior. Several theories have proposed that high aroused individuals tend to exhibit risk aversion. We posit that this arousal-behavior association is activated much more strongly in risks with losses, as losses increase arousal and trigger relevant traits associated with the sensitivity to risk. In three studies we examined risk taking in experience-based decision tasks, with either token losses or relative-losses (in the gain domain). In Study 1 we found a negative correlation between pre-task pupil diameter and risk taking in the loss domain but not in the gain domain. In Study 2 we re-analyzed a previous pupillometry dataset involving symmetric mixed gains and losses. We found that the negative correlation in this mixed condition emerged even while the participants did not show loss aversion. This finding was replicated in Study 3. Thus, the effect of losses on arousal provides sufficient conditions for the moderation of the tonic arousal-behavior association. The findings suggest an important role for losses in the psychological and physiological experience of risk. © 2011 Yechiam and Telpaz.\u001b[0m :\n",

From 133 students (mean age 21.1, SD = 1.54; 43 men, 90 women) the majority showed loss aversion. A few students (N = 18) who showed low loss aversion differed from the very high loss averse students (N = 32) by using different criteria for evaluating themselves and others, by unstableness and ambivalence of these evaluations, and by contra identifications. Moreover, they disapproved of high-risk professions (such as racing drivers, gamblers and boxers) less than very high loss averse students did.

      "Abstract: The orbitofrontal cortex has been hypothesized to carry information regarding the value of expected rewards. Such information is essential for associative learning, which relies on comparisons between expected and obtained reward for generating instructive error signals. These error signals are thought to be conveyed by dopamine neurons. To test whether orbitofrontal cortex contributes to these error signals, we recorded from dopamine neurons in orbitofrontal-lesioned rats performing a reward learning task. Lesions caused marked changes in dopaminergic error signaling. However, the effect of lesions was not consistent with a simple loss of information regarding expected value. Instead, without orbitofrontal input, dopaminergic error signals failed to reflect internal information about the impending response that distinguished externally similar states leading to differently valued future rewards. These results are consistent with current conceptualizations of orbitofrontal cortex as supporting model-based behavior and suggest an unexpected role for this information in dopaminergic error signaling. © 2011 Nature America, Inc.

      "Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive framework for modeling continuous decisions about changing jobs that individuals make over the course of their lives. The key objective of the research was to develop disaggregate econometric models for decision making about job mobility and location choice to implement longitudinal job mobility behavior of people within a dynamic microsimulation-based integrated urban modeling system. The paper includes two behavioral model components: (a) a job mobility model and (b) a job location choice model. The models were implemented empirically with a retrospective survey of the greater Toronto and Hamilton area in Ontario, Canada. The first component investigated the timing of job mobility with the use of a competing risk duration modeling approach for four event types: a job switch, a return to school, short-term unemployment, and withdrawal from the labor force. The second component, job location choice, was empirically estimated by applying the discrete choice methodology. One of the key features of the model was that it examined the influence of current employment in making decisions about the next job location and specified a gain-loss utility structure by the prospect-theoretic, reference-dependent choice modeling approach. A mixed logit model was developed to account for unobserved heterogeneity in the location preferences. These models were expected to be implemented in the Integrated Land Use, Transportation, Environment (ILUTE) modeling system, which had recently been updated with comparable disaggregate behavioral residential location models.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: People create counterfactual alternatives that change an exceptional action to be like a usual one (e. g., \"if he had placed his usual small bet he would have lost less\"), as shown in Experiment 1. Experiments 2 and 3 eliminated and reversed this well-known effect: An exceptional action is instead changed to an exceptional alternative when it leads to a better outcome. Experiments 4 and 5 show that the reversal occurs whether or not the exceptional alternative is a justified action. The results indicate that the tendency to change an exceptional action to be like a usual one is guided by the optimality of the counterfactual outcome more than the exceptionality or justifiability of the action. The implications for theories of the counterfactual imagination are discussed. © 2011 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: A new unobtrusive measure of prejudice is proposed based on an advice-taking task. The computer-based task requires participants to find a token hidden behind one of two boxes. Prior to making their choice, however, someone (depicted by a name or a face) provides advice as to the token's location. An unobtrusive measure of prejudice is derived by manipulating the advice-giver's social group (e. g., male or female, Asian or White) and comparing the proportions of advice taken from each group. In Experiment 1, although the participants were not aware of it, they took more advice from males than from females. In Experiment 2, the relative proportion of advice taken from Asian versus White advice-givers correlated with responses to a news story pertaining to Asians. In Experiment 3, the relative proportion of advice taken from Asian versus White advice-givers correlated with scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT) and predicted discriminatory behaviour, as indexed by the lost e-mail technique, better than other measures. In Experiment 4, scores on the advice task were uncontaminated by social desirability concerns and reactance and reflected the relative amounts of trust that people placed in different social groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that the advice task may be a useful tool for researchers seeking an unobtrusive measure of prejudice with predictive validity. © 2011 Psychonomic Society, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: In consumption decisions, Thaler (1985) distinguishes acquisition and transaction utility. Whereas acquisition utility stands for the pleasure from obtaining a good, transaction utility denominates the value consumers derive from the deal itself. Transaction utility depends on a comparison of actual prices with reference to other prices such as the regular price. The present article reports two experimental studies demonstrating the effect of transaction utility on purchase decisions. In Experiment 1 (N = 90), on the basis of prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), it is expected that negative transaction utility affects purchase decisions to a higher degree than its positive counterpart. Results support this hypothesis. In Experiment 2 (N = 121) it is hypothesized that acquisition utility moderates the effect of transaction utility, that is, transaction utility becomes less important if a product is desired primarily for its actual value. Though both forms of utility affected purchase intentions, no support for the moderation hypothesis was observed. © 2011 Hogrefe Publishing.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This study tested the effectiveness of the framing effect and fear appeals to inform young people about the risks of multiple births and the option of selecting elective single-embryo transfer (eSET). A non-patient student sample (age (mean ± SD) 23 ± 5.5 years; n = 321) were randomly allocated to one of seven groups: (1) framing effect: (1a) gain and (1b) loss frame; (2) fear appeal: (2a) high, (2b) medium and (2c) low fear; or (3) a control group: (3a) education and (3b) non-education. The primary outcome measure was the Attitudes towards Single Embryo Transfer questionnaire, before exposure to the messages (time 1) and immediately afterwards (time 2). Results revealed participants in the high fear, medium fear and gain condition demonstrated the most positive and significant differences (P < 0.001 to P < 0.05) in their knowledge, hypothetical intentions and modest changes in attitudes towards eSET than the low fear, loss frame and education and non-education messages. The results demonstrate that the use of complex persuasive communication techniques on a student population to promote immediate and hypothetical eSET preferences is more successful at promoting eSET than merely reporting educational content. Future research should investigate its application in a clinical population. A multiple pregnancy is a health risk to both infant and mother following IVF treatment. The aims of this study were to test the effectiveness of two persuasive communication techniques (the framing effect and fear appeals) to inform young people about the risks of multiple births and the hypothetical option of selecting elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) (i.e., only one embryo is transferred to the uterus using IVF treatment). A total of 321 non-patient student sample (mean age 23) were randomly allocated to read a message from one of seven groups: (1) framing effect: (1a) gain and (1b) loss frame; (2) fear appeal: (2a) high, (2b) medium and (2c) low fear; or (3) a control group: education (3a) and (3b) non-education. Participants completed the Attitudes towards Single Embryo Transfer questionnaire, before exposure to the messages (time 1) and immediately afterwards (time 2). Results revealed that participants in the high fear, medium fear and gain condition demonstrated the most positive and significant differences in their knowledge, hypothetical intentions and modest changes in attitudes towards eSET than the low fear, loss frame and education and non-education messages. This study recommends that health promotion based on the framing effect and fear appeals should be tested in clinical (patient) samples in the future. © 2011, Taiwanese Dermatological Association.

      "Abstract: Abstract This article examines the determinants of public support for the use of military force. It puts forward a Framing Theory of Policy Objectives (FTPO), which contends that public support for military engagements depends on the public's perception of the policy's objective. However, it is difficult for the public to judge a policy's objective because they cannot directly observe a policy's true intention and influential political actors offer competing frames to define it. This framing contestation, carried out through the media, sets the public's decision-making reference point and determines whether the policy is perceived as seeking to avoid losses or to achieve gains. The FTPO predicts that support will increase when the public perceives policies as seeking to prevent losses and decrease when the public judges policies to be seeking gains. I operationalize and test the theory using content analysis of national news coverage and opinion polls of U.S. intervention in Central America during the 1980s. These framing effects are found to hold regardless of positive or negative valence of media coverage. © The IO Foundation 2011.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Monkey studies report greater activity in the lateral intraparietal area and more efficient saccades when targets coincide with the location of prior reward cues, even when cue location does not indicate which responses will be rewarded. This suggests that reward can modulate spatial attention and visual selection independent of the \"action value\" of the motor response. Our goal was first to determine whether reward modulated visual selection similarly in humans, and next, to discover whether reward and penalty differed in effect, if cue effects were greater for cognitively demanding antisaccades, and if financial consequences that were contingent on stimulus location had spatially selective effects. We found that motivational cues reduced all latencies, more for reward than penalty. There was an \"inhibition-of-return\"-like effect at the location of the cue, but unlike the results in monkeys, cue valence did not modify this effect in prosaccades, and the inhibition-of-return effect was slightly increased rather than decreased in antisaccades. When financial consequences were contingent on target location, locations without reward or penalty consequences lost the benefits seen in noncontingent trials, whereas locations with consequences maintained their gains. We conclude that unlike monkeys, humans show reward effects not on visual selection but on the value of actions. The human saccadic system has both the capacity to enhance responses to multiple locations simultaneously, and the flexibility to focus motivational enhancement only on locations with financial consequences. Reward is more effective than penalty, and both interact with the additional attentional demands of the antisaccade task. © 2011 IBRO.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Global brands emerging from the world of sports are becoming commonplace, and firms invest in the realm of sports, usually through sponsorship initiatives, to get a link with these global brands. Over and above just a mere business link, what if a company makes a personal commitment to get into the core of a renowned, celebrated sports team? This article provides managers with a procedure to analyze, in a weekly basis, how valuable this type of decision is. A conceptual model shows that the personal involvement of a firm's figurehead in a first-class sports club can impact positively on firm value if the person is doing well in the task s/he is entrusted with by the club. The empirical application to the soccer club Real Madrid, over 1,409 days and 215 matches, finds that the club's performance on the field has a significant impact on the economic returns of its president's company, with asymmetrical effects on firm value in a \"loss aversion\" pattern, that is, lost matches have a greater effect on firm value than games won. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

      "Abstract: Human cooperative behaviour, as assayed by decisions in experimental economic dilemmas such as the Dictator Game, is variable across human populations. Within-population variation has been less well studied, especially within industrial societies. Moreover, little is known about the extent to which community-level variation in Dictator Game behaviour relates to community-level variation in real-world social behaviour. We chose two neighbourhoods of the city of Newcastle upon Tyne that were similar in most regards, but at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of level of socioeconomic deprivation. We administered Dictator Games to randomly-selected residents, and also gathered a large number of more naturalistic measures of cooperativeness. There were dramatic differences in Dictator Game behaviour between the two neighbourhoods, with the mean allocation to the other player close to half the stake in the affluent neighbourhood, and close to one tenth of the stake in the deprived neighbourhood. Moreover, the deprived neighbourhood was also characterised by lower self-reported social capital, higher frequencies of crime and antisocial behaviour, a higher frequency of littering, and less willingness to take part in a survey or return a lost letter. On the other hand, there were no differences between the neighbourhoods in terms of the probability of helping a person who dropped an object, needed directions to a hospital, or needed to make change for a coin, and people on the streets were less likely to be alone in the deprived neighbourhood than the affluent one. We conclude that there can be dramatic local differences in cooperative behaviour within the same city, and that these need further theoretical explanation. © 2011 Nettle et al.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Four experiments were conducted to explore the robustness of risky choice framing among military decision makers. In the first experiment the original version of the Asian disease problem was administered. In contrast to Tversky and Kahneman's (1981) original findings, military decision makers were not influenced by the gain and loss framing. They demonstrated risk-seeking behavior in both domains. In the second experiment, we administered a military version of the Asian disease problem. We found a significant framing effect, but it was unidirectional: The decision makers were risk seeking in both domains, but significantly more risk seeking in the loss domain. To explore the strength of this risk-seeking preference, we altered the problem in a third experiment, making the risky alternative 12.5% less attractive than the certain one. Again, we found risk-seeking behavior in both domains. Finally, we explored reasons for these deviations from prospect theory by comparing the responses of business students and military officers. In this analysis, we observed significantly higher levels of self-efficacy in the military sample, as compared to the civil sample, and that the self-efficacy influenced risk seeking only in the military sample. In a post hoc analysis we also found that years of education reduced risk-seeking preference. Implications and directions for future research are discussed. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The ways of decision-making within the EU have significantly changed in the last decades: The rule of unanimity has been more and more substituted by majority voting in order to speed up decision-making processes in a Union of 27 heterogeneous member states. A third possibility is now offered by the Lisbon Treaty including a constitutional right of withdrawal. A member state encountering a loss in its benefits caused by a decision made by majority voting may now demand compensating transfers by using the right of withdrawal. It might threaten to leave the EU if the compensation is denied. Hence, does this mean that member states now have regained a negotiation power comparable to the right to veto? Using a game theoretic approach we investigate the amount of compensating transfers to be offered under majority decisions with exit option compared to decisions requiring unanimity. © 2010 The Author(s).\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: The paper is a continuation of studies aimed at verifying the hypothesis from decision theory stating that the risk in action is the greatest when the probability of loss is high, and the higher the value attached to that which is lost as a consequence of this action. Students of the Sport Championship School (n = 89) from fencing, track and field, martial arts and football classes took part in the studies. The age of the study participants was in the range 16-18 years. The experimental technique \"Perception of risk of doping\" (author: H. Mroczkowska) was used to help to determine the individual ranking of possible losses of valued goods as a consequence of doping use (loss of health; loss of medal; loss of physical attractiveness; loss of emotional balance; loss of material reward; loss of respect from others). It turns out that the hierarchy of the values that may be lost as a consequence of doping variously influences the assessment of the real and subjective risk and concerns various areas of evaluation. The assessment of the objective risk depends more on the rank of what may be lost (health) than on what may be gained (medals). Moreover, direct external sanctions are not perceived as more probable than remote personal consequences (psychophysical health). In the real situation of decision making about doping, the internalized hierarchy of values has no greater significance; in the real danger of a doping disclosure, everything that can be lost turns out to be equally valuable.\u001b[0m :\n",

We use elite semi-structured interviews, with a sample of 15 operational risk consultants from a leading international financial institution. Using content analysis, the data covers a wide range of business areas, with particular attention drawn towards the development of internal loss collection and operational risk management. The results suggest that the development of operational risk management as a function stems from external compliance (Basel II) and the internal pressure to add value to the business portfolio. This need for compliance was augmented as a driver of internal loss data collection; however, participants also recognised that the function of loss data collection is a tool of solid internal risk management and enhances managerial decision-making. The research also highlights the problems in cleansing data in order to ensure that all information implemented in the capital allocation model is valid and reliable. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: This paper reports the results of two experiments designed to examine users' assessment of the provision of nonaudit services (NAS) on auditor independence. By design, each experiment includes a different decision context. In the first experiment, users witness a large decline in asset value and decide whether to sue the auditor in an effort to recoup losses (as often occurs with accounting scandals). In the second experiment, users assess asset value, which offers a more mundane context. We contend that decision context influences users' motives, such that the auditor's provision of NAS is interpreted opportunistically. Indeed, we find that decision context dramatically affects users' perceptions. Our findings have implications for regulators, who face the daunting challenge of mandating rules/laws to ensure auditor independence. The task becomes more difficult when users' assessment of auditor independence is malleable, varying across decision contexts.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Approximately 70% of adults older than 60 years will lose decision-making capacity at the end of their lives, requiring a surrogate to make decisions about increasingly complex life-prolonging interventions. Surrogate decision makers play an important role, yet little is known about the long-term impact on them of making decisions. This study, a causal-comparative study, used social networks to survey adults who have experienced the death of a loved one in multiple hospital and nonhospital settings. Surrogate decision makers were compared with non-decision makers, using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. In a sample of 339 subjects, 37% had served as surrogate decision makers. Comparison of mean scores on the three subscales: intrusion, avoidance, and hyperarousal, indicated that both decision makers and non-decision makers experienced mild to moderate distress within the previous week. Younger surrogate decision makers reported significantly greater symptoms of intrusion and hyperarousal. Non-decision makers' distress diminished over time, but decision makers continued to experience intrusion, even though for most the death had been more than 5 years prior to the survey. Previous experiences with death of loved ones are important considerations even when losses occurred many years in the past. While all bereaved individuals experience varying degrees of distress, surrogate decision makers have unique vulnerability for long-term psychological morbidity.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Accountability-the expectation on the side of the decision maker that she may have to justify her decisions in front of somebody else-has been found by psychologists to strongly influence decision-making processes. The awareness of this issue remains however limited amongst economists, who tend to focus on the motivational effects of financial incentives. Accountability and incentives may provide different motivations for decision makers, and disentangling their effects is thus important for understanding real-world situations in which both are present. Separating accountability and incentives, I find different effects. Accountability is found to reduce preference reversals between frames, for which incentives have no effect. Incentives on the other hand are found to reduce risk seeking for losses, where accountability has no effect. In a choice task between simple and compound events, accountability increases the preference for the normatively superior simple event, while incentives have a weaker effect going in the opposite direction. © 2011 Economic Science Association.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Problem gambling (PG) is increasingly conceptualized as an addiction akin to substance abuse, rather than an impulse control disorder, however the mechanism of addiction remains unclear. Neuroimaging investigations have supported a \" reward deficiency\" hypothesis for PG by suggesting a blunted response to gambling, particularly in the striatum. Here we describe electrophysiological evidence of a hypersensitive response to gambling feedback in problem gamblers. Previous research in healthy participants has shown that feedback during gambling tasks triggers stereotypical neural responses including the Feedback-Related Mediofrontal Negativity (FRN), the feedback-related P300, and an increase in induced theta-band (4-8. Hz) power. We tested the theory that abnormal feedback processing characterizes brain activity in problem gamblers while gambling. EEG was recorded from non-gamblers and self-identified gamblers as they engaged in a computerized version of the Iowa Gambling Task. Feedback about valence (win vs. loss) triggered a FRN in both groups, but in gamblers this was preceded by an early-latency hypersensitive fronto-central difference to feedback. This early FRN was correlated with gambling severity and was localized to medial frontal cortex using distributed source imaging (CLARA). Gamblers also differed in responses to risk, showing a blunted P300 component and less EEG power in the theta band. Here we suggest that a more nuanced interpretation of reward deficiency is called for with respect to PG. For certain aspects of brain function, gamblers may exhibit hypersensitivity to reward feedback more akin to drug sensitization than reward deficiency. Our results also suggest that the neurologically normal brain employs dissociable systems in the processing of feedback from tasks involving risky decision making. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Rationale: Alcohol impairs the brain's detection of performance errors as evidenced by attenuated error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential (ERP) thought to reflect a brain system that monitors one's behavior. However, it remains unclear whether alcohol impairs performance-monitoring capacity across a broader range of contexts, including those entailing external feedback. Objective: This study sought to determine whether alcohol-related monitoring deficits are specific to internal recognition of errors (reflected by the ERN) or occur also in external cuing contexts. We evaluated the impact of alcohol consumption on the feedback-related negativity (FRN), an ERP thought to engage a similar process as the ERN but elicited by negative performance feedback in the environment. Methods: In an undergraduate sample randomly assigned to drink alcohol (n=37; average peak BAC=0.087 g/100 ml, estimated from breath alcohol sampling) or placebo beverages (n=42), ERP responses to gain and loss feedback were measured during a two-choice gambling task. Time-frequency analysis was used to parse the overlapping theta-FRN and delta-P3 and clarified the effects of alcohol on the measures. Results: Alcohol intoxication attenuated both the theta-FRN and delta-P3 brain responses to feedback. The theta-FRN attenuation was stronger following loss than gain feedback. Conclusions: Attenuation of both theta-FRN and delta-P3 components indicates that alcohol pervasively attenuates the brain's response to feedback in this task. That theta-FRN attenuation was stronger following loss trials is consistent with prior ERN findings and suggests that alcohol broadly impairs the brain's recognition of negative performance outcomes across differing contexts. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.\u001b[0m :\n",

      "Abstract: Objectives: The benefits of paternal investment have long been explored by assessing the impact of father's presence on child wellbeing. Previous studies, however, have only examined the average effect of father's presence on child survivorship. Here we assess the total fitness cost to men of deserting (or the benefit of staying), by considering effects on the entire progeny. We estimate the total number of children that a deserting father can expect to lose due to reduced survivorship over the life course in five populations, and compare this loss to the benefit gains from remarrying a younger wife. Methods: We compiled the observed impacts of father's absence, as well as mortality and fertility schedules, for five foraging or foraging/horticultural populations. We calculate how many additional children a man can expect to lose due to father's absence throughout a marriage. We then calculate the minimum age difference between a first and second spouse that would be necessary to overcome this cost. Results: Because child mortality rates drop so rapidly, the costs that men experience from desertion due to augmented child mortality are modest throughout marriage. Even hypothetically inflated father effects can be overcome with modest age differences between first and second spouses. Conclusions: Returns to paternal investment in terms of increased child survival are not substantial compared to those received by successfully practicing a serial mating strategy. This suggests that factors other than the ability to enhance child survival, such as female choice, are important to the evolutionary history and continued adaptive functioning of men's unique reproductive strategies. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.\u001b[0m :\n",
